Since his objection was limited to that section, I changed the NPOV to a <nowiki>{{SectNPOV}}<\/nowiki> tag in the section \"The decision\" (I assume that was the section he meant).

The original editor probably didn't consult the book itself.  I've looked in the book and the quote isn't found on page 107.  The index suggests the topic of prayer in school was discussed on 410 but unfortunately the copy I have was printed without the pages 403-434 and I can't check for it there.  If you have a copy you might help look there.  It's not unlikely that the quote is there given the separation of church and state, religious right, and prayer in schools are issues touched on in the book.  But I've been unable to verify the quote either.  I'll make a note of this in the article to see if another editor can verify it there on another page than 107, but this article doesn't get much traffic and the note is likely to go unnoticed. It should be removed if it isn't verified to ''Ain't Nobody's Business If You Do'' within the next week or so.

It was written and presented by [[Terry Jones]], and it challenges the received Roman and Roman Catholic notion of the [[barbarian]].\n\nProfessor [[Barry Cunliffe]] of the [[University of Oxford]] acted as consultant for the series.\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===1. \"The Primitive Celts\"===\n\nFirst broadcast 26 May 2006\n\nThe popular view of Celtic society is that it was [[Primitive culture|primitive]] and uncivilized. Terry Jones sets out to challenge this view. Far from being primitive compared to [[Rome]], it was an advanced society that was in some ways even more advanced than Rome. For example, many of the roads in [[Gaul]] that were assumed to have been built by the Romans, turn out to have been built by the Celts themselves.<ref>{{cite news| url=http:\/\/www.timesonline.co.uk\/tol\/news\/article714033.ece | location=London | work=The Times | title=Decline and fall of the Roman myth | date=7 May 2006}}<\/ref> However, Gaul was rich and tempting to Rome. The Roman general,  [[Julius Caesar]], set out to conquer Gaul with a professional army. The Celts stood no chance against Caesar and the Romans, and so today what we have is Rome's version of history.\n*[[Celt]]ic Barbarians\n*Caesar's [[Gallic Wars]]\n\n===2. \"The Savage Goths\"===\n\nFirst broadcast 2 June 2006\n*[[Arminius]]\n*[[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]]\n*[[Alaric I]]'s sack of Rome\n\n===3. \"The Brainy Barbarians\"===\nFirst broadcast 9 June 2006\n\nJones argues that the ancient Greeks and Persians were in reality far from the Roman view of them as effeminate and addicted to luxury. The Greeks valued science and mathematics, while the Persians had initially allowed multiculturalism among the different ethnic groups of its empire (until years of war with Rome).\n*[[Antikythera Mechanism]]\n*[[Archimedes]] and [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]\n*[[Parthians]]\n*[[Sassanids]]\n\n===4. \"The End of the World\"===\nFirst broadcast 16 June 2006\n\nAround 400 AD, two Barbarian babies were born. One would grow up to become the most feared of all - [[Attila the Hun]]. The other, [[Geiseric]], led the [[Vandals]] whom history has cast as destroyers. Jones claims that [[Roman civilization]] wasn't destroyed by the invasion of these tribes, but by the loss of the North African tax base. He sees the common view of Rome and \"Barbarians\" as a result of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] popularizing the Roman version of the truth.\n\n*[[Sack of Rome (455)]]\n\n==Companion book==\n* {{cite book\n | date  = 1 June 2006\n | title = Terry Jones' Barbarians\n | last = Jones\n | first =  Terry & Alan Ereira \n | publisher = [[BBC Books]] (hardcover)\n | isbn = 978-0-563-49318-1\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | date  = 7 June 2007\n | title = Terry Jones' Barbarians\n | last = Jones\n | first =  Terry & Alan Ereira \n | publisher = [[BBC Books]] (paperback)\n | isbn = 978-0-563-53916-2\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/pressoffice\/bbcworldwide\/worldwidestories\/pressreleases\/2006\/03_march\/barbarians.shtml BBC Worldwide press release]\n* {{IMDb title|0905688|Terry Jones' Barbarians}}\n\n{{Terry Jones history series}}\n\n[[Category:BBC television documentaries about history]]\n[[Category:Middle Ages]]\n[[Category:Works by Terry Jones]]","timestamp":"20160410105152","user-timestamp":"20150410105152"},{"title":"Inge Scholl","content":"{{Refimprove|date=February 2010}}\n\n{{Infobox person\n| name          = Inge Aicher-Scholl\n| image         = Weingarten Geschwister-Scholl-Schule Grundstufe 2.jpg\n| imagesize     = \n| caption       = Commemorative plaque to Inge Aicher-Scholl.\n| birthname     = Inge Scholl\n| birth_date    = {{birth date|1917|8|11|df=y}}\n| birth_place   = [[Ingersheim]], Germany\n| death_date    = {{Death date and age|1998|9|4|1917|8|11|df=y}}\n| death_place   = [[Leutkirch im Allg\u00e4u]], Germany\n| death_cause   =  Cancer\n| resting_place =  \n| occupation    = \n| othername     =  \n| yearsactive   =  \n| spouse        = [[Otl Aicher]]\n| parents = [[Robert Scholl]] <br> Magdalena M\u00fcller\n| relatives = [[Hans Scholl]] (brother) <br> [[Sophie Scholl]] (sister)\n}}\n'''Inge Aicher-Scholl''' (11 August 1917 &ndash; 4 September 1998), born in present-day [[Crailsheim]], Germany was the daughter of [[Robert Scholl]], the mayor of [[Forchtenberg]], and was the elder sister of [[Hans Scholl|Hans]] and [[Sophie Scholl]], who studied at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]] in 1942, and were core members of the [[White Rose]] student resistance movement in [[Nazi]] Germany.

Due to this fighting the inhabitants would abandon the place to be occupied by the victors. From this evolved the Muslim word \"Pighawaan\" which meant an abandoned place.\n\nThe second version, refers to an incident when an American School Superintendent visited the place.

The Skeeters are members of the [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball]], which is an independent league not affiliated with [[Major League Baseball]]. They are in the Freedom Division. The Skeeters have played its home games at [[Constellation Field]] since the beginning of the 2012 season.\n\nThe Skeeters entered the Atlantic League as an expansion team in 2010. They are the first Atlantic League team to play outside of the [[Northeast US|Northeast]]; the team is also the first of a planned Western division to include four to six other teams.  On top of that the Skeeters are the first independent league baseball team in the [[Greater Houston]] metropolitan area since the [[Houston Buffaloes]]' final season in [[1961 in baseball|1961]], and they are also the first from the city of Sugar Land.\n\nThe team's name \"Skeeters\" is a [[Southern United States|Southern]] slang word for [[mosquito]], and was the result of a team-sponsored fan poll.<ref name=\"namesugarlandsteam1\">{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.namesugarlandsteam.com\/vote-for-your-favorite\/ |title=Three finalists named in Sugar Land name-the-team contest |publisher=Namesugarlandsteam.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-24}}<\/ref> Part of the reason for the naming is that mosquitoes are very common in the summer nights in Southeast Texas.<ref name=\"namesugarlandsteam1\"\/>\n\nThe Sugar Land Skeeters have played in one Atlantic League Championship (representing the Freedom Division) in 2014 which was their third season in Franchise History. However, they were swept 3-0 in a best-of-five game series to the [[Lancaster Barnstormers]].\n\n== Franchise history ==\nIn 2008, Sugar Land residents voted for the allocation of civic revenues toward the construction of a new [[baseball park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/ballparkdigest.com\/200912082368\/independent-baseball\/news\/sugar-land-seeks-proposals-for-ballpark |title=Sugar Land seeks proposals for ballpark |publisher=Ballparkdigest.com |date=2009-12-08 |accessdate=2011-04-24}}<\/ref>  Initially, the former [[Omaha Storm Chasers|Omaha Royals]] were interested in moving to the city, but eventually declined because of the construction of [[Werner Park]] in suburban Omaha.<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.ballparkdigest.com\/20081104616\/minor-league-baseball\/news\/todays-big-ballot-issue-new-ballpark-in-sugar-land |title=Today's big ballot issue: new ballpark in Sugar Land |publisher=Ballparkdigest.com |date=2008-11-04 |accessdate=2011-04-24}}<\/ref> City of Sugar Land officials contacted [[Opening Day Partners]] to build the ballpark in order to have the company's caliber of professional baseball in their region. The city knew that the [[Houston Astros]] of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) would not approve of an affiliated team in the [[Greater Houston]] area, so Sugar Land chose the independent circuit.  The [[American Association of Independent Professional Baseball|American Association]] and the [[United Baseball League]] were also considered since both organizations had teams located in Texas. The city decided on the Atlantic League mainly because Opening Day Partners' other teams were already members of that league. Sugar Land's entry in the Atlantic League was officially announced on May 18, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/ballparkdigest.com\/201005172772\/independent-baseball\/features\/atlantic-league-to-expand-to-sugar-land |title=Atlantic League to expand to Sugar Land |publisher=Ballparkdigest.com |date=2010-05-17 |accessdate=2011-04-24}}<\/ref>\n\nOn August 20, 2012, Matt O'Brien, the team's president, announced that they were signing former MLB pitcher [[Roger Clemens]].

Usually, in each annual All Star Game, the best players from the Freedom Division battle it out with the best players from the Liberty Division. However in the 2014 All Star Game, the best players from all around the league faced the Sugar Land Skeeters team. Surprisingly, the Skeeters won on their home field and in front of their home crowd  in a thriller with the score of 5-3. [[Nick Stavinoha]] was recognized with the MVP award for the game. The game attendance was 7,555 which was the fourth highest All Star Game attendance.\n\nOn September 17, 2015, the Sugar Land Skeeters announced their signing of former MLB All-Star [[Rafael Palmeiro]]. He had been in retirement for ten years. His son Patrick Palmeiro is also a member of the team.

Away games are heard on radio station [[KBRZ (AM)|KBRZ]].\n\n== Constellation Field ==\n\n=== History ===\nIn December 2010, [[StarTex Power]] bought the rights to name the future ballpark of the Skeeters. The initial name of the field was StarTex Power Field. A year later, StarTex merged with [[Constellation Energy Group|Constellation Energy]] and the name [[Constellation Field]] was born on December 2011.\n\nConstellation Field opened on April 26, 2012, when the Sugar Land Skeeters hosted the [[York Revolution]]. The ballpark cost $37 million to build and is owned by the City of Sugar Land. The exact address of the Constellation Field is 1 Stadium Dr, Sugar Land, TX 77498.\n\n=== Features ===\n* Bud Light Ice House\n* Wells Fargo Picnic Plaza\n* Memorial Herman Play Land\n* Distinctive Life Diamond Deck\n* Insperity Club\n\n== Logos and uniforms ==\n\nThe official colors of the Sugar Land Skeeters are imperial blue, nighttime black, rawhide yellow, white, and refinery red.  Aside from nighttime black, each color is a regional allusion:  \"imperial blue\" for the Sugar Land\u2013based [[Imperial Sugar]] company, \"rawhide yellow\" for the cattle industry, and \"refinery red\" for the area's oil refineries.  The team's primary logo consists of a mosquito flying over a Texas contour with its proboscis marking [[Fort Bend County, Texas|Fort Bend County]] which is located in the Southeast Texas area.  The \"Skeeters\" wordmark centered below is made up of sugarcane-inspired lettering - a reference to the industry's importance to the region.  Centered to the right above the contour is \"Sugar Land\" in black letters with a \"lone star.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/ballparkbiz.wordpress.com\/2010\/12\/01\/its-the-sugar-land-skeeters\/ |title=It\u2019s the \u2018Sugar Land Skeeters\u2019 |publisher=Ballparkbiz.wordpress.com |date=2010-12-01 |accessdate=2011-04-24}}<\/ref>\n\n== Season-by-Season record ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"5\"  style=\"background:#0047AB; color:white;\"|Sugar Land Skeeters\n|-\n!

The park was established by royal decree on 25 October 1991, and then in 1998, it was enlarged to the northwest.  The park now covers {{convert|1310|km2}}, with the glaciers covering about {{convert|800|km2}} of the park.\n\n==Location==\nThe park lies in the [[municipalities of Norway|municipalities]] of [[Luster, Norway|Luster]], [[Balestrand]], [[J\u00f8lster]], [[Sogndal]], [[Gloppen]], [[F\u00f8rde]], and [[Stryn]], all of which are in [[Sogn og Fjordane]] [[counties of Norway|county]].  \nThere are three museums and also visitors centers: the [[Breheimsenteret]] in [[Jostedal]], [[Jostedalsbreen nasjonalparksenter]] in Oppstryn ([[Stryn]]) and [[Norwegian Glacier Museum|Norsk bremuseum]] in [[Fj\u00e6rland]].\n\n==Topography==\nThe highest peak in the park is [[Lodalsk\u00e5pa]] at {{convert|2083|m}}. The glacier's highest point, [[Brenibba]], lies {{convert|2018|m}} above sea level while its lowest point is {{convert|350|m}} above sea level.  The glacier has shrunk in recent years, and there are ruins of farms that were overtaken by the glacier in 1750.<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.snl.no\/Jostedalsbreen_nasjonalpark|title=Jostedalsbreen nasjonalpark|author=Store norske leksikon|authorlink=Store norske leksikon|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2010-07-24}}<\/ref>\n\n==Name==\nThe park was named after the main glacier in it, Jostedalsbreen.

[[Environmental issues with the Three Gorges Dam]] has recently been spun off from [[Three Gorges Dam]] and it seems editors have got caught up with the negative aspects again, ignoring some positive environmental benefits of dams.  Would you care to take a look at it please, with NPOV in mind... thanks, [[User:Johnfos|Johnfos]] ([[User talk:Johnfos|talk]]) 06:11, 26 February 2008 (UTC)\n\n== Writing for the ''Signpost'' ==\n\nHello.  You expressed interest in writing for the [[WP:POST|''Wikipedia Signpost'']] (sorry for the delay in responding).  I'm sending this message to everyone who commented, so if you have any questions I haven't answered, please feel free to [[User talk:Ral315|ask me]], and I'll try to respond to specific questions.\n\nEssentially, what I'm looking for is writers who can step in and write on subjects that are newsworthy from week-to-week.  The content of the stories obviously varies each week depending on what's happening; this is discussed below.\n\nThere are three major parts to writing an article:\n\n# Choosing a topic\n# Writing the article\n# Submitting the article\n\n=== Part 1:  Choosing a topic ===\n\nAs said above, topics will vary from week-to-week.  For this week, these particular issues may be newsworthy:\n\n* '''<s>Bureaucratship candidacies<\/s>''' &mdash; There are a lot of bureaucratship candidacies this week, for the first time in about six or seven months.  I'm personally covering this one for next week, but this is a good example of what might be newsworthy.\n* '''Encyclopedia of Life''' &mdash; This encyclopedia of species has been getting some press, and relates somewhat to Wikimedia project [[Wikispecies]].\n* '''Hidden categories''' &mdash; For those technically inclined, this is a new feature that has some interesting implications.\n\nFor more ideas, and for ideas in the future, check [[WP:POST\/N\/S|the tip-line]] -- there are usually some good ideas there.\n\nOnce you've decided on a topic, make sure to sign up for it [[WP:POST\/N\/O|in the newsroom]], under \"Special stories\", so that users aren't duplicating each others' work (though multiple writers are certainly free to work together on a story).\n\n=== Part 2:  Writing the article ===\n\nNow, you've decided on a topic and signed up for it.  To write it, create a subpage in your userspace.  For my story this week on the bureaucratship candidacies, for example, I'll create it at [[User:Ral315\/Bureaucratship candidacies]].  The name isn't a big deal, of course -- I'll change it if necessary.\n\nFormatting the story isn't important; for your first article, you should mainly focus on writing a good story, and I'll take care of the formatting when we publish.  Try to write it in a newspaper-like tone, avoiding personal comments and opinions in favor of straight-forward facts.  The size of an article varies based on what the story is, but a good minimum goal for ''most stories'' is two-to-three good paragraphs.  Longer articles are even better, so long as they're well-written.\n\n=== Part 3:  Submitting the article ===\n\nNow, all you have to do is post a link to the article [[WP:POST\/N\/O|in the newsroom]], where you signed up for it earlier.  That's it!  You're done!\n\nAgain, if you have any questions at all, please contact me, and I'll try to respond as soon as possible.\n\nThanks for your interest in writing for the ''Signpost''.

Have you seen the Talk page of this one?  Classic case of a POV fork if I ever saw one.  Alan seems to have created many \"Environmental issues in xxx\" categories and has split articles to fill them up... [[User:Johnfos|Johnfos]] ([[User talk:Johnfos|talk]]) 03:13, 25 March 2008 (UTC)\n:Yes, it's people like this who make the rest of us involuntarily grab for the bridges of our noses.  Apparently Alan is another of the editors who read [[WP:BOLD]] and assume a ''\"veni, vidi, vici\"'' mentality.  We need a new essay: [[WP:NOT_ROME]].  I hope we can convince him to stop soon; he's headed to no good end.  '''Fl\u00e9\u00ea\u0165fl\u00e4m\u1ebd''' <small> [[User:Fleetflame|U]]-[[User_talk:Fleetflame|T]]-[[Special:Contributions\/Fleetflame|C]] <\/small> 20:27, 25 March 2008 (UTC)\n\n::I take issue with your comments and that I am \"conquering\" WP. My splitting of articles to improve WP and a difference of opinion between us should not be interpreted by you as my conquering of WP.  If you go through my edits you will realise that I have been very cooperative with WP editors. -- [[User:Alan Liefting|Alan Liefting]]- (<small>[[User_talk:Alan_Liefting|talk]]<\/small>) - 21:48, 27 March 2008 (UTC)\n\n:Do you realise that there were many \"Environmental issues in XXXX\" '''articles''' before I started creating '''categories''' for them? I split out two or three env issue articles and it seems to be an issue (he-he!!!) with you. What about all the existing env issues article I did not have a hand in?  This is not some sort of personal vendetta is it?-- [[User:Alan Liefting|Alan Liefting]]- (<small>[[User_talk:Alan_Liefting|talk]]<\/small>) - 21:48, 27 March 2008 (UTC)\n\nI guess you're right: there is only so much we can say, and then it is ultimately up to Alan to choose to be more co-operative if he wants.  It's interesting that some old-school environmentalists don't place a lot of emphasis on people issues, and are all caught up with feathers, fur, and fins.  And that such environmentalists are often full of doom and gloom, and say little about more contemporary messages associated with sustainability etc.  I read a book recently that gave much food for thought about future directions: [[The Clean Tech Revolution]]. [[User:Johnfos|Johnfos]] ([[User talk:Johnfos|talk]]) 05:23, 27 March 2008 (UTC)\n::Well, this article may be a special case--the issues aren't really covered in the main article and I don't see that it was truly split.  I do realize that doesn't mean it's not a fork, but this ''may'' be notable enough for its own article.  I've asked for a pov check from someone else because I can't decide.  :-)  '''Fl\u00e9\u00ea\u0165fl\u00e4m\u1ebd''' <small> [[User:Fleetflame|U]]-[[User_talk:Fleetflame|T]]-[[Special:Contributions\/Fleetflame|C]] <\/small> 16:05, 27 March 2008 (UTC)\n\n:What makes you say that I am not being cooperative.  I have discussed the issues on the talk pages I have not reverted any of your edits. If you both feel strongly about my article splits why not revert them? Also, you seem to be speculating about me and I suspect it is based on very little research on my actions. -- [[User:Alan Liefting|Alan Liefting]]- (<small>[[User_talk:Alan_Liefting|talk]]<\/small>) - 21:48, 27 March 2008 (UTC)\n\n::Don't make me laugh, Alan.  You provide next to no info about yourself on your user page, then express surprise that people are speculating about you.  You have split many articles without discussion and then express surprise that people are saying you are not co-operative. Don't make me laugh! [[User:Johnfos|Johnfos]] ([[User talk:Johnfos|talk]]) 01:50, 28 March 2008 (UTC)\n\n:::There is no obligation to supply information about me on my user page and if I did so I may well be judged by it. Please judge me on my edits rather than your speculations. Anyway, WP is not about personal stuff. With splitting articles, there is no policy or guideline to say that it must be discussed first. And why do you say I have split \"many\" articles? Since I abide by policy and guidelines, since I do not revert other editors work back to mine (unless it is vandalism), since I do regularly discuss things on talk pages, since I am part of WikiProjects and since I do help out with such mundane tasks as redlink recovery, categorisation, disambiguation pages, vandal patrol etc I feel that I am cooperating quite well in the WP community. -- [[User:Alan Liefting|Alan Liefting]]- (<small>[[User_talk:Alan_Liefting|talk]]<\/small>) - 02:56, 28 March 2008 (UTC)\nWow, Alan, three edits in one minute! ;-) Please believe me: this is not a personal issue and your personal level of worth to Wikipedia is much less in question than your splitting of articles.  I realize there are several \"environmental issues\" articles and that is exactly what the problem is--I don't think we need more.  I believe you misinterpreted [[WP:BOLD]] because you cited it as the reason you split an article (a process that traditionally requires consensus) and violated [[WP:CFORK]] while doing it.  Also, I am not simply reverting your edits for the same reason you are not reverting mine.  I am not trying to assume I know better than anyone else or act highhandedly, I just do not understand why you keep splitting these sections out into articles.  '''Fl\u00e9\u00ea\u0165fl\u00e4m\u1ebd''' <small> [[User:Fleetflame|U]]-[[User_talk:Fleetflame|T]]-[[Special:Contributions\/Fleetflame|C]] <\/small> 01:05, 29 March 2008 (UTC)\n\n:I may be [[WP:BOLD]] (occasionally) but I am not reckless and I respect [[WP:CONS|consensus]]. With splitting articles there is nothing in policy or guidelines that I can find that says I must seek consensus '''before''' the split. A recommendation can of course be made using the <tt>{{[[Template:Split|split]]}}<\/tt> tag if there  may be doubts about the suitability of a split. Splitting articles is an inevitable process as the size of articles increases. Also, as pointed out elsewhere, you have not interpreted [[WP:CFORK]] correctly. The split is neither similar content nor POV. You may '''perceive''' it as a POV split but I doubt that any others see it as such which is why we need to get a consensus from at least a few more editors. I cannot see why you think WP does not need more environmental issues articled. Given the importance, the level of interest in environmental matters and the 2.3 million articled WP currently has I would arge that there are insufficient articles of this type. -- [[User:Alan Liefting|Alan Liefting]]- (<small>[[User_talk:Alan_Liefting|talk]]<\/small>) - 05:32, 29 March 2008 (UTC)\n::So now the reason you're splitting articles is \"''we don't have enough of them''\"?  Alan, as I pointed out already, splitting may not ''require'' consensus but it is a process that ''traditionally'' only happens after discussion.  I'm willing to get more editor's thoughts on this issue; I believe we need to bring it to a head quickly.  Perhaps this could be submitted to 3O or the Mediation Cabal.  Let me know what you think.  '''Fl\u00e9\u00ea\u0165fl\u00e4m\u1ebd''' <small> [[User:Fleetflame|U]]-[[User_talk:Fleetflame|T]]-[[Special:Contributions\/Fleetflame|C]] <\/small> 00:12, 31 March 2008 (UTC)\n\n:::Can you point me to this WP [[tradition]]? The last thing I expect WP to have is any sort of [[tradition]]. We have [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines|policy and guidelines]] but I know of know of no [[tradition]]s apart from those in the [[Wikipedia:miscellany for deletion\/Wikipedia:Catholic Church of Wikipedia|Church of Wikipedia]]!! If an article is in obvious need of splitting I would do it without discussion. If I cannot do it to the WP standard or if it MAY be contentious I would place the <nowiki>{{split}}<\/nowiki> tag on it. Things that are not contentious and fit it with WP need not be discussed. I am not only splitting articles because \"''we don't have enough of them''\". My first reason for splitting articles is because it is needed due to a section of an article being given too much space and thus upsetting the balance of the topic. Other reasons are: to fit it in with categorisation, or because it is notable enough to justify its own article or because a red link exists for it (which means someone else thinks it is important). Yes, it would be good to involve other editors in order to move on from this stalemate but I don't see what the hurry is. Out of interest are you aware of [[:Category:Articles to be split]]? -- [[User:Alan Liefting|Alan Liefting]]- (<small>[[User_talk:Alan_Liefting|talk]]<\/small>) - 03:53, 31 March 2008 (UTC)\nAlan, so far the reasons you have given for splitting articles have been:\n#The original articles are too long\n#The issues of ''these'' environmental impacts are notable, somehow more than others of the same kind\n#I created the category!\n#Someone put a redlink in some article pointing to it\n#We need more \"environmental issues\" articles\n#[[WP:BOLD]]\n#I have a \"splittist\" opinion\nYour reasoning for the rather heated debate are:\n#You guys just hate me anyway\n#We have a different \"philosophical outlook\" (my personal favorite)\n#You just don't like the negative aspects of dams\n#I'm siding with the Siberian Crane and the Baiji\nIf you cannot come up with better arguments than these for creating an obvious [[WP:CFORK|content fork]] (yes, that annoying little guideline again), than please consider not splitting any more articles until we can reach a general consensus on the issue.  The reason I would like to see this resolved quickly is that I believe having articles like this cheapens Wikipedia's integrity for readers and I believe it should be removed as soon as possible.  '''Fl\u00e9\u00ea\u0165fl\u00e4m\u1ebd''' <small> [[User:Fleetflame|U]]-[[User_talk:Fleetflame|T]]-[[Special:Contributions\/Fleetflame|C]] <\/small> 00:31, 1 April 2008 (UTC)\n\n:I don't see sign of a heated debate, all I see is a difference in opinion. If you are getting heated about it I see no evidence of it. Also, please do not twist my comments to make your view seem a better option. In order of priority (very roughly) my reasons for spitting the article is:\n#a section of an article being given too much space\n#it is as a notable issue as the main article so an article should exist\n#the original articles are starting to get too long\n#a category exists and could do with populating\n#a red link exists for it suggesting others see the need for an article\n#given the size of WP there does seem to be a need for more more env issue article given the importance and level of interest in such matters. (there is a [[List of Pokemon characters]] and all sorts of [[Wikipedia:Unusual articles|unusual articles ]] so why can't I have my articles. :-) )\n\n:(see a few differences?!?)\n:I see no point in answering to your '''assumed''' reasoning for the \"heated debate\" - that is bordering on [[WP:CIVIL|incivility]]. We are trying to create an encyclopaedia here not trying to delve into other peoples motivation. We do really need a wider range of opinion here since this discussion is getting nowhere. Your concern about my article splits as cheaping WP are totally out of proportion with the other problems with WP. Overt, and more importantly, covert vandalism is by for the biggest problem WP faces in terms of \"cheapening\" the project. And you seem to be concerned about two or three article I created by splitting them for the existing article! You need to get things into perspective.  I made no change to content. If they were NPOV in the orig article then they should be NPOV in the new article. You are misinterpreting [[WP:CFORK]]. I will carry on splitting articles regardless of your wishes and I will monitor any feedback on these splits (as I do with most of my major edits). If I find that my editing proves to be unacceptable by others I will review my editing style. -- [[User:Alan Liefting|Alan Liefting]]- (<small>[[User_talk:Alan_Liefting|talk]]<\/small>) - 01:18, 1 April 2008 (UTC)\n::Alan, don't be ridiculous.  I do believe, as I said, that having articles that do not adhere to npov does cheapen Wikipedia's integrity.  I ''did not'' say that I thought it did so more than vandalism did.  Don't tell me to get my priorities straight when the only reason they were out of order was your radically misinterpreting my comment.  I also have helped on vandal patrol (although admittedly I do less of that lately) and Newpage Patrol, so I know just as well as you how vandalism effects Wikipedia.  Also, you keep saying that I misinterpreted [[WP:CFORK]].  Will you please show me how?  To the best of my knowledge I have not.  You, on the other hand, have shown you do not understand [[WP:NPOV|npov]] when you said [[Talk:Environmental issues with the Three Gorges Dam|here]], \"''It is POV if the '''content''' not the '''article name''' is POV''.\"  Now compare that with [[Wikipedia:Npov#Article_naming|this paragraph]].  If you do not understand npov, you have no grounds to say this article does not violate it.  Finally, you recently said, \"''If I find that my editing proves to be unacceptable by others I will review my editing style,''\" yet in the sentence before that you said, \"''I will carry on splitting articles regardless of your wishes...''\"  How, while taking that mentality and contradicting yourself meanwhile, can you defend yourself as someone who does not run into edit conflicts or arguments about your actions?

You probably got that much.  Obviously, it's a problem that we have two different articles about the same person - one of them needs to [[WP:R|redirect]] to the other.  Because of Wikipedia's naming conventions and the fact that the other article (not yours) was there first, [[Jarnovic]] should simply redirect to [[Ivan Mane Jarnovi\u0107]].

At the end of World War II, I believe he would also have even been a possible Councillor of State, given the low number of adult royals (when he turned 21 in 1945, the adult royals ahead of him in succession were his uncle the Duke of Gloucester, his mother, and his older brother, which I believe would have made him a councillor of state until Elizabeth came of age in 1947.)

It has been described in a media release as \"John Safran's most audacious project yet\". It had a much more serious tone than Safran's previous work ''[[Music Jamboree]]''. The show was released by Ghost of Your Ex-Boyfriend Productions and [[SBS Independent]], was co-written with Mark O'Toole, directed by [[Craig Melville]], and produced by [[Richard Lowenstein]], [[Selin Yaman]] and [[Ghost Pictures]]. The production team was known as Ghost of Your Ex-Boyfriend Productions, an amalgamation of John Safran's Ex-Boyfriend Productions, and Richard Lowenstein's Ghost Productions. The series won the 2005 [[Australian Film Institute Awards|Australian Film Institute Award]] for Best Comedy Series.\n\nThe show's opening theme is ''Hate Priest'' by the band [[Mozart on Crack]]. The opening sequence features John in a black suit breaking out of a patch of black scorched earth with his bare hands during a thunderstorm. The words \"when the thousand years are over Satan will be released from his prison\" are spoken in a low pseudo-ominous voice.\n\n== Episode guide ==          <!--each episode had a one word title - akin to \"Forgiveness\", \"Meditation\", hence the '-' scattered in titles-->\n\n=== Episode one ===\n* In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], Safran meets [[Sheikh Omar Bakri]] and [[Sheikh Abu Hamza]] and succeeds in getting a [[fatwa]] placed on [[Rove McManus]] for dropping John's scheduled appearance on [[Rove (TV series)|Rove Live]].  The fatwa was later removed from McManus.\n* Safran tries out a religion based on hallucinogenic cactus plant, [[Peyote]]; [[vomiting]] and weak [[hallucination]]s ensue\n* Safran examines [[Scientology]] at the expense of [[Jamie Packer]] and the [[Nine Network]]\n\n=== Episode two ===\n* Safran looks at the duplicity of Australia's \"[[National Sorry Day|Sorry]]\" attitude to [[Australian Aborigine|Indigenous Rights]]\n* Safran tries out [[zen Buddhism]] in [[Japan]], the segment includes two incidents of Safran being beaten with a stick as punishment for mistakes made with meditation and philosophical questions\n* Safran examines the link between [[Satanism]] and [[Freemasons|Freemasonry]]\n\n=== Episode three ===\n* Despite being [[Judaism|Jewish]], Safran attempts to join a branch of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in [[California]]\n* Safran tries out [[Catholic]]ism under the guidance of [[Father Bob Maguire]]\n* Safran holds a competition in which Australian-[[Palestinians]] vie for his [[Israel]]i citizenship by recreating segments from ''Music Jamboree''\n\n=== Episode four ===\n* Safran examines [[LDS cinema|Mormon cinema]] in [[Salt Lake City]], proposing his \"Extreme Mormons\" film\n* Safran tries out [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] in [[Haiti]], participating in the \"[[Day of the Dead]]\" ceremony\n* John visits a [[Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership|Jewish gun advocate]] and [[rabbi]] in [[Los Angeles]], in a bid to show that [[Gun politics in the US|American gun rights activists]] consist of more than [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christians]]\n\nThe Vodou segment was graphic, featuring the TV crew being attacked, [[spiritual possession]], and a goat having its [[testicles]] bitten off and its throat slit.\n\n=== Episode five ===\n* John travels to [[Sicily]] to confess to a [[priest]] that he stole some batteries and [[masturbation|masturbated]] in a bed owned by the priest during ''[[Race Around the World]]''\n* Again in Salt Lake City, Safran tries some [[atheism|atheistic]] door knocking to harass local Mormons\n* In [[India]], Safran tries out the spiritual teachings of several [[Hindu]] [[guru]]s\n\n=== Episode six ===\n* John [[audition]]s for the [[Harlem Gospel Choir]] with a tuneless rendition of [[Amazing Grace]]\n* John tries out [[\u00c1satr\u00fa in the United States|\u00c1satr\u00fa]] (\"the [[Viking]] [[religion]]\") taking part in a remembrance ceremony in the [[United States]]\n* [[Big Brother (Australian TV series)|Big Brother]] series one contestant [[Sara-Marie Fedele]] helps Safran attempt to broker [[peace]] between Australian representatives of both sides of the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]].\n* Inspired by [[rumour]]s in [[Malawi]] John confronts [[:Category:Australian politicians|Australian politicians]] in [[Canberra]] to try and discover if any are [[vampire]]s\n\nThe only politician who was found to be a so-called \"vampire\" was [[Kevin Rudd]] who would later become [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]].\n\n=== Episode seven ===\n* John travels to [[Mozambique]] to lift a curse from the [[Australia national football team|Socceroos]] at the behest of [[association football|football]] legend [[Johnny Warren]]\n* Again in Salt Lake City, Safran finds out what is so special about \"[[Temple garment (Mormonism)|Mormon underwear]]\"\n* With the help of [[Canberra]] [[mathematician]] [[Brendan McKay]], John uncovers the link between ''[[The Bible Code]]'', [[September 11, 2001]] and [[rapping|rapper]] [[Vanilla Ice]]\n* John examines the realistic goals of religious [[boycott]]s\n\n=== Episode eight ===\nThe eighth episode was the most controversial. Instead of its usual format of various segments, the show featured a single story: the [[exorcism]] of John's [[demon]]s by [[Christian]] exorcist and fundamentalist [[preacher]] [[Bob Larson]]. There was none of the humour that characterised the preceding episodes. The exorcism was dramatic and realistic and no explanation was given at the end of the episode as to John's behaviour. On the [[Yahoo!]] \"[http:\/\/groups.yahoo.com\/group\/Cult_of_Safran\/ Cult of Safran]\" web group a stormy discussion started on whether John was actually faking - Safran's lisp is absent while allegedly possessed. Safran appeared in several [[radio]] and [[television]] plug spots for the show post-production\/pre-screening and only briefly commented on the exorcism episode as a very intense segment to film. After the screening of the episode Safran appeared in an interview on [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] radio and said he didn't remember a lot of the experience. The sales pitch for the recently released DVD is \"you've seen the exorcism, now buy the DVD\".\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Australian television series]]\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0423675|title=John Safran vs. God}}\n* ''[http:\/\/www.abc.net.au\/rn\/relig\/spirit\/stories\/s1193306.htm John Safran vs The Spirit of Things]'' &mdash; 12 September 2004 interview with [[Rachael Kohn]] on [[Radio National]]'s '''[[The Spirit of Things]]''' program\n\n{{AACTA Award for Best Television Comedy Series}}\n\n[[Category:Australian documentary television series]]\n[[Category:Religious television series]]\n[[Category:Special Broadcasting Service shows]]\n[[Category:Australian comedy television series]]\n[[Category:Satirical television programmes]]\n[[Category:2004 Australian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2004 Australian television series endings]]\n[[Category:2000s Australian television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programming]]","timestamp":"20160410105232","user-timestamp":"20150410105232"},{"title":"Talk:Ludwika J\u0119drzejewicz","content":"{{WikiProject Classical}}","timestamp":"20160410105233","user-timestamp":"20150410105233"},{"title":"User:Erynspiration\/Time Timer","content":"","timestamp":"20160410105233","user-timestamp":"20150410105233"},{"title":"Category:1710s disestablishments in the Holy Roman Empire","content":"{{DisestcatCountryDecade|17|1|18th|the Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Empire}}\n\n[[Category:1710s disestablishments in Europe|Holy Roman Empire]]","timestamp":"20160410105234","user-timestamp":"20150410105234"},{"title":"Talk:Qatif and Dammam mosque bombings","content":"{{Talk header}}\n{{WikiProject banner shell|collapsed=yes|1=\n{{WikiProject Saudi Arabia|class=Start |importance=}}\n{{WikiProject Arab world|class=Start |importance=Low}}\n{{WikiProject Terrorism|class=Start |importance=}}\n{{WikiProject Islam|class=Start |importance= |Islam-and-Controversy=}}\n}}\n{{ITN talk|24 May|2015}}\n\n==Untitled==\nIn view of objection over tone of the page, contents of the page have accordingly modified to satisfy the WP:NPOV.

It drains an area of the [[Edwards Plateau]], flowing west to east across the [[Texas Hill Country]] west of [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. The name \"Pedernales\", first used in the middle 18th century, comes from a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for the [[flint]] rocks characteristic of the riverbed.\n\n==Description==\nThe river rises from springs in southeastern [[Kimble County, Texas|Kimble County]], approximately {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} southeast of [[Junction, Texas|Junction]].  It flows generally east into [[Gillespie County, Texas|Gillespie County]], past [[Fredericksburg, Texas|Fredericksburg]], and into [[Blanco County, Texas|Blanco County]], passing north of [[Johnson City, Texas|Johnson City]]. It joins the Colorado from the southwest in [[Lake Travis]], approximately {{convert|10|mi|km|0}} west of Austin.\n\nThe river has a close association with the Texas Hill Country, tied to the history of the region and emblematic of its geography. Along its route it flows over numerous rugged [[limestone]] escarpments as it winds eastward, passing along the south side of the ranch of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]],<ref>http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/lyjo\/planyourvisit\/upload\/Locator2008-nobus.pdf<\/ref> who grew up in nearby [[Stonewall, Texas|Stonewall]], south of the river.\n\nIn 1750, [[Fray Benito Fern\u00e1ndez de Santa Ana]] proposed a plan to the [[Spain|Spanish]] government that a mission be established among the [[Lipan Apache people|Lipan Apache]] who lived along the river. In 1789, the river was the site of a skirmish between Colonel [[Francisco Xavier Ugalde]] and a group of Lipan and [[Mescalero]] Indians. The first permanent white settlement along the river was in 1846, when the town of Fredericksburg was established by [[Germany|German]] immigrants. The threat of raids from Apaches restricted settlement in the area until the 1880s.\n\n[[Pedernales Falls State Park]] is located along the river in Blanco County east of Johnson City. Like many rivers in central Texas, it is prone to variable water levels. A sign at the state park shows a relatively tranquil river in one picture and a raging wall of muddy water in the next picture, said to be taken only five minutes after the first. The speed at which [[flash floods]] can arise along this river has resulted in several deaths at the park, and warning sirens have been installed in the park and elsewhere along the river. The lower river is a popular destination for [[whitewater rafting]] during the high-water season.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Texas rivers]]\n*[[Llano River]]\n*[[Frio River]]\n*[[Brazos River]]\n*[[Colorado River (Texas)]]\n*[[White River (Texas)]]\n*[[Pecos River]]\n*[[Rio Grande]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http:\/\/www.tpwd.state.tx.us\/spdest\/findadest\/parks\/pedernales_falls\/ Pedernales Falls State Park]\n*[http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/lyjo\/ NPS: Lyndon B.

Also, it doesn't note that IFTU no longer even uses the same name \u2013 it now goes by the General Federation of Iraqi Workers after merger with several other unions. (The article title should be changed to reflect this.) I believe this has been the case since 2005, making this article highly outdated. I'll clean this up at some point, but I don't know when that will be, so if somebody wants to take care of it sooner, by all means, go for it.

Her symbol is a dolphin with a calf.\n\n==Publication history==\nTrishina was first detailed in the book ''[[Monster Mythology]]'' (1992), including details about her priesthood.<ref>[[Carl Sargent|Sargent, Carl]]. ''[[Monster Mythology]]'' (TSR, 1992)<\/ref>\n\n==Description==\nTrishina appears, variously, as a female dolphin or as a pretty young [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|aquatic elf]]. She uses direct telepathic communications to her priests rather than relying on obscure omens.\n\n==Relationships==\nTrishina is usually depicted as the consort of [[Deep Sashelas]], and thus an honorary member of the [[Seldarine]]. She is also a member of the [[asathalfinare]].\n\nTrishina works closely with her consort.\n\n==Realm==\nTrishina divides most of her time between [[Elysium (Dungeons & Dragons)|Elysium]] and the [[Mount Celestia|Seven Heavens]]. She has a region in the oceanic fourth layer of Elysium, Thalasia, that she sets aside for the spirits of dolphins who have died defending their young.\n\nTrishina's husband Deep Sashelas dwells on the plane of [[Arborea (Dungeons & Dragons)|Arborea]], in the realm of ''Elavandor'', but this is not listed as one of Trishina's abodes.\n\n==Dogma==\nTrishina is more pacifistic than Deep Sashelas, more inclined to help those in need, and more convinced that redemption is possible for those of evil ilk. She will send avatars to help and heal dolphins or sea elves in peril. Sometimes she will even aid shipwrecked humans.\n\nBecause of Trishina's ties to Deep Sashelas, dolphins will aid sea elves in their wars against the [[koalinth]]s.\n\n==Worshippers==\nTrishina is worshipped by dolphins and [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|aquatic elves]].\n\n===Clergy===\nPriests of Trishina are pacifists unless they need to fight in order to protect their young. In such cases, they fight fiercely and will willingly give their lives. Trishina's clerics must aid dolphins, sea elves, or other non-evil creatures in distress. Older priests are always held in respect.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{D&D topics}}\n\n[[Category:Dungeons & Dragons deities]]\n[[Category:Greyhawk deities]]\n\n{{Greyhawk-stub}}\n{{D&D-char-stub}}","timestamp":"20160410105238","user-timestamp":"20150410105238"},{"title":"Talk:Magadan (icebreaker)","content":"{{WikiProject Ships|class=Stub|importance=Mid}}\n\n==image==\nI am removing the image -- I was mistaken by it's original caption.

Many of their products are sold throughout [[Asia]] and have become extremely popular in households Australia-wide due to their durability and availability.\n\n== History ==\nMartin Selley established the Selleys Chemical Company after he left Germany for Australia in 1939. He had a formula for wood Putty which he and his wife mixed up in the laundry sink and sold to hardware stores and glaziers. He then launched two more products, Selleys Metallic Cement, and Selleys Unifix, which are still available today, as is the Wood Putty. The huge success of the company was slow to arrive, but as DIY became more popular, the Selleys product range expanded to meet demands, and eventually Selleys were selling adhesives, sealants and much more, and the Selley's slogan, \"If it's Selleys, it works,\" ( which was conceived in the lounge room of Doug Stewart at 45 Goodwin Tce. Moorooka, Brisbane) became recognised by most people.Doug Stewart (Chief Consultant and Rep for Selleys in Queensland from 1959 to 1977) was sent to Sydney to oversee the use of Selleys Unifix to secure the tiles on the Sails of the Sydney Opera House during construction.\n\nSelleys is now a subsidiary of [[Dulux]]Group, an Australian listed company on the S&P\/ASX 200.\n\n==External links==\n* [http:\/\/www.selleys.com.au\/ Selleys]\n* [http:\/\/www.duluxgroup.com.au\/ DuluxGroup]\n\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies of Australia]]\n\n{{australia-company-stub}}","timestamp":"20160410105243","user-timestamp":"20160410004706"},{"title":"Talk:Renate Jansen","content":"{{WikiProjectBannerShell|1=\n{{WikiProject Biography|living=yes|class=stub|sports-work-group=yes|sports-priority=low|listas=Jansen, Renate}}\n{{WikiProject Football|class=stub|Netherlands=yes|Women=yes}}\n{{WikiProject Netherlands| class=stub}}\n{{WikiProject Women's sport}}\n| blp=yes\n}}","timestamp":"20160410105243","user-timestamp":"20160410003835"},{"title":"User:Ecthelion83","content":"{{Userboxtop | Ecthelion83's Boxes}}\n{{User Korean}}\n{{User WPKorea}}\n{{user:Blast san\/userboxes\/User IQ|142}}\n{{user ko}}\n{{user en}}\n{{user de-3}}\n{{user ru-1}}\n{{User Northwestern}}\n{{user Mensa}}\n{{User degree in|biomedical engineering}}\n{{Userbox |border-c=#4682B4 |border-s=3 |id-c=#fff |id-s=6 |id-fc=#000 |info-c=#FFFFFF |info-s=9 |info-fc=#4169E1 |id=[[Image:Muse_Wikibox_graphic.PNG]] |info=This user loves '''[[Muse]]'''.}}\n{{User:BrokenSphere\/Userboxes\/RATM}}\n{{user violin}}\n{{user piano}}\n{{User:UBX\/National Defense Service Medal}}\n{{Userbox |border-c=#FF0000 |border-s=2 |id-c=#fff |id-s=6 |id-fc=#000 |info-c=#FFFF00 |info-s=8 |info-fc=#FF0000 |id=[[Image:USMC_Good_Conduct_Medal_ribbon.PNG]] |info=This has been awarded the '''[[Marine Corps]] Good Conduct Medal'''.}}\n{{Userboxbottom}}\n\n== About Me ==\n\nEcthelion is a [[handle]] I have used, and I got it from the [[Lord of the Rings]] trilogy.\n\nI was born in [[South Korea]] but I grew up in the [[United States]].\n\nUm, what the hell else can I put in here before it turns into a [[Facebook]] or [[MySpace]] profile?\nLet's see: I am a recent graduate of [[Northwestern University]], earned my [[B.S.]] in [[biomedical engineering]] there, but I probably should have been a political science\/history\/English triple major instead (as I seem to have more enthusiasm for topics in those fields and probably would have more aptitude in classes thereof, not that I don't have any in engineering - I do). I have completed my MPH (that's master of [[public health]]) at the [[University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey]] (I'm not from Jersey; long story involved as to how I got here), and served as the president of the student government there for one school year. After a one-semester stint at [[St. George's University]] School of Medicine, I had to return home for a variety of reasons, and am currently pursuing my doctorate in the Ph.D. program in epidemiology at [[Michigan State University]]. I do intend to return to medical school upon the completion of my doctorate, be it St. George's or another accredited institution (St. George's does not allow for leaves of absence of longer than a semester, and I would have to re-start at the very beginning if I were to return).\n\nI play the [[piano]] and [[violin]], I [[ski]], I play [[tennis]], I sometimes play golf (but I suck at that), I'm a black belt in [[taekwondo]], and I practice [[kendo]] as well. I used to run regularly, but since I started getting [[shin splints]], I have taken up [[swimming]] (I used to be on my high school swimming team) instead. I do cook sometimes (but it's such a pain in the ass). While I am pretty well-read, I still have a voracious appetite for books, especially ones that require lots of thinking during and after the reading.\n\nThis piece of trivia may be useless to some, but useful for others: I used to be on the chess team in junior high school, and at my peak performance then, I defeated my coach in an after-school match. It only happened once though, and it occurred by some slick diversionary conversation on my part, not through any feat of skill (and my coach was gracious enough to just let me have the win).\n\nI used to be a [[United States Marine]] reservist while an undergrad at Northwestern, but because of conflicts between the reserves and school, I requested and received a general discharge.\n\nI am [[Roman Catholic]].\n\nI like [[Korean food]], but I am not averse to other foods, ethnic or otherwise. I especially like [[Chipotl\u00e9]] (it is my most favorite restaurant, franchised or not; and I am well-aware that it doesn't exactly qualify as \"ethnic\" food ''per se'').\n\nMy father is descended from the [[Korean]] [[Lee_(Korean_name) | Lees]] of [[Gyeongju]] (\uacbd\uc8fc \uc774 \uc528), and my mother is descended from the Korean [[Kim_(Korean_name) | Kims]] of [[Gimhae]] (\uae40\ud574 \uae40 \uc528). According to my [[jokbo]] (\uc871\ubcf4) or family genealogic record, I am of the 41st generation of my branch (\uc775\uc81c\uacf5 \ud30c) of the Gyeongju Lees.\n\nCurrently, I teach the [[MCAT]], [[PCAT]], [[GRE]], and [[GMAT]] for [[Kaplan, Inc. | Kaplan]], which I like to call the \"evil empire of the test prep industry.\" All joking aside, it's a pretty good job for a student; anyone who can score at or above the 90th percentile on a standardized exam (that's Kaplan's cutoff; I scored in the 93rd percentile, a 34R, on my MCAT, and on the 99th percentile, a 450, on the PCAT - my GRE score breaks down as 790 quantitative, 690 verbal, and 6.0 writing, while the 730 on GMAT was a simulated score) has a pretty good shot at getting a teaching job with Kaplan. I also recently qualified on examinations to join the high-IQ society [[Mensa International|Mensa]].\n\nI'm a stickler for historical accuracy and correctness, but I don't care for political correctness because I feel that it skirts around the issues and doesn't face the real problems head-on. As a rather proud Korean, I might be partial to the Korean take on a lot of issues, but I am actually pretty fair and I know when the Korean take on something is inaccurate (which happens more often than you'd think, even if the inaccuracy is not due to bias).\n\nOh, for miscellaneous information, my favorite sports teams are as follows: the [[Chicago White Sox]], the [[Chicago Bears]]...and that about sums it up.\n\nI think I'm done with this.\n\n== Pages I've Created ==\n\n2015.06.18 [[Pavel Chernyshev]]<br>\n2012.06.18 [[Chinese standard movement]]<br>\n2009.02.14 [[White Army, Black Baron]]<br>\n2009.01.13 [[Armor of God]]<br>\n\nAs for pages to which I've contributed, it might be better to just look at the \"contribs\" link.

Gilchrist]], 1928\u201331. Best known as the former residence of [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell's Soup]]-heir John T. Dorrance, Jr., it is a contributing property in the [[Mill Creek Historic District (Bryn Mawr and Gladwyne, Pennsylvania)|Mill Creek Historic District]].\n\n==Dolobran II==\nGilchrist designed the estate for Rodman Ellison Griscom (1870\u20131944), a Philadelphia stockbroker and son of shipping magnate [[Clement Griscom]]. In the 1880s, the father had built a mansion and estate several miles away called [[Dolobran (Haverford, Pennsylvania)|\"Dolobran,\"]] and the son named his estate \"Dolobran II.\"\n\n===French Norman===\nInterest in [[Norman architecture|French-Norman architecture]] grew in the early 20th century, prompted by American architects who had attended the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris, and veterans of [[World War I]] who had served in Europe. Its greatest exponent in the Philadelphia area was architect [[George Howe (architect)|George Howe]], whose own mansion, \"[[High Hollow]]\" (1914\u201317), is a significant example of the style. The [[Architectural League of New York]] awarded Howe its 1925 Gold Medal for Excellence in Design for the French-Norman manor-and-farm, \"Laverock\" (1921\u201328, demolished),<ref>[http:\/\/www.american-architecture.info\/USA\/USA-Northeast\/NT-033.htm Laverock] from Society of Architectural Historians.<\/ref> in [[Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania]]. But, in an influential review in ''The New Republic'', critic [[Lewis Mumford]] denounced it as \"architectural anaesthesia\" and \"hocus-pocus\":<blockquote>\"''The critical weakness of the romantic architect is that he is employed in creating an environment into which people may escape from a sordid workaday world, whereas the real problem of architecture is to remake the workaday world so that people will not wish to escape from it.''\"<ref>Lewis Mumford, \"The Architecture of Escape,\" ''The New Republic'', vol. 43 (August 12, 1925).<\/ref><\/blockquote>\n\nGilchrist was best known for his [[Cotswold architecture|English-Cotswold-style]] suburban houses in the Philadelphia neighborhood of [[Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Chestnut Hill]]. He had made alterations to the elder Griscom's estate in 1905,<ref>[http:\/\/www.americanbuildings.org\/pab\/app\/pj_display.cfm\/42350 Griscom Residence] from Philadelphia Architects and Buildings.<\/ref> but the son's estate was the most ambitious single residence of his career. Gilchrist's \"Dolobran II\" can be seen as Howe's \"Laverock\" on an even grander scale &ndash; a late example of architecture as escapist fantasy.\n\n===Description===\nThe buildings are grouped around two courtyards, 400 feet apart, connected by a cobbled lane. The entrance courtyard is asymmetrical, and its buildings evoke a storybook French village. It is dominated by the corner turret of the caretaker's house, and also features a 10-car garage, a barn with horse stalls, a sheepfold, a staff cottage, and other service buildings. One turns onto the lane and glimpses the manor house through the narrow portal between the main courtyard's twin gatehouses.<ref>[http:\/\/lowermerionhistory.org\/photodb\/web\/html3\/098-1.html Former Dorrance Estate in Gladwyne] from Lower Merion Historical Society.<\/ref> A long greenhouse ran the length of the lane, until it was removed in the 1980s.\n\nThe main courtyard is a rigidly-symmetrical [[cour d'honneur|\"court of honor,\"]] with a two-and-a-half-story [[corps de logis|manor house]] to the south, and what seem to be one-and-a-half-story ancillary buildings to the east and west. These are actually wings of the house, connected by curving one-story corridors. The master bedroom wing to the west contains a two-bedroom suite and library, and the service wing to the east contains the kitchen and breakfast room, with servant rooms above. The manor house features three first-floor rooms \u2013 the entrance hall, living room and dining room \u2013 and three bedrooms above. The gatehouses provide five additional guest bedrooms.<ref>Morrison, p. 224.<\/ref>\n\nThe 67.5-acre grounds include formal gardens, orchards, pastures and woods, two swimming pools, a tennis court, a duck pond, and an [[aviary]] in the form of a turreted tower.\n\nThe estate was completed in 1931, at a reported cost of $700,000.<ref>John M.

In [[1999 in radio|1999]], the call letters were changed to WKLU, and the format evolved to a loose variant of [[classic rock]] - specializing in songs that most commercial radio stations didn't play, including songs from \"[[jam bands]].\" In [[2004 in radio|2004]] the Quinns sold the station to a [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] radio entrepreneur, Russ Oasis, who moved the tower to its current location and reformatted the station to a more commercially viable [[classic hits]] format. At midnight on December 4, 2007,  WKLU flipped to an oldies format based on the hits of the 60s and 70s.\n\nOn July 15, 2009; WKLU was sold by Russ Oasis (the stations former owner) to [[Educational Media Foundation]] and the station switched to [[K-LOVE]] ([[Contemporary Christian music|Contemporary Christian]]) on September 15, 2009. While the K-LOVE format is national, the station broadcasts public affairs programming for Brownsburg and Hendricks County on select Sunday nights. In addition, the WKLU studios are used for the K-LOVE morning show which is heard nationwide.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{FM station data|WKLU}}\n\n{{Indianapolis Radio}}\n{{K-LOVE}}\n\n{{coord|39.787|N|86.299|W|type:landmark_region:US_source:FCC|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Radio stations in Indianapolis, Indiana|KLU]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1992]]\n[[Category:K-Love radio stations]]\n[[Category:1992 establishments in Indiana]]\n[[Category:Educational Media Foundation radio stations]]","timestamp":"20160410105251","user-timestamp":"20150410105251"},{"title":"Talk:1992 Major Indoor Lacrosse League season","content":"{{Lacrosse|class=stub|importance=low}}\n\n==Image copyright problem with Image:MILL.gif==\nThe image [[:Image:MILL.gif]] is used in this article under a claim of [[WP:NFC|fair use]], but it does not have an adequate explanation for why it meets the [[WP:NFCC|requirements for such images]] when used here.

In its simple form Collaboration is all about working together to achieve goals.\n\n\nCollaboration is about challenging a group to adjust their thoughts, behaviours and efforts to reach a group decided goal. In contrast to co-operation, collaboration focuses on combining individual ideas and opinions to construct a concept. It is more than just working together; it is an agreement of what needs to be done to achieve what they need to. The process of collaboration is based on a strong, working relationship between two or more people who depend on each other to achieve goals. According to Australia Research Alliance for Children and Youth (ARACY), reducing duplication of information, opening up more opportunities and using limited resources more affectively and encouraging efficiency and effectiveness. ARACY define a group working in collaboration by the intensity of their relationship, which is the ways in which they depend on each other to achieve things and the way that the members of the group communicate and divide the amount of work and power. \n\n\nCollaboration is strongly linked to the idea that learning is a \u2018social process\u2019, used to help learners do things that they were unable to do without social support. It is also followed closely to the idea of scaffolding, where together as group students build and expand upon a thought until all learners have grasped the concept and they can they expand it together. An example of using this in the classroom is a situation where a question is asked and getting the students to answer it.\n\n\nIn previous times, a learner would have been expected to write down the answer silently in their own books; however this is often hard for young people and can also be quite daunting and intimidating. A way in which collaboration could be used in this situation is to ask the question and instead of encouraging individual work, allowing the students to discuss and develop an idea or answer in groups. This allows the students to make sure their thoughts are clear and concise before the put them down on paper and prompts multi perspective thinking.\nThere are many ways to foster collaboration within a classroom in regards to humanities and English. Group projects and group discussion, as mentioned, are great ways to engage students with one another in a collaborating sense because it forces them to discuss each other\u2019s points of view and take into consideration different points. (This is something that is often missing within cooperation groupings.) Giving each small group a discussion topic first allows students to voice their own particular opinion on the subject matter before starting work on the project, while in comparison just setting out a particular task often leads to delegation and uneven workloads within small groups. Within English subjects such a discussion is often a necessary part of assessment in regards to approaching a topic differently, especially when the small groups are a combination of learners with completely different learning styles. Within humanities subjects\u2019 discussion and debate if often a necessary part of an assessment process; collaboration creates access to completely different (and often challenging) ideas, some of which many students would not perhaps considered as an appropriate answer to their particular topic otherwise. \n\n\nHowever, getting your students to collaborate together isn't as simple as putting people in a group and telling them to get on with a project. It requires consideration on the part of a teacher and understanding about the students you have. A starting point would be for students to be arranged in small groups, the size of which is determined by table size and get the students used to group work. Modelling the appropriate values of communication and scaffolding the lesson plans so that the students begin to rely and trust each other's ideas and work together towards common goals. Once the routine is established with the students the classic environment of group work need no longer be held to.\n\n\nFor example, working with an English class who are studying Shakespeare, students could be assigned a task to design a web-space in relation to a text. Each student, having already learned to rely and trust each other can work together in order to work towards a goal together. As a safeguard there are programs that you could designate that would allow you to monitor who is contributing what to the content and help you assist where there are communication breakdowns.\nAnother example, working in a History class who are discussing the first world war, have these collaborative groups each discuss a topic that the team needs to research, such as the reasons behind the first world war. Have them then run an online forum where they can discuss the topic with people from around the world. As a teacher, you can invite others in your field to ask learners questions and as each person will have a student handle you can assist the students with their forums, making sure that the collaboration and participation is occurring and then as a class, pool the collective information into a dialogue about the topics.\n\n\n\n\nResources \n\nhttp:\/\/www2.gsu.edu\/~wwwltc\/howto\/enablestudentcollab.htm\nReference: ARACY- What is collaboration?

In the past, you interacted a lot with the page [[List of Irish clans]], and you were discussing the page content on the talk page. And I see that you started a new page [[List of Irish clans in Ulster]], so you must have a reasonable knowledge about the Irish Clans. \n\nBut this is my question - on the page [[List of Irish clans]], yes, I know you didn't start the page, and you didn't add all the content, but I am wondering if you know where the user [[User:Martin32]] got his information for the page? Have you any idea what book he got that information? Its very difficult to contact people on Wikipedia so I don't know how to contact Martin32 who might not be logging into his account, or checking his user talk page. \n\nMabuska, have you any idea what book he might have got all that clan information from? In particular, I want to know what book he got this clan information from;\n\nHe listed;\n\n-Tellach Cearbhallan\n\n-Finer, son of C\u00famscrach (aka Cumascrach)\n\n-Maoil Mhiadhaigh (Mulvey)\n\n-\u00d3 Beigl\u00e9ighinn (BEGLIN, BEGLAN, BEGLAIN, BEGNAL, BEGLANE, BIGLANE, BEGLEN, BEGLLIN, BIGLAN, BEGLYN ), \u00d3 Bardain (BODEN ), \u00d3 hEolusa (HALLISSY), \u00d3 Muiredaigh (MURRAY, MORIE, MORRA, MORRIE, MOREY, \u00d3MORY, MURRY, MURRIE), \u00d3 Cuirnin, ollamh (CURNIN, CURNAN, CURNEN), \u00d3 Maolghuala (MULHOOLY, HOOGHLEY, MULHOOGHLEY, MULOOLEY), Mac Mioluic (MULLOCK MacMEELICK, MacMOLEG, MOOLICK, MULLICKE, MULOCK)\n\n-Leitrim baronies of Mohill and Leitrim\n\n-Muinter Eolais, Conmaicne R\u00e9in\n\nThis type of clan information is very specific, it can only be listed in a few books. Its not in John O'Hart's Irish Pedigrees. And its not in T.H. Mullin and J.E. Mullin (1966). \"The Ulster Clans\", North-West Books. And its not in Robert Bell (1988) . \"The Book of Ulster Surnames\", The Black Staff Press.\n\nThanks Mabuska for any help you can give me. [[User:John37309|John37309]] ([[User talk:John37309|talk]]) 01:13, 10 May 2015 (UTC)\n\n:Hiya. From the [[Special:Contributions\/Martan32|looks of it]], Martan32 doesn't edit too much, with scant edits over the years, the last being 1st January 2015. Looking at [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=List_of_Irish_clans&oldid=297999066 this edit] however, Martan32's didn't add the septs into the article. Instead [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=List_of_Irish_clans&diff=prev&oldid=298039853 this is the edit], [[Special:Contributions\/79.97.17.84|by an IP]] (inactive since 2009) that added a lot of stuff into the article over a period. All unsourced.\n:[[Special:Contributions\/Eirreannach|User:Eirreannach]] added [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=List_of_Irish_clans&diff=prev&oldid=310173706a few extra septs] to it as well. They also edited the [[\u00d3 Begl\u00e9ighinn]] article.\n:The thing I notice most about clan\/sept articles is that lots of random editors come and add original research to them with no references and the such to even give a hint of verifiability. Many of these edits are made using stuff gleaned off Google or just made up in their head, such as alternate English variations. \n:Hope this helps a bit. [[User:Mabuska|Mabuska]] <sup>[[User_talk:Mabuska|(talk)]]<\/sup> 11:17, 11 May 2015 (UTC)\n\n::Mabuska, thanks for replying. Very much appreciated!\n\n::So I had to piece things together to find out what happened. So on the 16th of June 2009, Martin32 is the person that actually started the page [[List of Irish clans]]. Martin32 makes 3 edits on the 16th and 17th of June 2009, adding info to the page. Then the next edits are made by IP address \"79.97.17.84\", and this IP address makes those next edits also on the 17th June 2009. And to be quite honest Mabuska, I suspected that the IP address \"79.97.17.84\", actually was Martin32, but I had no proof! But what are the chances of somebody else finding that brand new page that quickly, about 2 days after it was created?\n\n::Then I checked the talk page, and Martin32 did in fact talk once on the page. And he said, and I quote Martin32, \"I often contribute without signing in\". So that is proof that it was actually Martin32 that added the vast majority of information to the article, sometimes he signed in, and other times he didn't, and his IP address is \"79.97.17.84\". And then more specifically, I had a look at the specific edit that added the \"Tellach Cearbhallan\" information I quoted above, and yes, it was added by the IP address \"79.97.17.84\", who we know is Martin32 when he doesn't sign it!\n\n::I had a look at Martin32's talk page, and lots if people have posted stuff there. But Martin32 has never interacted with his own talk page. And he has not ticked the box to allow people to send him an email. So I just can't really contact Martin32. \n\n::Mabuska, all that aside, its not what is important here. He got the information somewhere, he got it from some book, just what is the book? And if he copied the info from another website, that website must also have gotten the info from a book. Its a massive amount of information about all the Irish clans. Its too much information to guess. Someone might well guess a small amount of information, but no, this is a monumentally large amount of information about all the Irish clans. And not only that, its good quality information, and its very well formatted. Therefore, there is some book, a very specific book, that has that information, written out in that specific format, about all the Irish clans, and linking them to those specific surnames. I want that book, I need that book!!! \n\n::Mabuska, I trying to find the root of the \"[[Hallissey]]\" surname, that is my surname, and I started that Hallissey Wikipedia page. Whatever book Martin32 got the information from, it translated \"\u00d3 hEolusa\" as \"HALLISSY\". If that is true, then Hallissey's are descended from [[Muintir Eolais]], and it easy to track the history. But Mabuska, i'm at my wits end here trying to find where us Hallissey's come from? I have been at this for 3 years now, or longer. I don't want to go and make the connection to Muintir Eolais, if it turns out in the end that its a bogus translation of the Irish word \"\u00d3 hEolusa\". So that is why the List of Irish Clans Wikipedia page is so important to me. Its the only reference I can find that translates \"\u00d3 hEolusa\" as \"HALLISSY\". \n\n::I have gone through several other surname books, and Hallissey is not mentioned in them, or if it does mention the surname, it translates the name as \"\u00d3 h\u00c1ilgheasa\" or \"descendant of \u00c1ilgheas\". And I just cannot find a person called \"\u00c1ilgheas\" in the Irish Annals. As far as I can tell, our surname is very small and doesn't appear until about 1700AD. And most of the old Irish annals finish well before 1700AD, so I can't make the connection back into the history books!\n\n::Mabuska, any advice or help you can give me would be much appreciated. [[User:John37309|John37309]] ([[User talk:John37309|talk]]) 15:48, 11 May 2015 (UTC)\n\n:::Actually Wikipedia isn't the only reference for that Anglicisation. The first hit for me on Google [https:\/\/www.google.co.uk\/search?q=%C3%93+hEolusa&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&gws_rd=cr&ei=2_xRVY6mF6Gx7Qbrs4HICg for \u00d3 hEolusa] got me [http:\/\/rainbowfarms.com.au\/SURNAMES%20-%20Halliman%20-%20Hammond..htm this site]. It makes mention of both: ''\"O Hallissy - Irish \/ Ui hEolusa\"'' and ''\"O Hallisey - Irish \/ Ua hAilgheasa \/ hAilgheasaigh \/ ailgheas\"''. Thoigh it states no sources, it could well be where the editor got the information from. A lot of the sept\/clan name articles\/information on this site come from such sites and contain a complete lack of verifiability and possible original research. \n:::I would venture that what one your Hallissey's come from depends on the spelling. It can be argued that Halli'''sey''' and Halli'''ssy''' affect how the name is pronounced hence those specific endings. Yours ends in '''sey''', so I'd lean towards ''\u00d3 h\u00c1ilgheasa'' instead of ''\u00d3 hEolusa''. Your location, or location of your paternal ancestors could also help determine as the two different septs are quite far apart (north Connacht compared to south Munster) in location.\n:::I wouldn't worry about not finding a name in the annals. Not all septs receive mention, and you are lucky to have such a unique surname that can be pinpointed to either of those two septs. Many people in Ireland will never know the true origin of their name due to the effects of Anglicisations and translations. Johnston is one simple example where you are either from John's Town, a son of John, or a McShane who translated their name into English. The surname Brown can be English, from Norman (de Brun), from Irish (Mac A Brehon), or even someone from the Clan Lamont. There are far more complicated examples where an Irish name was translated into English and all traces of the original Irish name are lost such as Armstrong. Armstrong is an English surname, however quite a few Lavery's and Trainor's in Ulster translated their name correctly or not to Armstrong. How will their descendants ever know? [[User:Mabuska|Mabuska]] <sup>[[User_talk:Mabuska|(talk)]]<\/sup> 13:38, 12 May 2015 (UTC)\n\n::::Mabuska, yes, your right. There are actually 3 places on the internet that have similar information translating  \"\u00d3 hEolusa\" as \"HALLISSY\". \n\n::::1. The Wikipedia page [[List of Irish clans]].\n::::2. The Wikipedia [[Template:Ulaid]] page.\n::::3. That Australian [http:\/\/rainbowfarms.com.au\/SURNAMES%20-%20Halliman%20-%20Hammond..htm Rainbow Farms] website that you found through Google.\n\n::::None of the 3 places quote the book reference where they got the information. A while back, I contacted the guy in Australia who owns the \"Rainbow Farms\" website, his name is Ernest, to ask where he got the information. And he said in the early 2000's, he found the information on \"another internet website\". He said he copied all the information to his own Rainbow Farms website, but never got any book reference for the information. And what ever website Ernest originally got the information from is now gone completely from the internet. \n\n::::The Wikipedia [[Template:Ulaid]] page. That has similar information linking the \"Hallissy\" surname to that specific group of other surnames, all descended from this [[Muintir Eolais]] sept, who are a branch of the [[Conmha%C3%ADcne| Conmaicne Magh R\u00e9in]]. But again, there is no book reference for the information. Its [[User:Cla\u00edomh Solais]] that created the Wikipedia [[Template:Ulaid]] page. And I posted a message on Cla\u00edomh Solais's talk page asking for a book reference, but I didn't get any reply yet. \n\n::::Ultimately these 3 sources of information, none of them quote a book reference, which is what I need here. I don't think any of them made it up, I do think its written down that way in some specific book because there is such a large amount of clan information. The problem is that its the only book that translates \"\u00d3 hEolusa\" as \"HALLISSY\".\n\n::::I do have one more clue to prove if the information is correct or not. I took an ancestral DNA test, and the DNA test ties me into a group of \"cousin surnames\". This list of \"cousin surnames\" the DNA test tied me into is a very loose collection of people in their DNA database who also took their DNA test. Its a long list of surnames, and the vast majority of the surnames are in fact Scottish surnames! I was quite shocked by this as the Hallissey surname is only found in Counties Cork and Kerry in the south west of Ireland. How could that be, I wondered?\n\n:::: I said before that the Hallissey surname is a very small surname, it starts up around the year 1700AD, in county Cork. But prior to that 1700AD date, the surname simply doesn't exist, at least not with any spelling like \"Hallissey\". Therefore, the progenitor for the whole group must come from someplace else. The progenitor who is born about 1700AD is not born in county Cork, he must come from someplace else. But where does he come from?\n\n::::As I said, the DNA test ties me into this very large group of \"cousin surnames\" that are mainly Scottish. There are almost no Munster surnames tied to me in the DNA test? But, and here is what give me great hope, there is one particular surname the DNA test does tie me into, and that surname is \"[[Reynolds (surname)|Reynolds]]\". Reynolds in Irish translates as \"[[Mac Raghnaill]]\", and low and behold, the Reynolds or Mac Raghnaill surname are descendants of [[Muintir Eolais]] in the baronies of Mohill and Leitrim, way up the north of the country. Its no where near counties Cork and Kerry where the Hallissey surname is found. \n\n::::Now Mabuska, this is where your knowledge of Irish History, and more specifically, Northern Irish History comes into play. If you know your ancient history of the Northern Irish clans, you will know that a very large chunk of the Scottish Clans are descendants of the Irish High King [[Rudraige mac Sithrigi]] who reigned around 289\u2013219 BC. The [[Muintir Eolais]] are also descendants of Rudraige mac Sithrigi. And that could well explain why my DNA test ties me into cousin surnames that are mainly Scottish, but it also ties me to this Irish surname Reynolds or Mac Raghnaill.\n\n::::Mabuska, at some point before the year 1700AD, there must be a story in one of the Irish or Scottish Annals, about a person who comes down from [[Muintir Eolais]] in county Leitrim, and settles in County Cork, and starts using the Hallissey surname. This is why I am so desperate to find the book that translates \"\u00d3 hEolusa\" as \"HALLISSY\". Without that book reference, the link is broken.  [[User:John37309|John37309]] ([[User talk:John37309|talk]]) 17:48, 12 May 2015 (UTC)\n:::::I can't help you with finding the book, though my main source for clan and sept names in Ulster does mention the Mac Raghnaill's of Leitrim, which Anglicised first as MacRannall and then to Reynolds and MacReynolds. The first of their main line to adopt the name Reynolds was Thomas M'Grannell in the 16th century. The problem is that there are quite a few different origins for the Reynolds of Ireland, especially in Ulster. Your Reynolds cousin-DNA may infact simply be the Scottish Mac Roanuill's, or even the Armagh and Tyrone Mag Raghainn, or even the Armagh O Reannachain's - all of which at some stage adopted Reynolds as there Anglicised name. That doesn't even take into account the possibility of Scots of Norman descent called Reynolds, a name which was introduced by the Normans to England as Reynaud and Raginald. But you do have the coincidence of Reynolds being a cousin-DNA and of one branch of Reynolds claimed as being from the \u00d3 hEolusa.\n:::::I also wouldn't put any faith whatsoever in the historical accuracy of ancient Irish genealogies. The majority of academics accept that they are works of fiction and propaganda, designed to give credence to territorial claims and forge an artificial and made-up kinship between conqueror and conquered people. Anything from before the 8\/9th century AD especially should be treated with the highest degree of suspicion. So I would disregard any link to Rudraige mac Sithrigi whatsoever as he is simply a legendary figure. There is also no such as thing as a genuinely historical High-King of Ireland until 846 AD, when the Ui Neill where making such claims, and even then the first to actually have any authority over the whole of Ireland was Brian Boru.\n:::::I've left messages on Cla\u00edomh Solais' talk page before in the past and he by on large simply ignores messages. [[User:Mabuska|Mabuska]] <sup>[[User_talk:Mabuska|(talk)]]<\/sup> 10:53, 13 May 2015 (UTC)\n\n::::::Mabuska, thank you my friend. Thank you for the tip about the other Scottish and Northern Ireland Reynolds clans. There is also an English origin for some of the Reynolds clans. Yes, I agree with you, while its an interesting coincidence my DNA test tied me to some ancient Reynolds cousins, I can't be sure the DNA test Reynolds are descendants of Muintir Eolais. The DNA test also tied me to hundreds of other surnames too, and as I said, mainly Scottish surnames. I have to treat the results of the DNA test with skepticism, but at the same time, I try to give each piece of evidence some \"weight\", how strong is the evidence, what proof is there to back-up the evidence, and so on. \n\n::::::Mabuska, I will just have to keep tipping away on my own trying to solve my mystery of where my ancient ancestors came from.

The act requires that [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] meet for at least a fifty-day session once every three years. It was intended to prevent kings from ruling without Parliament, as Charles had done between 1629 and 1640. If the King failed to call Parliament, the Act required the Lord Chancellor to issue the writs, and failing that, the House of Lords could assemble and issue writs for the election of the House of Commons. Clause 11 was unusual because it explicitly stated that this Bill would receive the [[royal assent]] before the end of the Parliamentary session. At that time, Bills did not customarily gain royal assent until after the end of the Session. Thus, if Clause 11 were not present, the Act may not have come into force until the next Parliament.<ref name=CS\/>\n\nIn 1664, it was repealed by the '''Triennial Parliaments Act 1664''' (16 Cha.

Date accessed: 5 March 2007.<\/ref> Though the new Act kept the requirement that a Parliament be called least once in three years, there was no mechanism to enforce this requirement. Thus, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] was able to rule for the last four years of his reign without calling a Parliament. \n\nUnder the '''Triennial Act 1694''', also known as the '''[[Meeting of Parliament Act 1694]]''' (6 & 7 Will. & Mar. c. 2), Parliament met annually and held general elections once every three years. The country now remained in a grip of constant election fever (10 elections in 20 years) and loyalties among MPs were difficult to establish, which increased partisanship and rivalry in Parliament. This state of political instability is often known as the '[[Rage of Party]]'. In 1716, the [[Septennial Act 1715|Septennial Act]] was passed, under which a Parliament could remain in being for up to seven years. This Act ushered in a period of greater stability in British politics, with long-lasting Parliaments and Governments typical throughout much of the 18th century.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal |title=The summoning and meeting of new Parliaments in the United Kingdom |author=Robert Blackburn |journal=Legal Studies |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=165\u2013176 |year=1989 |doi=10.1111\/j.1748-121X.1989.tb00392.x}}\n\n{{UK legislation}}\n\n[[Category:1641 in law]]\n[[Category:1664 in law]]\n[[Category:1694 in law]]\n[[Category:17th century in England]]\n[[Category:Acts of the Parliament of England]]\n[[Category:Acts of the Parliament of England still in force]]\n[[Category:Election legislation]]\n[[Category:Election law in the United Kingdom]]","timestamp":"20160410105308","user-timestamp":"20150410105308"},{"title":"User talk:Kstemmer","content":"\n\n\n==Notability of [[:Kai juenemann]]==\n[[Image:Information_icon.svg|left]]Hello, this is a message from [[User:CSDWarnBot|an automated bot]].

However, because it has a long history, I decided it may be salvageable. First, I cut out all unnecessary external links per [[WP:EL]]. Please do not reinsert links.

I'll work on the article some more later. I recommend looking at some well established articles of similar topics to get an idea of what is appropriate.

The following year, he was admitted to the Beta Sigma Fraternity in UP, Diliman.\n\nAfter his graduation from the Far Eastern University Institute of Medicine in 1961 as class president and one of the seven outstanding members of his class, Philip, who was then the national president of the Student PMA, represented the Philippines in the International Federation of Student Medical Associations in Israel, as a grantee of the Asia Foundation. He carried and presented the official message from then Philippine President Carlos P. Garcia before the General Assembly of delegates from the various countries.\n\nIn 1962, Philip, who was an Adjunct Surgeon at FEU Hospital in Manila, became the pioneer medical volunteer of the Work-A-Year-With-The-People project of then Senator Raul Manglapus, Manuel Quezon, Jr., and now incumbent Senator Ramon Magsaysay, Jr., and served the people of the doctorless remote and secluded town of Palanan, Isabela, by the Sierra Madre mountains. He was flown there by Mike Campos, President of the Philippine Insular Life  Company, in his Beechcraft Baron, also carrying medical supplies. Mike would do that regularly as a friend of the Carmelite Fathers in whose convent Philip and his medical clinic were quartered.\n\nFollowing this Palanan medical mission, Philip, whose 46-year old Dad died of heart attack in 1962, and his wife Farida Quiambao Isip, also of Class \u201961, left the Philippines and interned at the Ravenswood Hospital in Chicago. \n\nIn 1965, Philip became the first Filipino to be accepted as a surgical resident at the prestigious Hines V. A. Hospital - Loyola University - University of Illinois program. There, he completed his 4-year general and vascular surgery residency training, followed by a two-year thoracic and cardiovascular surgery residency, and a 6-month stint at Children\u2019s Memorial Hospital in Chicago for pediatric cardiac surgery. \n\nHis Chief at Hines, Dr. Charles B. Puestow (known worldwide for the Puestow Procedure for pancreatic carcinoma), was so impressed by Philip in those almost 6-1\/2 years at Hines, that some of his private patients, with their permission, were operated on by Dr. Chua with him assisting. In 1971, Dr. Puestow personally called Dr. Cooley and recommended Philip for the much-coveted Fellowship in cardiac surgery at the Texas Heart Institute.\n\nIn 1972, Philip was elected by his fellow cardiac surgeons as Founding President of the Denton A. Cooley Cardiovascular Surgical Society, an exclusive association of more than 900 cardiac surgeons from more than 52 countries around the world who trained under Dr. Cooley. \n\nAfter his Fellowship at the Texas Heart Institute in Houston, Philip moved to Northwest Indiana and started private practice in cardiovascular-thoracic surgery which expanded and eventually became a 4-man cardiac surgery team, the Cardiovascular Surgery Associates, which he chaired. Philip was active in medical politics on top of his busy practice. \n\nAfter the declaration of Martial Law in the Philippines by dictator Ferdinand Marcos on September 21, 1972, Philip were among the ardent supporters of the Ninoy Aquino Movement of exiled Senator Benigno S. \"Ninoy\" Aquino, Jr., the arch-enemy of Marcos, and the Movement for Free Philippines of Senator Raul Manglapus, both anti-Marcos organizations in the United States. In 1982, Philip and Farida were guests at the home of Ninoy and Cory Aquino in Newton, a suburb of Boston. Before returning to the Philippines, Ninoy visited Chicago and the Chua residence in Munster, Indiana, where Philip gave Ninoy a medical check-up. Upon Ninoy's return to the Philippines on that fateful day of August 21, 1983, he was assasinated at the Manila International Airport. His wife, Cory Aquino, thru the world-famous bloodless EDSA People Power Revolution, dethroned and banished the dictator Marcos on February 25, 1986, and Cory was sworn in as the 11th President of the Philippines, returning freedom and democracy to the Philippines. For the 1986 Christmas celebration at the Malacanang Palace, Philip and Farida were personal guests of President Cory Aquino. The following year, the Chuas were invited to the Palace again, this time with their children. President Cory died from colon cancer on August 1, 2009. Philip, who is Convenor of the US Pinoys for Good Governance(formerly US Pinoys for Noy-Mar, with chapters across the United States) and the members of the USP4NM, intensively campaigned nationwide for the 2010 election of Benigno S.C. Aquino III, the son of Ninoy and Cory, who subsequently won by a landslide, and is now the 15th President of the Philippines.\n\nIn 1999, Philip completed the intensive didactic and laboratory hands-on surgical seminar on OPCAB (Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass on Beating Heart) Surgery, at the Boston University Hospital, under Professor William Cohn, MD, FACS.\n\nDr. Chua\u2019s international involvement included:\t\n\nSurgical Demonstrations of Coronary Bypass Surgeries at the First Teaching Hospital of the Beijing Medical University, Beijing, China, at the official invitation of Beijing Medical University, performing a total of 18 cases in 1989 and in 1991, with his Indiana cardiac surgery team he brought with him, including his associate, Dr. Victor K. O\u2019Yek. The audience was composed of Chinese cardiac surgeons eager to learn western coronary bypass surgery.\n\nPhilip and Farida were also active in medical missions since the mid-80s, the latest one being in October 2011 in Macabebe, Pamanga.\n\nFrom the time they arrived in Chicago on January 1, 1963, Philip held the following positions :\n\nEditor, The PMA Chicago Bulletin, 1964-1965\n\nPresident, Philippine Medical Association of Chicago, 1965-1966\n\nEditor, Lake County Medical Society Bulletin, Indiana, 1988-1996\n\nEditor, The Philippine Surgeon, 1972-1995  \n\nPresident, Medical Staff, St. Mary Medical Center, Gary and Hobart, Indiana, 1980-1982\n\nPresident, Medical Staff, St. Anthony Medical Center, 1982-1984.\n\nPresident, Society of Philippine Surgeons in America, 1984-1985\n\nChairman of the Board, Physicians Choice of Northwest Indiana (PCNI), the first PPO (the first physician-owned healthcare insurance service provider) in the area, with 5 hospitals, 52 pharmacies, and 120 physicians as members, 1985\n\t\nPresident, Association of Philippine Physicians in America (APPA), 1986-1987.\n\nPresident, Medical Staff, The Methodist Hospitals, Inc. 1986-1987.\n\nPresident, American Heart Association, Northwest Indiana Chapter, 1988\n\nPresident, FEU-DNR School of Medicine Alumni Foundation (USA), 1995-1999\n\nMember, Board of Trustees, FEU-NR Medical Foundation, Fairview, Quezon City, Philippines (1998 -2008)\t\n        \nChairman of the Board, FEU-DNR School of Medicine Alumni Foundation (USA), 2002-2004\n\nChairman Emeritus, FEU-DNR School of Medicine Alumni\nFoundation (USA) since 2004\n\nChairman, Filipino United Network \u2013 USA, a 501(c)(3)\nTax-exempt Foundation, an advocacy group for Good\nGovernance and Ethical leadership in the Philippine,\n2007 \u2013 present\n\nConvenor, US Pinoys for Noynoy-Mar, now US Pinoys for\nGood Governance, 2009 \u2013 present\n\nCardiac Surgeon Emeritus, Northwest Indiana, since\nJanuary 2001\n\nPhysician Emeritus (Surgery), Cebu Doctors\u2019 University\nHospital (since January 2011)\n  \nAWARDS:\n\nMost Outstanding Betan, BS Midwest Chapter, 1988 \nMost Outstanding Leadership Award, PMA Chicago, 1966\nMost Outstanding Physician, PMA Chicago, 1967\nMost Outstanding Medical Alumni, FEU-DNR School of\nMedicine Alumni Foundation, awarded in Anaheim,\nCalifornia, August 11, 1981. \n\nMost Distinguished Betan in Medicine, Beta Sigma Fraternity, presented by former President Joseph Estrada, San Francisco, California, 1994\n\nSagamore of the Wabash Award (The highest civilian award bestowed by then Indiana Governor, now U.S. Senator, Evan Bayh), 1996\n\nBeta Sigma Testimonial Dinner Honoree, Club Filipino, Greenhills, San Juan, hosted by then Secretary of Agrarian Reform Horacio \u201cBoy\u201d Morales, December 2, 2000\n \nCrystal Globe Award, Asian American Medical Society -U.S.A., November 9, 2002\n\nMost Outstanding Golden Jubilarian Award, Arellano High School, Class \u201953, given on February 22, 2003 at the Club Filipino, Manila (Was Guest Speaker, Arellano High School Foundation Day, March 4, 2003)\n\nRecipient, PEACE (USA) Most Outstanding Family Award (\u201cA Family of Eleven Physicians\u201d), June 14, 2008, Atlantic City, New Jersey\n \nMEMORIAL LECTURER:\n\nThe Dean Lauro H.

The left-to-right column projection actually was my first attempt to generate a symmetric Petrie polygon view, before the correct projections were created. In my attempt, I determined the Petric polygon, and picked a [u,v] basis with u direction determined by a sum of the petrie polygon vertices so it came out as one vertex on the left, opposite vertex right, and progressive vertex-edge-vertex distances came out as vertical columns. So it was accidental, but interesting, so I kept it and another guy converted the projection from PNG to SVG.

The ''Mimosa'' had cost \u00a32,500 to hire for the voyage and convert to passenger use, and the fare from [[Liverpool]] to Patagonia was \u00a312 for adults and \u00a36 for children, although anyone willing to travel was taken on the journey regardless of ability to pay.<ref>{{cite web |url=http:\/\/www.casahistoria.net\/mimosa1.htm |title=Welsh immigrants in Patagonia: Mimosa, the old ship that sailed into history |accessdate=2007-01-05 |last=Wilkinson |first=Susan |date= September 1998 |work=(originally) Buenos Aires Herald }}<\/ref> The ''Mimosa'' settlers, including [[tailor]]s, [[shoemaker|cobbler]]s, [[carpenter]]s, [[brick]]makers, and [[miner]]s, comprised 56 married adults, 33 single or widowed men, 12 single women (usually sisters or servants of married immigrants), and 52 children; the majority (92) were from the [[South Wales Coalfield]] and English urban centres.<ref name=\"Glyn Williams\"\/>{{rp|35}} There were few [[farmer]]s, which was rather unfortunate particularly when they discovered that the attractions of the area had been oversold and they had landed in an arid semi-[[desert]] with little food; they had been told that the area was like lowland Wales. At the coast there was little [[drinking water]], and the group embarked on a walk across the parched plain with a single wheelbarrow to carry their belongings. Some died and a baby, Mary Humphries, was born on the march. John Williams was the only colonist with any form of rudimentary [[medicine|medical]] skill.\n\nOnce they reached the valley of the Chubut River, their first settlement was a small fortress on the site which later became the town of [[Rawson, Chubut|Rawson]], now the capital of Chubut province.<ref name=\"Glyn Williams\"\/>{{rp|45}} This was referred to as ''Yr Hen Amddiffynfa'' (The Old Fortress).<ref name=\"Glyn Williams\"\/>{{rp|44}} The first houses, constructed from earth, were washed away by a flash flood in 1865, and new houses of superior quality were built to replace them.<ref name=\"Glyn Williams\"\/>{{rp|45\u201347}} The floods also washed away crops of potatoes and maize.<ref name=\"Glyn Williams\"\/>{{rp|52}} The rainfall in the area was much less than the colonists had been led to expect, leading to crop failures.\n\n=== Consolidation 1866\u20131888 ===\n[[File:Welshpeople.jpg|thumb|Welsh traditions in Rawson]][[File:Y Drafod.jpg|thumb|Y Drafod]]\nThe settlers first made contact with the local [[Tehuelche people]] almost a year after their arrival. After some difficult early years of suspicion and some violence, the Tehuelche people established cordial relationships with the Welsh and helped the settlement survive the early food shortages. The settlers, led by Aaron Jenkins (whose wife Rachel was the first to bring up the idea of systematic use of irrigation canals), soon established Argentina's first [[irrigation]] system based on the Chubut River (in Welsh, ''Afon Camwy'', \"winding river\"), irrigating an area three or four miles (five or six km) to each side of the 50-mile (80&nbsp;km)-long stretch of river and creating Argentina's most fertile wheatlands. Initially the settlers were largely self-governing, with all men and women of 18 years of age or over having the right to vote. By 1885 wheat production had reached 6,000 tons, with wheat produced by the colony winning the gold medal at international expositions at [[Paris]] and [[Chicago]].\n\n[[File:Harvest time in Patagonia.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Harvest time in Patagonia, c.1880]]\n\nThe mouth of the [[River Chubut]] was difficult to navigate, being shallow and with shifting sandbanks, and it was decided that a railway was required to connect the Lower Chubut valley to [[Puerto Madryn]] (originally Porth Madryn) on the [[Golfo Nuevo]] on the southern side of the [[Valdes Peninsula]].<ref name=\"Glyn Williams\"\/>{{rp|80\u201381}} Lewis Jones was the driving force, and in 1884 the Argentine Congress authorised the construction of a railway, the Ferrocarril Central del Chubut, by Lewis Jones y Cia. Raising funds for the project locally proved difficult, so Lewis Jones went to the [[United Kingdom]] to seek funds, where he enlisted the assistance of Asahel P. Bell, an engineer. Work on the railway began in 1886, helped by the arrival of another 465 Welsh settlers on the steamer ''Vesta''. The town which grew at the railhead was named ''[[Trelew]]'' (Town of Lew) in honour of Lewis Jones.<ref name=\"Glyn Williams\"\/>{{rp|86}} The town grew rapidly and in 1888 became the headquarters of the \"Compa\u00f1\u00eda Mercantil del Chubut\" (Chubut Trading Company).\n\nIn January 1868, the first newspaper of the colony, ''Y Brut'' (The Chronicle), appeared; ''Ein Breiniad'' (Our Privilege) followed in 1878. Both were short-lived with only six issues of each title being circulated. Lewis Jones established ''Y Dravod'' (Discussion) in 1891, and this had greater longevity, with a weekly issue being produced until 1961.<ref name=NLW>{{cite web|title=The Welsh colony in Patagonia|url=https:\/\/www.llgc.org.uk\/collections\/learn-more\/printedmaterials\/the-press-of-the-welsh-colony-in-patagonia\/|website=Collections: Printed materials|publisher=The National Library of Wales|accessdate=19 June 2015|date=2015}}<\/ref>\n\n=== Expansion towards the Andes 1885\u20131902 ===\n[[File:GaimanWelshSchool.JPG|thumb|A Welsh school in Patagonia]]\nBy the mid-1880s most of the good agricultural land in the Lower Chubut valley had been claimed, and the colonists mounted a number of expeditions to explore other parts of Patagonia to seek more cultivable land. In 1885 the Welsh asked the governor of [[Chubut Province|Chubut]], [[Luis Jorge Fontana]], for permission to arrange an expedition to explore the [[Andean]] part of Chubut. Fontana decided to accompany the expedition in person. By the end of November 1885 they had reached a fertile area which the Welsh named \"Cwm Hyfryd\" (Pleasant Valley). By 1888, this site at the foot of the [[Andes]] had become another Welsh settlement,<ref name=NLW\/> named in Spanish \"Colonia 16 de Octubre\". As the population grew here, the towns of [[Esquel]] and [[Trevelin]] were founded.\n\nThis area became the subject of a [[Cordillera of the Andes Boundary Case 1902|dispute between Argentina and Chile]]. Initially the border was defined by a line connecting the highest peaks in the area, but it later became clear that this line was not the same as the line separating the watersheds, with some of the rivers in the area flowing westwards. [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]] agreed that the [[United Kingdom]] should act as arbitrator, and the views of the Welsh settlers were canvassed. In 1902, despite an offer of a league of land per family from [[Chile]], they voted to remain in [[Argentina]].\n\n=== Setbacks in the Lower Chubut Valley 1899\u20131915 ===\nSerious damage was caused by floods in the 1890s and 1900s, which devastated Rawson and to a lesser extent Gaiman, though [[Trelew]] was not affected. There was also disagreement between the settlers and the [[Argentine government]], which introduced [[conscription]] and insisted on males of military age drilling on Sundays. This ran counter to the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbatarian]] principles of the settlers and caused much ill-feeling, though the matter was eventually resolved by the intervention of the [[Argentine president]] [[Julio Argentino Roca]]. These factors, and a lack of unclaimed farmable land, caused 234 people to leave for [[Liverpool]] aboard the ''Orissa'' on 14 May 1902, with 208 of them subsequently travelling to [[Canada]], arriving at [[Saltcoats, Saskatchewan]] in late June,<ref>{{cite web |url=http:\/\/www.multiculturalcanada.ca\/ecp\/content\/welsh.html |title=Multicultural Canada \u2014 Welsh |accessdate=2007-07-01 |last=Williams |first=Colin H. |work=Multicultural Canada Project, Simon Fraser University |archiveurl = https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20070626222921\/http:\/\/www.multiculturalcanada.ca\/ecp\/content\/welsh.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-26}}<\/ref> although some of these families later returned to Chubut. Some other settlers moved to [[Rio Negro Province]] in Argentina. Many of those who left Chubut were late arrivals who had failed to obtain land of their own, and they were replaced by more immigrants from [[Wales]]. By the end of the 19th century there were some 4,000 people of Welsh descent living in Chubut. The last substantial migration from Wales took place shortly before [[World War I]], which put a halt to further immigration. Approximately 1,000 Welsh immigrants arrived in Patagonia between 1886 and 1911; on the basis of this and other statistics, Glyn Williams estimated that perhaps no more than 2,300 Welsh people ever migrated directly to Patagonia.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Glyn Williams | year=1969 | title=The Welsh in Patagonia: A Demographic Note | journal=Norsk Tidsskrift for Sprogvidenskap | pages=238 | volume=Supplementary volume }}<\/ref>\n\n===Later development===\nIn time the colony proved remarkably successful, although as immigration to the area after 1914 was mainly from [[Italy]] and other southern European countries, the Welsh gradually became a minority. As well as the irrigation system, the creation of a [[Co-operative]] Society ''(Compa\u00f1\u00eda Mercantil de Chubut)'' was crucial. The Society traded on the settlers' behalf in [[Buenos Aires]] and acted as a bank with 14 branches. The strong chapel-based society was also important, with an emphasis on mutual help and support, social activities and insurance schemes. However, the Co-operative Society collapsed in the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, and many lost their savings. The construction of a dam on the Rio Chubut 120&nbsp;km west of [[Trelew]], inaugurated on 19 April 1963, removed the risk of flooding in the Lower Chubut Valley.\n\nThe Welsh have left their mark on the landscape, with [[windmills]] and [[chapels]] across the province, including the distinctive wood and corrugated zinc Capel Salem and [[Trelew]]'s Salon San David, an attempt to reproduce [[St David's Cathedral]], [[Pembrokeshire]]. Many settlements along the valley bear Welsh names.\n\n[[File:Capel Bethel.jpg|thumb|A Welsh chapel in Gaiman]]\nOver the years use of the [[Welsh language]] declined, and there was comparatively little contact between Wales and Chubut for many years after 1914. Things began to change when a large number of Welsh people visited Patagonia in 1965 for celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the colony. Since then there has been a great increase in the number of visitors from Wales. Teachers are sent to assist in keeping the language alive, and there is some social cachet in knowing the language\u2014even among people who are not of Welsh ancestry. There are still important cultural activities, including [[chapel]], [[poetry]] and Welsh teas served in teahouses alongside the river in Gaiman and [[Dolavon]]. In 2006, the links between the Chubut Valley and Wales were again underscored, this time in a sporting context. The first of a [[2006 mid-year rugby test series|two-Test tour]] to [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] by the [[Wales national rugby union team]] was played in [[Puerto Madryn]], a 27\u201325 win for Argentina. Another example of the Argentina-Wales connection is that Welsh Centre in [[London]] has been for many years one of the main venues for dancing [[Argentine tango]].\n\nPrincipal settlements in the area are [[Puerto Madryn]], [[Trevelin]] (\"Milltown\"), [[Rawson, Chubut|Rawson]], [[Trelew]], [[Dolavon]] and [[Gaiman, Chubut|Gaiman]].\n\n== Welsh language names for Argentine places ==\n[[File:Beach at Puerto Madryn.jpg|thumb|The beach at Puerto Madryn]]\n[[File:Patagonia Anthem.JPG|thumb|A version of the [[Welsh national anthem]] written for the Welsh of Patagonia.

He earned a master's degree at [[Harvard]] and taught English at the [[University of Missouri]]. During World War I, he served in the military and was afterwards appointed assistant national director of the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee#Founding|American Jewish Relief Committee]]. He later became a drama and film critic for the ''[[Jewish Tribune]]'' until the early 1920s, when he went to Hollywood to become a reader for [[Samuel Goldwyn]]. Later he worked as a script clerk for directors [[King Vidor]] and [[Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m]] before becoming a screenwriter at [[MGM]] in 1924.\n\nLewin was appointed head of the studio's script department and by the late 20s was [[Irving Thalberg]]'s personal assistant and closest associate. Nominally credited as an associate producer, he produced several of MGM's most important films of the 1930s. After Thalberg's death, he joined [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] as a producer in 1937, where he remained until 1941.

It is a short steel [[truss bridge]] originally located downstream in [[Carbondale, Colorado|Carbondale]] and later moved to its present location.\n\nIt takes its current name from designer and builder Charles Sheely. When built as a highway bridge in the early 20th century it was one of the first in the state to use [[rivet]]s. It served its original purpose until the 1960s. In 1985 it was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and is one of two bridges in Aspen with that distinction, along with the [[Maroon Creek Bridge]] at the city's west end.\n\n==Structure==\n\nThe bridge is located on Mill Street Park north of downtown Aspen, {{convert|200|ft}} east of the intersection of North Mill and Puppy Smith streets. It is roughly in the center of the park, crossing the Roaring Fork between an open field and ponds to the south and a wooded area to the north between the bend in the river downstream and Gibson Avenue. On the west side of North Mill is a shopping plaza; north of Gibson is a residential area.\n\nStructurally, it is a five-panel steel [[Through truss#Pratt truss|Pratt through truss]]. It has a two-channel top chord with a cover plate and lacing; on the bottom chord are four angles with continuous plate. They are connected by verticals and diagonals of consisting of two angles and spacers each; the verticals further have two channels with lacing. Concrete wingwalls throughout provide [[superstructure#Bridges|substructure]]. The timber deck is supported by steel [[wikt:stringer|stringers]] and cross beams. There is latticework on both sides under the guardrail.<ref name=\"HABS\/HAER inventory\" \/>\n\n==History==\n\nDesigner Charles Sheely, founder of the Charles G. Sheely Construction Company, was one of the three major in-state bridge designers and builders of late 19th- and early 20th-century Colorado. His best-known works are the [[Rifle, Colorado|Rifle]] Bridge and [[Rainbow Arch Bridge (Fort Morgan, Colorado)|Rainbow Arch Bridge]], the last of which was the longest Marsh arch bridge in the world at the time of its construction.<ref name=\"Highway Bridges in CO MPS\">Fraser, Clayton; {{PDFlink|[http:\/\/www.historycolorado.org\/sites\/default\/files\/files\/OAHP\/crforms_edumat\/pdfs\/632.pdf Highway Bridges in Colorado, Multiple Property Submission]}}; [[History Colorado]]; March 30, 2000; retrieved October 8, 2011; p. 22.<\/ref>\n\nWhat is now known as the Sheely Bridge was originally built to carry [[Colorado State Highway 133|State Highway 133]] across the [[Roaring Fork River]] at [[Carbondale, Colorado|Carbondale]] in 1911, replacing an 1890s bridge that had deteriorated to the point that it could no longer be used or repaired. It was one of the first [[rivet]]ed [[truss bridge]]s built in the state, at a cost of $6,300 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|6300|1911|r=-3}}}} in modern dollars{{Inflation-fn|US}}). At the time it was {{convert|120|ft}} long.<ref name=\"HABS\/HAER inventory\" \/>\n\nAfter 55 years it was replaced in turn by a more modern bridge and moved to its current location in Aspen.<ref name=\"COAHP page\" \/> There it was shortened by removing two panels, to its current {{convert|87|ft|adj=on}} length. It is one of the few Sheely bridges in the state today, and the earliest riveted truss bridge remaining.<ref name=\"HABS\/HAER inventory\" \/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Colorado]]\n*[[National Register of Historic Places in Pitkin County, Colorado]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{National Register of Historic Places}}\n\n[[Category:Pedestrian bridges in Colorado]]\n[[Category:Bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Colorado]]\n[[Category:Pratt truss bridges]]\n[[Category:Bridges completed in 1911]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Aspen, Colorado]]\n[[Category:Former road bridges in the United States]]\n[[Category:Relocated buildings and structures in Colorado]]\n[[Category:1911 establishments in Colorado]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Pitkin County, Colorado]]","timestamp":"20160410105344","user-timestamp":"20150410105344"},{"title":"Harry Schafer","content":"{{For|the Austrian-American economist|Harry G.

The Kurdish rebellion was largely put down by mid-1980s. From 1985, however, the Iraqi [[Ba'ath]]ist regime under [[Saddam Hussein]] decided to eradicate pockets of Kurdish resistance in the north and strike down the [[peshmerga]] rebels by all means possible, including large-scale punishment of  civilians and the use of chemical weapons. The Halabja event was also part of Iraqi efforts to counter-attack Kurdish and Iranian forces in the final stages of [[Operation Zafar 7]].\n\n== Chemical attack ==\nThe five-hour attack began in the evening of March 16, 1988, following a series of indiscriminate conventional (rocket and [[napalm]]) attacks. Iraqi [[MiG#List of MiG aircraft|MiG]] and [[Mirage (aircraft)|Mirage]] aircraft began dropping chemical bombs on Halabja's residential areas, far from the besieged Iraqi army base on the outskirts of the town. According to regional Kurdish rebel commanders, Iraqi aircraft, coordinated by helicopters, conducted up to 14 bombings in sorties of seven to eight planes each. Eyewitnesses told of clouds of white, black and then yellow smoke billowing upward and rising as a column about {{convert|150|ft|m|sigfig=1}} in the air.<ref name=\"die\" \/>\n\n<blockquote>It was a beautiful spring day. As the clock approached 11:00 in the morning, I felt a strange sensation; my heart convulsed as if it were telling me that we were on the verge of a major calamity. Within minutes, artillery rounds began to explode in Halabja and planes began dropping bombs on the town. The bombing was concentrated on the northern neighborhoods, so we ran and hid in our basement. At 2 o'clock in the afternoon, as the intensity of the bombing wound down, I carefully sneaked out of the basement to the kitchen and carried food to my family. When the bombing stopped, we began to hear noises that sounded like metal pieces falling on the ground. But I didn\u2019t find an explanation.\n\nI saw things that I won't forget for as long as I live. It started with a loud strange noise that sounded like bombs exploding, and a man came running into our house, shouting, 'Gas! Gas!' We hurried into our car and closed its windows. I think the car was rolling over the bodies of innocent people. I saw people lying on the ground, vomiting a green-colored liquid, while others became hysterical and began laughing loudly before falling motionless onto the ground. Later, I smelled an aroma that reminded me of apples and I lost consciousness. When I awoke, there were hundreds of bodies scattered around me. After that I took shelter again in a nearby basement and the area was engulfed by an ugly smell. It was similar to rotting garbage, but then it changed to a sweet smell similar to that of apples. Then I smelled something that was like eggs.\n\nWhen you hear people shouting the words 'gas' or 'chemicals' -- and you hear those shouts spreading among the people -- that is when terror begins to take hold, especially among the children and the women. Your loved ones, your friends, you see them walking and then falling like leaves to the ground. It is a situation that cannot be described -- birds began falling from their nests; then other animals, then humans. It was total annihilation. Whoever was able to walk out of the town, left on foot. Whoever had a car, left by car. But whoever had too many children to carry on their shoulders, they stayed in the town and succumbed to the gas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.ekurd.net\/mismas\/articles\/misc2008\/3\/independentstate2078.htm |title=Halabja: Survivors talk about horror of attack, continuing ordeal |publisher=Ekurd.net |date=2008-03-15 |accessdate=2013-08-28}}<\/ref><\/blockquote>\n\nSurvivors said the gas at first smelled of sweet apples<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/birmingham\/content\/articles\/2006\/06\/22\/halabja_feature.shtml |title=Birmingham \u2013 Your Community \u2013 The Smell of Apples |publisher=BBC |date=2006-06-22 |accessdate=2013-08-28}}<\/ref> and reported that people died in a number of ways, suggesting a combination of toxic chemicals.

Nevertheless, the victims of the tragedy are often included in accounting the deaths attributable to the Anfal campaign, which was characterised by the widespread and indiscriminate use of chemical weapons by Iraq.

He said \"it was not as big as a nuclear [[mushroom cloud]], but several smaller ones: thick smoke.\" Golestan was shocked by the scenes on his arrival in the town, though he had seen gas attacks before at the front lines:\n\n<blockquote>It was life frozen. Life had stopped, like watching a film and suddenly it hangs on one frame. It was a new kind of death to me. (\u2026) The aftermath was worse. Victims were still being brought in.

According to his analysis of thousands of captured Iraqi secret police documents and declassified U.S. government documents, as well as interviews with scores of Kurdish survivors, senior Iraqi defectors and retired U.S. intelligence officers, it is clear that Iraq carried out the attack on Halabja, and that the United States, fully aware of this, nevertheless accused Iran, Iraq's enemy in a fierce war, of being partly responsible for the attack.<ref name=\"mind\" \/> This research concluded there were numerous other gas attacks, unquestionably perpetrated against the Kurds by the Iraqi armed forces. According to Hiltermann, the literature on the Iran-Iraq war reflects a number of allegations of chemical weapons use by Iran, but these are \"marred by a lack of specificity as to time and place, and the failure to provide any sort of evidence.\" Hiltermann called these allegations \"mere assertions\" and added that \"no persuasive evidence of the claim that Iran was the primary culprit was ever presented.\"<ref>''International Currency Review'', Volume 34.<\/ref> An investigation conducted by Dr Jean Pascal Zanders, Project Leader of the Chemical and Biological Warfare Project at the [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]], into responsibility for the Halabja massacre also concluded in 2007 that Iraq was the culprit, and not Iran.<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/cns.miis.edu\/pubs\/programs\/dc\/briefs\/030701.htm |archiveurl=http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20030102224708\/http:\/\/cns.miis.edu\/pubs\/programs\/dc\/briefs\/030701.htm |archivedate=2003-01-02 |title=Iranian Use of Chemical Weapons: A Critical Analysis of Past Allegations &#124; March 7, 2001 by Jean Pascal Zanders, SIPRI Chemical and Biological Warfare Project |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-28}}<\/ref>\n\nIn August 2013, ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' charged, based on recently declassified CIA documents and interviews with former intelligence officials, that the U.S. had firm evidence of Iraqi chemical attacks beginning in 1983.

Both parents had survived the [[Great Hunger]] or [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Potato Famine]] which occurred beginning in 1845, and both had walked the [[Panama Isthmus]] on foot to arrive in San Francisco, and later, Sacramento. His father, John, had participated in the [[Gold Rush]] in California and dug up 80 nuggets to purchase the undeveloped property, which became the Shields Ranch. He was the third child, and named Peter after his mother's first husband, who died of [[Cholera]] on the ship taking them from the Isthmus of Panama to [[San Francisco]], where she buried him in the sandy cliffs of the new city.\n==Personal life==\nHe married Carolee Wiltsie of Sacramento in 1901, and they celebrated their fiftieth anniversary in 1951.  The couple had one child that died in infancy.\n\nCarolee was an accomplished pianist, but made a career of supporting her husband's career, acting as chauffeur, taking care of his somewhat fragile health, and always his devoted companion.\n==Career==\nHe earned his first dollar trucking watermelons from the ranch to Sacramento. At 17 he graduated from [[Christian Brothers College (Sacramento)|Christian Brothers College]] in Sacramento, then studied law reading in the office of the distinguished Jurist Amos Catlin. Illness forced him to quit law during his twenties, but in his thirties, he was the private secretary to Governor [[James Budd]], Secretary of the State Agricultural Society, and a law partner of [[Hiram W. Johnson]] who was later elected a governor and a United States senator.\n\nIn 1900, at 38, he was elected to the [[Superior Court]] in Sacramento. During his years on the bench, he took his mother's passion and philosophy for agriculture and became deeply embedded in the California [[Agricultural Law]], policies and culture. \n\nOf all his accomplishments, he was most proud of being known as the father of [[UC Davis]], which he helped found in 1906. U.C. Davis  has grown into a major university and hospital.  The main U.C. Davis library and street still bear his name, and on campus there is an oak grove planted in his honor him. After his death, the Shields White Flower Garden was established when his wife of 60 years, Carolee died. It contains many of her favorite flowers. He is acknowledged as the man who did most to push through the [[California State Legislature]] a bill establishing the UC Davis Agricultural College, fought for the funds and even helped select the site. A Peter J. Shields Scholarship fund of $7500 was established in 1939.\n\nHe raised a prize-winning herd of Jersey Cattle and won so many prizes at the California State Fair, he finally withdrew to give others a chance to win. \n\nDuring his career, many friends and peers urged him to run for Congress or a higher court, or even another higher political office, but Judge Shields refused, saying his \"life and service belonged to the people of Sacramento\". In keeping with this pledge, he wrote an annual birth message in the ''[[Sacramento Bee]]'' imparting his generous and intelligent philosophy and personal wisdom, applied to the problems of the time and looking into the future. He also was active in promoting and establishing the [[Boy Scout]] movement in these region, and was an early president of the [[Golden Empire Council]]. Other accomplishments include being instrumental in the founding of the [[McGeorge School of Law]] in Sacramento.\n\nAt age 95, there was an article in the Bee citing a huge ovation of over 1000 students at UC Davis in Davis, Yolo County, and the college he established just west of Sacramento. In his annual birthday article, he called \"The advanced years time to perfect life's work.\" He died at 100, and left his entire estate to Carolee, and simple rites were held, but his death was a time for the Bee to recall and record much about this very beloved citizen, Judge and advocate, whose legacy lives on to the many thousands of students who have gone to UC Davis, joined the Boy Scout's in Sacramento, faced the well-thought out opinions of his Judgments, enjoy the fruits of the land growing in California, and to those who simply looked forward to his April 4 Birthday philosophy article in the Bee.\n\n==Politics==\nHe was a dedicated Jeffersonian [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and strong supporter of Congressman [[John E. Moss|John Moss]] and Governor [[Pat Brown|Edmund Brown]] of California, serving in the honorary capacities in the campaigns of the later both for attorney general and for governor. He was known to be a confidant of presidents, senators, governors and educators. \n\nBorn 36 years after the death of [[Thomas Jefferson]] and during [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s term as president, he had an early interest in politics, society, justice, and agriculture, which his mother Elizabeth had become especially involved with, winning many prizes at the state fairs and participating in agricultural societies. His deeper interest seemed to be in preparing the youth of the country to take hold of the future. \"I think it's time the old men should cease to distrust the youth by which they are surrounded,\" he once said. \"The young people I meet fascinate me. I think there never has been a time when the youth of the country have been so well prepared for the duties ahead of them.\" A philosopher, he talked of the courage of the youth, and felt it had \"Not been dimmed\" by failure. He also spoke of liking \"...Their rebellion against the outgrown condition of the past\". He felt \"That they are being well prepared for their impend responsibilities\" and was proud that youth were coming out of University with the facts of history, but with \"Minds that are told to form their own judgments.\"\n\n== References ==\n<!-- references should be inserted in the body of the article --><ref>\"Shields\", compiled by Robert E.

Anderson''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|PC|OC}} (born August 16, 1937 in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[British Columbia]]) is a former [[Canadian cabinet]] minister.\n\nEducated at Victoria College in Victoria, BC and the [[University of British Columbia Faculty of Law]], he graduated in 1962 with a LLB. During his UBC days Anderson won a silver medal for rowing in the 1960 Olympic Games, and a silver medal in the Pan American Games in Chicago in 1959. He was also a pilot in the University Reserve of the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]].\n\nAnderson served as a foreign service officer in the [[Department of External Affairs (Canada)|Department of External Affairs]] between 1962 and 1968. His posts included [[Indochina]] (International Supervisory And Truce Commissions) 1963-64, Assistant Canadian Trade Commissioner in [[Hong Kong]], 1964\u20131967, and [[China]] Desk Officer in Ottawa 1967-68.  In Hong Kong, Anderson attended the Institute of Oriental Studies of the [[University of Hong Kong]] and obtained the British Foreign Officer Higher Standard Certificate in [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]].\n\nHe was elected Liberal MP for the constituency of [[Esquimalt\u2014Saanich]] on [[Vancouver Island]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 1968|1968 federal election]]. Four years later he switched to provincial politics, and was elected leader of the [[Liberal Party of British Columbia|provincial Liberal Party]] (April 1972), then the third party in the provincial legislature with 5 out of 55 seats.  Although elected himself in the 1972 election, representing the constituency of Victoria, the Liberal Party did not increase its seat total. Anderson served as Member of the Legislative Assembly until his defeat in December 1975.\n\nDuring this period of elected office Anderson was prominent in representing Canadian concerns over offshore oil drilling, pipeline developments in Northern Canada, and oil tanker traffic between Alaska and the Lower 48 states.\n\nBetween 1976 and 1984, Anderson worked as an environmental consultant and adjunct professor at the [[University of Victoria]]'s School of Administration, where he taught in the fields of constitutional and administrative law, and environmental policy. His environmental work focused on coastal and wetland protection and marine pollution from oil exploration and transportation.\n\nAnderson was appointed as a member of the Immigration Appeal Board for a 10-year term in 1984. He served from March 1, 1984, until December 31, 1988, when the board was dissolved.\n\nIn the 1993 federal general election Anderson re-entered elected politics. He was elected MP for Victoria and retained this position for three subsequent elections, ending when he retired from politics in January 2006. During this period, he served in the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]] as Minister of National Revenue (1993\u201395), Minister of Transport (1995\u201397), and Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (1997\u201399). He also was appointed the regional political minister for British Columbia, which he retained until 2002.\n\nAnderson\u2019s time in the fisheries portfolio was marked by considerable controversy with the commercial fishing industry as he worked for strict conservation measures to protect fish stocks. These measures including a complete ban on the killing of [[Coho salmon]] in 1998. After six years of previous failures, he succeeded in getting an agreement with the United States under the [[Pacific Salmon Treaty]] to conserve salmon stocks and to end the destructive competitive fishing by the US and Canadian commercial fleets.\n\nIn the [[cabinet shuffle]] of 1999, Chr\u00e9tien appointed Anderson [[Minister of the Environment (Canada)|Environment Minister]]. He served in that post for the following five years, making him the longest serving Canadian environment minister. In this period Anderson\u2019s work largely centered around the [[Rio Summit]] conventions on biodiversity and climate change. He was successful in getting the [[Species at Risk Act]] passed by Parliament and signed into law (2004), and, despite strong objections from the governments of [[Saskatchewan]], [[Alberta]] and [[Ontario]] and the federal Official Opposition, in securing Canadian ratification of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] in December 2002.  Other initiatives involved improving air and water quality and established improved federal provincial cooperation on environmental issues.\n\nIn international work, Anderson was the first Canadian elected as president of the governing council of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]], a post he held for two years.  He took a prominent part in the [[G8]] and OECD Environment Minister\u2019s meetings. Anderson was dropped from cabinet by Prime Minister Paul Martin in 2004 and did not run in the 2006 election.\n\nIn February 2007 he was named director of the [[Guelph Institute for the Environment]], from which he retired in 2010.\n\nAnderson has received a number of environmental awards, including the John Fraser Award for Environmental Achievement from the [[Sierra Club of Canada]] (2005), the Dr. Andrew Thompson Award from [[West Coast Environmental Law]] for his lifetime contributions to the environment and sustainability in British Columbia (2004), and the 50th anniversary International Conservation Award (1998) from the [[Atlantic Salmon Federation]].\n\nHe was awarded an honorary doctoral degree in laws by the [[University of Victoria]] in 2007.,<ref>[http:\/\/communications.uvic.ca\/releases\/release.php?display=release&id=864]<\/ref> and an honorary doctorate of science from [[Wilfrid Laurier University]] in 2009.,<ref>[http:\/\/www.wlu.ca\/docsnpubs_detail.php?grp_id=2284&doc_id=36165]<\/ref>  He was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]] in 2010.<ref>[http:\/\/www.gg.ca\/document.aspx?id=13725&lan=eng Governor General announces 74 new appointments to the Order of Canada]<\/ref>\n\nAnderson is married to Sandra McCallum and they have two children: James and Zo\u00eb.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Like former Liberal leader [[St\u00e9phane Dion]], Anderson has a dog named Kyoto.

It is most commonly performed upon [[marriage]]. According to Western tradition, the wife normally adopts the husband's surname upon marriage. Name blending is an alternative practice that attempts to assign equal cultural value to each partner's surname. In November 2012 it was reported that 800 couples in the United Kingdom had opted to blend their surnames thus far that year, primarily among \"younger couples in their twenties or early thirties\", with this being a leading reason for the issuance of [[Deed Polls]] to change names.<ref name=\"Barnett\"\/>\n\nSince the late 1990s, it has also become common for [[celebrity]] couples to be given blended names in the media, usually made by combining elements of the [[given name]] of the people involved.<ref name=\"Clements\">Erin Clements, \"[http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2012\/04\/18\/kimye-celebrity-nicknames_n_1435267.html Kimye, Brangelina, Bennifer: The Evolution Of Celebrity Couple Nicknames]\", ''[[Huffington Post]]'' (April 18, 2012).<\/ref>\n\nFinally, name blending can also occur unintentionally when a double name created in one generation becomes combined and condensed in later generations.<ref>Adrian Room, ''An Alphabetical Guide to the Language of Name Studies'' (1996), p. 45.<\/ref>\n\n==Motivation==\n\n\nMany reasons are given for name-blending.\n\n* Couples may choose to adopt a blended name to enter into marriage \"with a completely new start without any history being tied to their surname\". Name blending confers the same surname upon both spouses. This allows the family to conform to the expectation that the family (and any children) will all share the same name, and avoid confusion that can arise when spouses retain differing surnames.<ref>[[Eviatar Zerubavel]], ''Ancestors and Relatives: Genealogy, Identity, and Community'' (2012), p. 84: \"Claiming our multiple roots and thereby acknowledging our genealogical complexity also imply claiming our multiple identities and thereby recognizing our existential complexity, as exemplified when we decide to give children surnames that would provide a bilateral account of their origins. Such practices may include compounding the parents' surnames (as when Ruderman and Wilgoren are compounded into Rudoren, Villar and Raigosa into Villaraigosa, and Dell and Osborne into Delborne), although they usually involve combining them through hyphenation. In both cases, however, the very notion of privileging one line of descent over the others is rejected, and the memory of more than just one ancestral past is formally preserved\".<\/ref><ref name=\"Barnett\"\/>\n* Name blending avoids the patriarchal practice of having the wife take the husband's name. In doing so, it is considered by many to be an extension of the [[feminist movement]]. <ref>Katie Roiphe, [http:\/\/www.slate.com\/id\/2097231\/ The Maiden Name Debate: What's changed since the 1970s?], ''[[Slate.com]]'' (March 16, 2004).<\/ref> \n* Name blending avoids hyphenation and the complications associated with having a [[double-barreled surname]] or other form of combined name that may be too long for use in some circumstances (for example, many computer databases limit last names to 16 characters).<ref name=\"Tuhus-Dubrow\">Rebecca Tuhus-Dubrow, \"[http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/11\/24\/fashion\/babies-surnames-to-hyphenate-or-not.html Children of the Hyphens, the Next Generation]\", ''[[The New York Times]]'' (November 23, 2011).<\/ref>\n* Name blending often creates a unique surname. In a world with over 1 billion internet users, having a unique last name can make it easier for people to find you using search engines. It also increases the chance that your name will be available as a username in e-mail systems and online communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/kk.org\/ct2\/2008\/07\/googleunique-names.php|title=GoogleUnique Names|author=Kevin Kelly|publisher=ct2}}<\/ref>\n* Name blending also provides an alternative for [[same-sex marriage]]s, where there are not longstanding traditions regarding the taking of one participants surname by the other.<ref name=\"Tuhus-Dubrow\"\/>\n\nIn the case of celebrity couples, where the names are chosen by the media (or arise from the public) rather than reflecting a choice by the couple, it has been suggested that the assignment of a nickname makes fans feel closer to the couple.<ref name=\"Clements\"\/> The popularity of celebrity [[supercouple]] [[Ben Affleck]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]] from 2002 to 2004 resulted in their being known by the [[portmanteau]] \"Bennifer\" (for Ben and Jennifer) to the media, as well as to fans using the name combination.<ref name=\"NEws.bbc.co.uk\">{{cite news | title=Designer hopes for love in games | publisher=BBC NEWS | accessdate=2007-06-15| url=http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/technology\/6434471.stm | date=2007-03-09 | first=Darren | last=Waters}}<\/ref><ref name=\"www.comcast.net\">{{cite web|title=Top Celebrity Supercouples of All Time|publisher=[[Comcast]]\/[[Comcast Interactive Media]]|year=2009|accessdate=2009-12-05|url=http:\/\/www.comcast.net\/slideshow\/entertainment-supercouples\/20\/}}<\/ref> The term ''Bennifer'' itself became popular, and started the trend of other celebrity couples being referred to by the combination of each other's first names, as with [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Angelina Jolie]] (\"Brangelina\"),<ref name=www.comcast.net\/><ref name=\"www.theage.com.au\">{{cite news| title=The Brangelina fever|publisher=''[[The Age]]''|date=2006-02-06|accessdate=2007-04-14|url=http:\/\/www.theage.com.au\/articles\/2006\/02\/06\/1139074140202.html | location=Melbourne}}<\/ref> and [[Kanye West]] and [[Kim Kardashian]] (\"Kimye\").<ref name=\"Clements\"\/> Robert Thompson, director of the Centre for the Study of Popular Television, said \"as silly as it sounds, this new tendency to make up single names for two people, like 'Bennifer' (Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez) and 'TomKat' (Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes), is an insightful idea'.

[[Mount Inyangani]] and the [[Nyanga National Park]] forms the western boundary of the valley.\n\n==Access==\nApproaching from Mutare, the turn-off is about 50&nbsp;km along the road towards [[Nyanga, Zimbabwe|Nyanga]]. The road into the valley is tarred and twists and turns steeply as it drops 800 meters in about 20&nbsp;km. Off the tarred road, there are good dust roads which service most parts of the Valley.ojo\nkjiylhl\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate of Honde Valley falls within the Savannah sub. From late October to around the end of April, the weather is hot and humid. Temperatures may rise up to 28 \u02daC and this is the period where most of the rainfall is received. From May to the beginning of July, the temperatures are very low and they may hover around minimums of 2 \u02daC while August is very windy. From September to October, it is very hot and the maximum temperatures may average 30 \u02daC.\nMost of the rainfall experienced is of the convectional type. At time orographic rainfalls at various times of the year, in addition to the normal convectional rainfall. This portion of the country, therefore, receives the highest rainfall in the country.\n\n===Topography===\nThe average altitude of Honde Valley is around 900m above sea-level as compared to its immediate surroundings which rise above 1800m. This abrupt drop in topography creates the spectacular Mtarazi and adjacent Muchururu Falls, local tourist attractions.\n\n===Flora===\nThe 500 square kilometres of the Honde Valley in Zimbabwe are extensively cultivated, often with gravity fed irrigation channels. Extensive use is made of the many smaller tributaries feeding into the [[Pungwe River]] in this portion of the Honde Valley.<ref name=\"flora\">[http:\/\/www.zimbabweflora.co.zw\/speciesdata\/utilities\/utility-display-records-by-person.php?person_id=5 Flora of Zimbabwe] Flora of Zimbabwe: Records made by Bob Drummond<\/ref>\n\n===Fauna===\nHonde Valley is one of the premier birding destinations in Zimbabwe, offers a wide range of species difficult to find in most other parts of the region, other than in neighbouring Mozambique.

In addition there are other smaller un-metered water supply schemes that serve a number of villages and schools. The known smaller un-metered water supply schemes are Honde \u201cPovo\u201d Pipe Scheme, Chingaira Piped Scheme, St Columbus Secondary School, Sagambe Primary and Secondary School, Marige Water Project, Mahobo Piped Scheme and Mupenga Gravity Water Scheme.\n\n==Economy==\nSince the area is low-lying and hot it is an abundant [[tea]] and [[coffee]] growing area.

The accepted infobox is [[Template:Album infobox]]. [[User:Flowerparty|Flower]][[User talk:Flowerparty|party\u25a0]] 00:22, 24 September 2005 (UTC)\n\n:I was changing the infoboxes to that other format which I have seen used in many other band discographies on Wikipedia.  Personally I think they look much better and are easier to read than this standard Wiki infobox that you linked me to.  \nIf certain people on Wikipedia are going to attempt to enforce one style of album information box, you all have a lot of work to do in trying to crush the format I was using because lots of people  seem to prefer it.\n\nIncidentally, by just reverting to the previous edit, you deleted a lot of updates I made to information on the SY album entries other than the infoboxes.  Thanks a lot.   [[User:Carcassville|Carcassville]] 00:41, 24 September 2005 (UTC)\n\n::I'm sorry if I removed some details. I assumed you were just copying and pasting from old versions, but obviously you put a lot of work in. I've been through and changed things back where I could find them. I should also have pointed you to [[Wikipedia:Wikiproject Albums\/Needs infobox conversion]]. Admittedly, having two boxes in use isn't very helpful, but if they're going to be converted it should at least be going in one direction. Please keep up the good work.

Founded in 1932, it is one of the oldest non-sectarian [[philanthropic]] organisations in [[India]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|Sir Dorabji Tata}}\n\nLike his father, Sir Dorabji believed that one must make use of the wealth one had acquired for constructive purposes. So, in less than a year after his wife Meherbai's death, he donated all his wealth to the Trust, insisting that it must be used \"without any distinction of place, nationality or creed\", for the advancement of learning and research, the relief of distress and other charitable purposes. He died three months later.\n\nThe wealth that he turned over to the Trust comprised his substantial share holdings in Tata Sons, Indian Hotels and allied companies, his landed properties and 21 pieces of jewellery left by his wife, including the famous Jubilee Diamond, estimated then to be of the value of Rs 10 million. Today, these would be worth more than Rs 500 million.\n\n==Mission==\nAs the Trust got formed and the trustees deliberated on the policy aspects and finalised them, it decided to adopt a broad framework\u2014that it should undertake such projects, which are too large for individuals to handle and that each of these projects should have a genuine relevance to the welfare of the country.The Trust is mandated to:\n\n* Maintain and support schools, educational institutions and hospitals\n* Provide relief in distress caused by the elements of nature such as famine, pestilence, fire, tempest, flood, earthquake or any other calamity\n* Help advancement of learning in all its branches especially research work in medical and industrial problems\n* Offer financial aid to the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, by instituting professorships or lectureships or giving scholarships\n* Award fellowships in any branch of science or assist students to study abroad either by payment of lump sums grants or by payment of periodical sums\n* Give aid to any other charitable institutions or objects endowed by the settler in his lifetime, or by the grandfather, father or both of the settler.\n\n==Institutions of national importance==\nThe Trust is best known for promoting and setting up pioneering institutions of national importance.\n\n* [[Tata Institute of Social Sciences]], (1936)\n* [[Tata Memorial Hospital]], (1941)\n* [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]]-[[Mumbai]], (1945)\n* [[National Centre for the Performing Arts (India)|National Centre for the Performing Arts]], (1966)\n* [[The National Institute of Advanced Studies]], (1988)\n* [[Indian Institute of Science]]\n* The J. R. D. Tata Center for Ecotechnology, (1998)\n* The Sir Dorabji Tata Center for Research in Tropical Diseases, (2000)\n* The Tata Agricultural and Rural Training Cente for the Blind.\n* The International Institute of Demographic Studies.\n* Sir Dorabji Tata Centre for Research in Tropical Diseases at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, 1912\n* [[TIFR Centre for Applicable Mathematics]]- [[Bangalore]],\n* [[TIFR Hyderabad]],2011\n* [[Tata Medical center]], [[Rajarhat]], Kolkata (2011)\n \nEach of these institutions works in frontier areas of learning, research and knowledge dissemination. The ideas that have generated from these institutions and the people who have passed through their portals have enriched the various facets of India's development. Each of these institutions has produced a large number of social scientists, cancer specialists, nuclear scientists and distinguished institutional administrators who have all strived to make the country a power to reckon with in science and technology.\n\nIn the last decade, the Trust has also given shape to the National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bangalore and helped the Dr MS Swaminathan Research Foundation to start the JRD Tata Centre for Ecotechnology in Chennai.\n\nIn addition to these institutions, it has started with the assistance of the [[Royal Commonwealth Society for the Blind]], Asia's first institute for the training of the rural blind, The Tata Agricultural and Rural Training Centre for the Blind, and with the cooperation of the United Nations, the International Institute of Demographic Studies.\n\nThe Trust also helps various organisations and individuals with its grants. Its grants consist of Endowment Grants, grants to Non-Governmental Organisations and Small Grants, while Individual Grants are given to deserving individuals for medical, travel or educational purposes.\n\n==Under JRD Tata==\nWhat has helped the Trust in achieving its objectives has been the presence of distinguished personalities, most of them industry pioneers, on its board. Among them were [[JRD Tata]], chairman of the Tata Group, [[Ardeshir Dalal|Sir Ardeshir Dalal]], Dr John Matthai and [[Homi Mody|Sir Homi Mody]].\n\nThe involvement of JRD Tata in the affairs of Trust is not just incidental. Being a trustee since the Trust's inception, he held the position of chairman during the last 25 years of his life. His imprint is visible in the setting up of the [[Tata Memorial Hospital]], [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]], [[Tata Institute of Social Sciences]], [[National Institute of Advanced Studies]] and [[National Centre for the Performing Arts (India)|National Centre for the Performing Arts]]. His role was especially crucial in the establishment of the Tata Memorial Hospital. Right from its conceptual stages in early 1941, till it became a national centre for cancer research and treatment, JRD Tata was there all along to guide its destinies. In 1957, when the government of India's ministry of health temporarily took over the Tata Memorial Hospital, JRD Tata, along with Dr [[Homi J. Bhabha|Homi Bhabha]], the pioneer of India's nuclear energy programme, had the vision to foresee the role of radiation in cancer treatment and prevailed on the government to have the administrative control of the hospital transferred to the department of atomic energy in 1962.\n\nHe had also put his own money and efforts to set up, in 1944, the multipurpose JRD Tata Trust. Many years later, he established the JRD and Thelma J Tata Trust, selling part of his shares and an apartment in Mumbai. The Trust works to improve the lot of India's disadvantaged women.\n\n==Tata Memorial Hospital==\n{{main|Tata Memorial Hospital}}\n\nWhat is typical of the Trust is that after establishing pioneering institutions, giving them shape and stabilising them, the Trust has handed over their day-to-day running to the Government of India. Thus, The Tata Memorial Hospital is now under the government, run by the department of atomic energy.\n\n==Tata Institute of Fundamental Research==\n{{main|Tata Institute of Fundamental Research}}\n\nThe Tata Institute of Fundamental Research too has been handed over the Atomic Energy Commission. Tata Institute of Fundamental Research today is a Deemed University. \n\nIn the case of TISS and the TIFR, the chairmen of the boards have so far been the representatives of the Tata Trusts. The Trust is represented on the governing council of the Tata Memorial Hospital. However, the Trust still takes interest in these institutions and contributes its mite to their running.\n\nAs neither Sir Dorabji nor Sir Ratan had any children, their holdings could well have been fragmented and with them Tata Sons. The Trusts that Sir Dorabji and Sir Ratan set up gave to Tata Sons a cohesive and a continuing character over decades.\n\nThe Trust sanctioned institutional grants, as well as grants to private individuals. The total disbursal made by the Trust in the fiscal year 2003 - 2004 was [[Rupee|Rs]] 442.39 [[million]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sir Dorabji Tata]]\n\n==External links==\n* [http:\/\/www.tata.com\/0_our_commitment\/community_initiatives\/tata_trusts\/dorab_tata_trust.htm The Sir Dorabji Tata and Allied Trusts]\n* {{official website}}\n\n[[Category:1932 establishments in India]]\n[[Category:Non-profit organisations based in India]]\n[[Category:Tata institutions]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1932]]\n[[Category:Philanthropic organizations]]","timestamp":"20160410105419","user-timestamp":0},{"title":"User talk:Wasaymuzamil","content":"== A barnstar for you! ==\n\n{| style=\"background-color: #fdffe7; border: 1px solid #fceb92;\"\n|rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align: middle; padding: 5px;\" | [[File:Original Barnstar Hires.png|100px]]\n|style=\"font-size: x-large; padding: 3px 3px 0 3px; height: 1.5em;\" | '''The Original Barnstar'''\n|-\n|style=\"vertical-align: middle; padding: 3px;\" |  [[User:Wasaymuzamil|Wasaymuzamil]] ([[User talk:Wasaymuzamil#top|talk]]) 19:29, 1 July 2011 (UTC)\n|}","timestamp":"20160410105420","user-timestamp":0},{"title":"User:ColeHud\/sandbox","content":"{{User sandbox}}\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\nThis is Cole Hudson.

Well I think I know what you problem is, not warming-up or cooling down during activities. If you were to do warm-up and cool down activities you will be less likely break bones, and felling tired, and at the same time getting what your body needs.\n           To begin with, doing warm-up and cool down activates will make it less likely for you to break any bones. If you were about to run and the teacher tells you to stretch and you say you did, when actually you didn\u2019t you are putting yourself at risk to break a bone. When you stat running you trip and fall on your arm and you break it. You might have prevented this from happening if you were to stretch your arm. Also, if you break a bone you won\u2019t be able to participate in any sports. So most likely you will end up watching from the side lines.\n            Next, if you ever feel tired you have a problem. The problem is not enough sleep. If you plan to workout you would want to stretch to wake yourself up a little. If you skip stretching your muscles would get sore faster during the workout than they would be after it, and if you have an instructor you won\u2019t pay attention to him or her that well. Also, you were to do sports you would have slower reflexes than you would need.\n           Finally, if you were to do warm-up and cool down activities it will give you what you body needs. If you would do warm up and cool down activates it would increase your breathing and your hart rate. It would also increase your blood flowing to your heart. Also, it would cause your reflexes to be faster. It also prevents unnecessary stress being placed on your muscles, heart and lungs, which can occur if you exercise strenuously without a warm-up.\n             In conclusion, doing warm-up and cool down activities will probable prevent injuries that will affect you. There are many benefits of warming-up and cooling down before and after activities. Keep in mind that if you get hurt it is your fault not whose ever you are with, and don\u2019t forget to be responsible for your own actions.  \n Written by me on Blogger\n\nWeb Sites I used were\nhttps:\/\/www.blogger.com\/blogger.g?blogID=4691499749231917217#editor\/target=post;postID=243618374233252997;onPublishedMenu=posts;onClosedMenu=posts;postNum=0;src=postname","timestamp":"20160410105430","user-timestamp":"20150410105430"},{"title":"User talk:Katesokoloff","content":"== Managing a conflict of interest ==\n[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, Katesokoloff.

As an [[artist]], she is equally interested in solo piano performances, chamber music, composition and theatrical appearances in film, television and stage.\n\n===Acting career===\n\nIt was through the [[Goethe Institute]] that she arrived in Germany, where she completed her drama and music studies at the [[Berlin University of the Arts]] and participated on the side in various productions of the Independent \"Latin-American Theater Berlin\" under the direction of her fellow countryman [[Emilio Schechtmann]].\n\nAfter a few on-screen appearances she decided to perfect the art of [[film]] and [[TV]] [[acting]] and went to Los Angeles in 1998 to study with some of the leading acting coaches such as M. K. Lewis and Margie Harber, among others.

Beasley was gazetted to the [[Royal Artillery]] in 1896. He served in India, Burma and China, and took part in the [[Battle of Peking|Relief of Peking]] after the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. He served in [[World War I|WWI]] on the staff of the [[I Anzac Corps|Anzac Corps]]. He was thrice [[mentioned in despatches]] and awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO). After the war he served in Germany on the Disarmament Commission. He was an interpreter in French, German and [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]].<ref>Phillips, Hubert. 1934. [Biography of Beasley].

Reprinted in Hasenson 2004, p169-70.<\/ref>\n\n[[Image:Popspractice@72.jpg|thumb|280 px| Beasley during a practice match at [[Grosvenor House Hotel|Grosvenor House]], before the 1933 Schwab Cup match vs Culbertson. Right is probably [[Terence Reese]].]]\n\nPops had played all forms of bridge from the days of [[Bridge Whist|bridge\u2013whist]] and [[auction bridge]]. He wrote his first book on this game in 1906, ''London Bridge'', which \"started the bridge craze in all the fashionable clubs of that day\" [Beasley]. Like many of the early contract bridge players, he had been an expert auction bridge player in the 1920s. In domestic bridge he was a leading organiser. He had been a member of Almacks club since 1901, and later was a co-founder and Chairman of two leading London card clubs \u2013 Crockford's (in [[St James's Street]]) and the Hamilton Club (in [[Hamilton Place, London|Hamilton Place]]). He was also a leading player in the 1930s, winning the [[Gold Cup (bridge)|Gold Cup]] in 1933, and playing in several international events. He was an author and bridge columnist, and the originator of a bidding system named after him.<ref>\nBeasley, H.M. 1935. ''The Beasley System of Contract Bridge''. Associated Newspapers Ltd, London.<\/ref>\n\n:\"Pops was a brilliant player and a great psychologist. In his time he won most of the major tournaments and he captained England on numerous occasions\". \u2013Ewart Kempson<ref>Kempson, Ewart. 1949. \"Colonel Henry Mountifort Beasley DSO\". Obituary. Reprinted in Hasenson 2004, p169.<\/ref>\n\nIn bidding, Beasley adopted many of Culbertson's ideas, but was displeased with the strong twos and their negative response of two no trumps. As a result, so he claimed, he was the inventor (in 1936) of the artificial strong two clubs opening bid with its negative response two diamonds.<ref>Beasley, H.M. 1948. \"Recollections of a pioneer bridge player\". ''Contract Bridge Journal''. Reprinted in Hasenson 2004.<\/ref> For many years all the British bidding systems used this method of dealing with strong hands: [[Acol]] (both standard and Benjaminised), CAB, Two Clubs and Baron systems all used it. However, it is fair to mention that others have also claimed authorship of this fruitful idea.\n\n==Matches vs Culbertson==\nBeasley's bridge team played two matches against the formidable [[Ely Culbertson|Culbertson]] team, losing both, but helping to develop the game in Britain.<ref>Francis, Truscott, and Francis, eds. 2001. ''[[The Official Encyclopedia of Bridge]]''. 6th ed, ACBL.<\/ref>\n\nThe first match, Crockford's v. Culbertson, took place in 1930, after the [[Walter Buller (bridge)|Buller]]\u2013[[Ely Culbertson|Culbertson]] match. The Crockford's team was Beasley, Sir Guy Domville (popular society and sporting figure), George Morris and Captain Hogg. Culbertson won the match over 200 deals by 4,905 points (total points scoring).<ref>Clay, J. 1985. ''Culbertson: the man who made contract bridge''. Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London. p106.<\/ref>\n\n[[Image:Beasley_v_Culbertson_76_KB.jpg|thumb|340 px|left| At table, from left: [[Ely Culbertson]], Lady [[Doris Rhodes]], referee Col GGJ Walshe, Josephine Culbertson, Pops Beasley.

Gottlieb]], George Morris, referee Mr Mundy, Theodore Lightner, Percy Tabbush. Behind left, Hubert Phillips; second right, Doris Rhodes.]]\n\nThe second match, for the Schwab trophy in 1933, was a more significant event, preceded by the usual brilliant Culbertson publicity. Played at [[Selfridges]], it was widely reported in the press and on newsreel, and was attended by many spectators. A large periscope was used so that spectators outside the playing-room could glimpse the players. Play could also be followed on a massive electrical scoreboard (\"the forerunner to Bridgerama\")<ref>Reese, Terence. 1977. ''Bridge at the Top''. Faber, London. p19.<\/ref> in the Palm Court area. The most common partnerships were: Britain: Beasley & Sir Guy Domville; George Morris & Percy Tabbush; Lady [[Doris Rhodes]] & Graham Mathieson. America: Ely & Josephine Culbertson; Theodore Lightner & Michael Gottlieb. Both teams sometimes paired the players differently.\n\nGeorge Morris and Percy Tabbush were an interesting pair: according to Reese, Morris was \"a famous gambler at every card game, and an athlete; he had made a Channel-swimming attempt and played marathon golf for big stakes. His health failed and he was a pitiable sight in later years. Tabbush followed a course that is not common amongst bridge players: he joined a religious sect and turned his back on the '[[Devil]]'s playthings'.\" <ref>Reese, 1977, p19. Tabbush joined the [[Exclusive Brethren]], a subset of the [[Plymouth Brethren]], as told in his tract ''An expert card-player's great experience''.<\/ref>\n\nMathieson's part in the match was curtailed when he fell through a glass roof, to be rescued swinging from a girder above a 40-foot drop! The Culbertson team won by the decisive, but not overwhelming, margin of 10,900 points (total points scoring). [[Hubert Phillips]], writing in the ''[[News Chronicle]]'', put the reasons as superior teamwork, avoidance of unnecessary risks when vulnerable, and greater precision in slam-bidding.<ref>Clay, ''Culbertson'' p158<\/ref> The match was analysed in three books, and had a considerable effect on bidding methods in Britain and elsewhere.<ref>Beasley H.M. 1933.

The government has the names in sequence for a reason. The reason is that North Port (which I honestly never heard of) is larger than Sarasota, which, in turn, is larger than Bradenton. I sympathize with the previous change, but reality is reality. We need to use official names unless a consensus is reached for some other reason.\n\nNote that on the other coast, Melbourne-Cocoa-Titusville MSA was renamed to Palm Bay-Melbourne-Titusville MSA because Palm Bay had become the largest in the area, and Cocoa was simply dropped! [[User:Student7|Student7]] ([[User talk:Student7|talk]]) 15:42, 8 August 2013 (UTC)\n\n:The government's naming reasons need not be ours, and it is inappropriate of you to suggest that editors who think a different name is more appropriate are irresponsible.  I'm in favor of [[Sarasota metropolitan area]]; I think others are as well.  And if we go with your title, there's still no reason to capitalize \"Metropolitan Area\".  [[User:Dicklyon|Dicklyon]] ([[User talk:Dicklyon|talk]]) 15:51, 8 August 2013 (UTC)\n\n::Agreed.  Per [[WP:COMMONNAME]]: \"Wikipedia does not necessarily use the subject's \"official\" name as an article title; it prefers to use the name that is most frequently used to refer to the subject in English-language reliable sources\" [[User:Gamaliel|<font color=\"DarkGreen\">Gamaliel<\/font>]] <small>([[User talk:Gamaliel|<font color=\"DarkGreen\">talk<\/font>]])<\/small> 16:01, 8 August 2013 (UTC)\n:::Seems [[WP:SPAM]]my. Why else change the correct name? Because a C-of-C objects? pov. \n:::More than that, this article has been more or less correctly named since Horologium did so in May of 2011. No real cause ([[WP:BURDEN]]) has been advanced for altering it. [[User:Student7|Student7]] ([[User talk:Student7|talk]]) 20:48, 13 August 2013 (UTC)\n\n:While indeed North Port is the largest ''city'' in the metro area, there's no real dispute that Sarasota is far more of an economic\/political\/etc. center than North Port is. I think the Herald-Tribune editorial explains it well. The City of Sarasota is a relatively small chunk of what comprises \"Sarasota\"\u2014unincorporated census-designated places like \"[[Bee Ridge, Florida|Bee Ridge]]\", \"[[Fruitville, Florida|Fruitville]]\", \"[[Ridge Wood Heights, Florida]]\" are more or less creations of census fiction and carry Sarasota addresses and are locally considered to be part of Sarasota even though they are not in fact legally part of the city proper. Unincorporated Sarasota outpopulates the City of Sarasota and it's been this way for a long time. North Port's advantageous municipal boundaries are the sole reason for its larger population size. If the City of Sarasota's boundaries were even 25% bigger (a political impossibility) the city proper would probably leave North Port in the dust population-wise.

His memoirs were titled ''Never a Normal Man''.\n\n==Early life==\nFarson was born in [[Kensington]], west London, the son of American journalist [[Negley Farson]]; his childhood was mostly divided between Britain and North America. He visited Germany with his father while Negley was reporting on the [[Nazi]] regime, and was patted on the head by [[Adolf Hitler]], who described him as a \"good [[Aryan]] boy\".{{CN|date=August 2015}} He briefly attended the British public school [[Wellington College (Berkshire)|Wellington College]], whose militaristic regime was not to his taste; Farson had become intensely aware of his [[homosexuality]], which would sporadically cause him great emotional strain. As a teenager he worked as a parliamentary correspondent, and was pursued in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] by the Labour [[Member of Parliament]] [[Tom Driberg]].\n\n==1950s==\nFarson joined [[Associated-Rediffusion]], the first British commercial television company, in the mid-1950s. Here he took risks that few television interviewers (certainly not those employed at the conservative [[BBC]]) would then dare to take. In his series ''[[Out of Step (TV series)|Out of Step]]'' (1957) and ''People in Trouble'' (1958) \u2013 never shown at the same time throughout the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, but much repeated in various regions well into the early 1960s \u2013 he dealt with issues of social exclusion and alienation that most of the media at the time preferred to sweep under the carpet. The best remembered editions of these series are the ''Out of Step'' programme on [[nudism]] (the term \"naturism\" had yet to become commonplace), which claimed to show the first naked woman on British television, and the ''People in Trouble'' programme on mixed marriages (a highly sensitive issue at the time as post-war immigrants tentatively began to integrate into British life). They were repeated in 1982 on [[Channel 4]].\n\nAnother 1958 Farson series, entitled ''Keeping in Step'', looked at establishment institutions such as public schools from a distinctly more distanced perspective than that seen on virtually all BBC programmes (and even most other Associated-Rediffusion programmes) of the time.  A regular guest on Farson's programmes at this stage was [[James Wentworth Day]], a [[reactionary]] British writer of the [[Agrarian Right]] school, who commented in the programme about mixed marriages, referring to mixed-race children as \"coffee-coloured little imps\" and argued that black people must be less \"civilised\" than white people because \"a couple of generations ago they were eating each other\" (Wentworth Day's remarks were featured in [[Victor Lewis-Smith]]'s series ''Buygones'' and ''[[TV Offal]]'').  Farson would usually respond to these diatribes with a polite statement along the lines of \"I couldn't disagree with you more, but at least you do say what you really feel\".\n\nHowever, Wentworth Day's appearances came to an end when he claimed that all homosexuals should be hanged.{{CN|date=August 2015}} Farson insisted that the episode of ''People in Trouble'' in which Wentworth Day had made those remarks \u2013 concerning [[transvestism]] \u2013 was scrapped before it had been completed. He publicly insisted that the [[Independent Television Authority]] would ban it; in reality Farson was terrified that Wentworth Day would attempt to bring him to trial. After this, Farson immediately froze Wentworth Day out of his life and his programmes.\n\nFarson's broadcasting career, however, continued to flourish.{{CN|date=August 2015}} ''Farson's Guide to the British'' (1959\u20131960) took a critical eye at a nation in transition and was the first public expression of his long-term quest for the true identity of [[Jack the Ripper]].  Other series included ''Farson in Australia'' (1961) and ''Dan Farson Meets ...'' (1962), which usually featured popular singers of the time.  The one-off programme ''Beat City'' (1963) was an atmospheric evocation of the [[Liverpool]] scene which had given birth to [[The Beatles]] and the [[sociology|sociological]] factors which had brought it into being. In 1960, he helmed ''Living For Kicks'', a documentary about the frustrations and uncertainties of British teenagers in the post-[[Elvis Presley|Elvis]], pre-Beatles era.\n\nThe ''[[Daily Sketch]]'', a tabloid paper then owned by [[Associated Newspapers]] (who were the \"Associated\" in Associated-Rediffusion, although they had sold their stake in the company by this time), led the chorus of revulsion to the documentary. The ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' responded with a defence of British teenagers; a considerable war of words then developed between the two papers, with the ''Mirror'''s well-remembered TV commercials (\"The ''Daily Mirror'' backs the young!\") representing its position on the matter.\n\n==1960s==\nIn 1962, Farson made a documentary for Associated-Rediffusion about pub entertainment in the [[East End of London]] where he lived, called ''Time Gentlemen Please'' (this led directly to the company's later series ''[[Stars and Garters]]'', with which Farson was not, however, personally involved).{{CN|date=August 2015}}  Soon after this he bought a pub, ''The Waterman's Arms'', in the East End with the explicit intent of reviving old-time [[music hall]], but this failed and the money he lost would have bought a row of houses at the time (1963).  \n\nBy the end of 1964 he had resigned from Associated-Rediffusion (by then renamed Rediffusion London) and would keep a lower public profile for the rest of his life.  He moved from London to live in his parents' house in [[Devon]], but continued to visit the pubs and drinking clubs of London's Soho on a regular basis.\n\n==1970s to 1990s==\nHe remained, however, a prolific author and a prominent figure in the art world.{{CN|date=August 2015}} He produced several volumes of memoirs.  ''Soho in the Fifties'' recalled his participation in London's west end Bohemia.  ''Limehouse Days'' (1991) recalled his disastrous East End pub venture.  These and other books were illustrated with his own photographs.\n\nHe wrote a number of studies of artists and authors. ''The Man Who Wrote Dracula'' (1975) was a life of his grand-uncle, [[Bram Stoker]].  While living at his father's old house in North Devon he established a close friendship with the writer [[Henry Williamson]] (an Agrarian Right ally of James Wentworth Day); Farson paid tribute to Williamson with a book entitled ''Henry: An Appreciation of Henry Williamson'' published in 1982, five years after Williamson's death. ''Sacred Monsters'' (1988), was a collection of essays on artists and writers he had known.\n\nFarson also wrote the authorised biography of his friend, the painter [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]] (''The Gilded Gutter Life of Francis Bacon'' (1994) \u2013 at Bacon's insistence this was not published until after the artist's death). The 1998 film ''[[Love Is the Devil: Study for a Portrait of Francis Bacon]]'' starring [[Derek Jacobi]] and [[Daniel Craig]] draws heavily on the book, showing Farson (played by [[Adrian Scarborough]]) socialising with Bacon, as well as interviewing him on television. The film is dedicated to him.\n\nHis last book was a \"portrait\" of the artists [[Gilbert and George]], published posthumously in 1999 (he had already, in 1991, published an informal account of a trip he took with them to Moscow). He devised the Channel 4 art quiz ''Gallery'' and he worked as TV critic and, later, art critic for ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' (oddly, another Associated Newspapers title).\n \nHe also wrote travel books, including ''A Traveller in Turkey'', ''The Independent Traveller's guide to Turkey'' and ''A Dry Ship to the Mountains (Down the Volga and Across the Caucasus in My Father's Footsteps)'', the book version of the children's TV series ''[[The Clifton House Mystery]]'' (produced by [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]] West for ITV in 1978), and an appreciation of \"[[Marie Lloyd]] and music hall\" and a recollection of \"[[Soho]] in the Fifties\" (a time and a place in which he had found one of his few natural homes).\n\n==Final years==\nHis father had been an alcoholic, and Farson himself had been a heavy drinker since his Bohemian days in Soho in the 1950s. In later years, the effects of [[alcoholism]] became more apparent. He knew he was dying of [[cancer]] in March 1997, when his self-deprecating autobiography, ''Never A Normal Man'' (a phrase actually used to describe his father, not himself) was published.  He was hungover when he appeared on the [[BBC Radio 4]] programme ''Midweek'' to promote this book.{{CN|date=August 2015}}\n\nHe died at his father's house in [[Devon]] on 27 November 1997.<ref>[http:\/\/ftvdb.bfi.org.uk\/sift\/individual\/165272 BFI | Film & TV Database | FARSON, Daniel<!-- Bot generated title -->]<\/ref><ref>Daniel Farson 'The Gilded Gutter Life of Francis Bacon'1993<\/ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb name|0268588}}\n* [http:\/\/www.transdiffusion.org\/emc\/tvheroes\/daniel_farson.php Article on Farson and his television work]\n* [http:\/\/www.screenonline.org.uk\/people\/id\/745404\/index.html Article on Farson from a British Film Institute site]\n* [http:\/\/www.francis-bacon.cx\/articles\/bacon-news-farson.html Farson's obituary from ''The Daily Telegraph'']\n* [http:\/\/findarticles.com\/p\/articles\/mi_qa3724\/is_199703\/ai_n8779322 Review of Farson's autobiography from ''The Spectator'']\n* [http:\/\/www.findarticles.com\/p\/articles\/mi_qn4158\/is_19970406\/ai_n14117561 Review of Farson's autobiography from ''The Independent on Sunday'']\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Farson, Daniel}}\n[[Category:1927 births]]\n[[Category:1997 deaths]]\n[[Category:Daily Mail journalists]]\n[[Category:English non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:English television presenters]]\n[[Category:English male journalists]]\n[[Category:English art critics]]\n[[Category:Gay writers]]\n[[Category:LGBT writers from England]]\n[[Category:People educated at Wellington College, Berkshire]]\n[[Category:English male writers]]","timestamp":"20160410105452","user-timestamp":"20150410105452"},{"title":"User talk:217.128.216.210","content":"","timestamp":"20160410105452","user-timestamp":"20150410105452"},{"title":"User talk:Rantng","content":"\n\n==Speedy deletion of [[:Deden Zaenudin]]==\n[[Image:Ambox warning_pn.svg|48px|left]] A tag has been placed on [[:Deden Zaenudin]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia.

It was intended to inform Soviet citizens about American life.<ref>Creghton Peet: \"Russian 'Amerika,' a Magazine about U. S. for Soviet Citizens\", ''College Art Journal, Vol. 11, No. 1 (Autumn, 1951), pp. 17-20.<\/ref> ''Amerika'' was distinguished among other Soviet publications by its high-grade paper, bright printing and numerous photos. The magazine has been described as \"polite propaganda\" and featured high-quality photography and articles about everyday life in the United States, as well as profiles of famous American people and institutions.<ref>Walter L. Hixson: ''Parting the Curtain: Propaganda, Culture, and the Cold War, 1945-1961'' (McMillan, 1997), p. 118.<\/ref> Later it briefly existed as '''''America Illustrated'''''. 454 issues in total were published.\n\n==History==\nIn 1944 the State Department began circulating 10,000 copies in the Soviet Union. The magazine was instantly popular and sold out all of its copies virtually overnight.  In June 1947, the Soviet Union authorized an increase to 50,000 copies.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} By the late 1940s, the State Department began to feel that radio and the [[Voice of America]] would be  more effective propaganda tools and, in 1952, publication of ''Amerika'' was suspended.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} However, in 1956, the American and Soviet governments agreed to exchange magazines and ''Amerika'' was reborn and published in return for distribution of ''[[Russian Life|The USSR]]'' in the United States.<{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} The magazine was again an immediate success, selling out quickly.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} The goal, as explained in the first issue, was that \"the Soviet reader could see the many-sided American life, reflected in it.\"\n\nIn his study of the propaganda of the era, University of Akron history professor Walter L. Hixson writes that ''Amerika'' was wildly popular among Soviet readers and notes that long lines would form when the magazine went on sale.  Because the magazine sparked discussion among the Soviet intelligentsia and because each issue was widely shared, ''Amerika'' had impact and influence beyond its circulation of 50,000.  The U.S. government felt that the magazine made a valuable contribution to better understanding of America by the Soviet people and was an effective counterpart to Soviet propaganda.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nSample articles published in ''Amerika'' include:\n\n*  A Skyscraper\u2019s Walls Built in One Day, a photo-story showing how the walls of a tower block on Park Avenue, New York were completed in a period of just 10 hours\n*  A Young Farmer Harvests 1,165 Poods (1 [[pood]] = approx 36&nbsp;lbs) of Corn from One Hectare of Land\n*  Examples of Cheap Furniture, showing home furnishings all of which were cheaper than $25\n*  Supermarkets \u2013 A New Era in Shopping\n*  The Automobile \u2013 Inside and Outside\n*  The War on Polio\n*  A Prosthetic Surgeon\n*  A School Where Children Learn the Science of Life\n*  A School in the Open Air\n*  How to Make a Dress Simply in One Day\n*  How to Score Points in Basketball\n*  America's 1956 Automobiles\n*  Fashions Under Twenty Dollars\n*  Best Dressed College Girls\n*  Television for the Millions\n*  Facts About the U.S.: The Negro Today\n*  Numerous articles about African-American jazz musicians\n*  Numerous articles about American artists<ref>Mike O\u2019Mahony: ''Juvenile delinquency and art in Amerika'', Art On The Line, 2004\/1 (1)<\/ref><ref>Hixson, p.118<\/ref>\n\nThe magazine ceased publication in October 1994.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n\"Amerika\" is housed at many major research libraries in the U.S. Full runs of the Russian- and Polish-language editions, as well as translations of the articles and records related to their distribution, are available at the [[National Archives and Records Administration]]'s Archives II facility in College Park, MD.\n\n==Notable contributors==\nFrom 1946 until 1952, ''Amerika'' was edited by [[Marion K.

However, as QRT is not a cold fusion theory, then it doesn\u2019t need to be verified.\n\n3-  So, one can ask:  \u201cThen what is shown in the article [[Cold fusion theories]]?\u201d\n:The article shows the following '''facts: '''\n\n::3.1- There is not yet a successfull cold fusion theory.

If the theory does not satisfy it, it cannot be acceptable.  This is a fact, and it is '''verified'''.\n\n::3.3-  The '''fundamental requirement''' cannot be reached from the current foundations of Quantum Mechanics This is a fact, and it is '''verifiable'''.  As this item 3.3 is '''verified''', then are also '''verified''' the next items 3.3.1 and 3.3.2:\n\n::::3.3.1-  Therefore if a cold fusion theory is developed from the current foundations of QM, such theory has no chance to be successful.\n\n::::3.3.2-  In consequence of 3.3.1 we realize that any candidate to be a cold fusion theory must be developed from some new foundations missing yet in Quantum Mechanics.  They must be incorporated to QM, in order to become viable a candidate to be a cold fusion theory.\n\n::3.4- The cold fusion theorists do not know what are those new foundations missing in QM.  But as these new foundations are indispensable for the success of a cold fusion theory, it means that there is no way to develop a successful theory by keeping the current method of theoretical research addopted by the theorists.  This is a fact, and it is '''verified''.\n\n4- The article [[Cold fusion theories]] shows that it is possible to satisfy the '''fundamental requirement''' by addopting the following theoretical steps:\n\n::4.1- By considering the electron\u2019s zitterbewegung as a helical trajectory.\n\n::4.2- The article exhibits a link to the paper '''Anomalous Mass of the Neutron''', where it a calculation proves that the '''fundamental requirement''' can be satisfied by considering the zitterbewegung hypothesis.\n\nThe items 4.1 and 4.2 are '''verified''' by reading the article [[Cold fusion theories]].\n\n\n::::::::'''Conclusions: ''' \n:::::::::::1-  The article [[Cold fusion theories]] shows the following '''verified''' fact:  it is possible to satisfy theoretically the '''fundamental requirement''' indispensable to any cold fustion theory, by addopting the new foundations proposed in Quantum Ring Theory, which must be incorporated to Quantum Mechanics, in order to become viable the development of a successful cold fusion theory.\n\n::::::::::: 2-  '''Therefore it makes no sense to allege that the article [[Cold fusion Theories]] has \u201cunverified claims\u201d '''\n\n[[User:W.GUGLINSKI|W.GUGLINSKI]] 00:50, 13 November 2007 (UTC)\n\n....................................................................................................................\n\n::::::::''' SECOND ALLEGATION: '''\n::::::::*''' This article or section may contain original research'''\n\nThe article does not propose a theory on cold fusion.

I'm a software engineer and I often hear thrashing to mean what happens when engineers are switching between projects far too often.  Since the term has its roots in our field, is it exclusive to us, or does it exist in other fields?  Should it be mentioned here?\n\n[[User:CSZero|CSZero]] 22:10, 29 October 2006 (UTC)\n\n\n\n\nIMHO, an animation of \"thrashing\" would be worth \"a million\" words. (Since \"a picture is worth a 1000 words.\" An animation is a ~1000 pictures, thus(1000X1000=1,000,000) \"a million\" words.)\n\n== Permaswap ==\n\nI'd like to see the term \"permaswap\" added to this article. It's a common way to describe the situation where the system is almost completely stalled, and the disk is going crazy. See for instance this link [http:\/\/www.belightsoft.com\/forum\/viewtopic.php?pid=2248] or just do a Google search for the term. There are lots of references, but the term doesn't exist in Wikipedia. [[User:Leifbk|leifbk]] 09:26, 5 October 2007 (UTC)\n\n\n== Practical considerations ==\nThe advice to increase memory is in principle a good one, though on some systems I believe that this will not always solve the problem, depending on what programs are used. For example, running a virus checker over a disc drive may result in any caches being flushed, and any other program will slow down to snail's pace. This seems to be quite common in systems such as Windows XP. This is hinted at in the article, but specific details are not given. Programs which look at significant parts of storage discs, or which create large files themselves (e.g sound, video recorders), and programs which use large temporary memory or files (e.g photo manipulation programs) are more likely to cause thrashing problems than programs which only use a small amount of memory, and few files. [[User:David Martland|David Martland]] 16:00, 17 October 2007 (UTC)\n\n: I agree with your main point -- scanning the entire disk will always make the hard-drive light stay constantly on for a long time and slow down other programs, just like a thrashing system, no matter how much memory you put in.\n: I have seen other programs \"slow down to a snail's pace\" -- but other processes seem to run only slightly slower than normal if the virus checker is given a lower \"priority\" (using \"[[renice]]\" or the \"[[Windows Task Manager]]\"). Can\/should I add this to the \"user can do\" list? Or would that violate [[WP:NOR]] and\/or [[WP:NOTHOWTO]] ?\n: Yes, scanning over data too large to fit into RAM -- if one uses the LRU [[page replacement algorithm]] -- will flush caches and fill them with useless pages -- pages that will never be read again, or at least not for a very long time.\n: However, better page replacement algorithms such as CLOCK-pro and [[adaptive replacement cache]] (ARC) are designed to work better than LRU by recognizing such \"streaming\" behavior, so they can avoid flushing other pages that will soon be needed again. Although the streaming data is technically \"less recently used\" than these other pages, these better page replacement algorithms (unlike LRU) use only a few page frames to hold streaming data, and all other pages in the cache are *not* flushed. --[[Special:Contributions\/68.0.124.33|68.0.124.33]] ([[User talk:68.0.124.33|talk]]) 01:36, 3 April 2009 (UTC)\n\n== Oh, man, the definition is so far off the mark! ==\n\n<blockquote>\"In computer science, thrash (verb) is the term used to describe a degenerate situation on a computer where increasing resources are used to do a decreasing amount of work.\"<\/blockquote>\n\nA thrash is when the same data is being repeatedly passed back and forth between two storage devices.  Not some vague reference to over-consumption of any old resource.\n\nThis results in only one extra system resource being consumed - time.  I guess the side effect of consuming the data channel between the two storage devices for this unwanted duration can be considered a resource too.\n\nAnd when one storage device is faster then it effectively has to slow down to match the slower storage, consuming even more time.\n\n[[User:Evanh|Evanh]] ([[User talk:Evanh|talk]]) 13:51, 28 November 2009 (UTC)\ngds  <span style=\"font-size: smaller;\" class=\"autosigned\">\u2014Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions\/116.72.180.148|116.72.180.148]] ([[User talk:116.72.180.148|talk]]) 09:25, 28 February 2011 (UTC)<\/span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\n\n== Disk threshing ==\n\nIn the UK, it seems that 'Threshing' is the correct spelling according to the OCR exam board (Computing).

It certainly isn't normal usage in the UK.  The only people who use this term are the examiners on the OCR exam board.  It is very hard to explain this, especially as they use the term consistently throughout their documentation and also in exam questions.  It is not the only aspect of the OCR syllabus that is problematic.  There are a number of places where the examiners use terms imprecisely or incorrectly.

Moriarty is a criminal mastermind whom Holmes describes as the \"[[Napoleon]] of crime\". Doyle lifted the phrase from a Scotland Yard inspector who was referring to [[Adam Worth]], a real-life criminal mastermind and one of the individuals upon whom the character of Moriarty was based. The character was introduced primarily as a narrative device to enable Conan Doyle to kill Sherlock Holmes, and only featured directly in two of the Sherlock Holmes stories. However, in more recent derivative work he has been given a greater prominence and treated as Holmes' [[archenemy]].\n\n==Appearances in works==\nMoriarty's first and only appearance occurred in ''[[The Adventure of the Final Problem]]'', in which Holmes, on the verge of delivering a fatal blow to Moriarty's criminal ring, is forced to flee to continental Europe to escape Moriarty's retribution. The criminal mastermind follows, and the pursuit ends on top of the [[Reichenbach Falls]], an encounter that apparently ends with both Holmes and Moriarty falling to their deaths. In this story, Moriarty is introduced as a crime lord who protects nearly all of the criminals of England in exchange for their obedience and a share in their profits. Holmes, by his own account, was originally led to Moriarty by his perception that many of the crimes he investigated were not isolated incidents, but instead the machinations of a vast and subtle criminal ring.\n\nMoriarty plays a direct role in only one other Holmes story, ''[[The Valley of Fear]]'', set before \"The Final Problem\" but written afterwards. In ''The Valley of Fear'', Holmes attempts to prevent Moriarty's agents from committing a murder. In an episode in which Moriarty is being interviewed by a policeman, a painting by [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] is described as hanging on the wall; Holmes remarks on another work by the same painter to show it could not have been purchased on a professor's salary. The work referred to is ''La jeune fille \u00e0 l'agneau''; some commentators<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news|url=http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/books\/97\/08\/24\/reviews\/970824.24mortimt.html|title=To Catch a Thief|author=John Mortimer|publisher=The New York Times|date=24 August 1997}}. A review of ''THE NAPOLEON OF CRIME&nbsp;\u2014 The Life and Times of Adam Worth, Master Thief'' by Ben Macintyre<\/ref> have described this as a pun by Conan Doyle on the ''[[Thomas Agnew and Sons]]'' art gallery, which had a famous painting<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.damforstmuseum.org\/images\/stolen\/gainsborough_duchess.jpg|title=A portrait of Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire by Thomas Gainsborough}}<\/ref> stolen by [[Adam Worth]], but were unable to prove the claim.<ref name=\"NYT\"\/>\n\nHolmes mentions Moriarty reminiscently in five other stories: ''[[The Adventure of the Empty House]]'' (the immediate sequel to ''The Final Problem''), ''[[The Adventure of the Norwood Builder]]'', ''[[The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter]]'', ''[[The Adventure of the Illustrious Client]]'', and ''[[His Last Bow (story)|His Last Bow]]''.  More obliquely, a 1908 mystery by Conan Doyle that was named \"[[The Lost Special]]\" features a criminal [[genius]] who could be Moriarty and a detective who could be Holmes, although neither is mentioned by name. {{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n[[Doctor Watson]], even when narrating, never meets Moriarty (only getting distant glimpses of him in ''The Final Problem''), and relies upon Holmes to relate accounts of the detective's feud with the criminal. Conan Doyle is inconsistent on Watson's familiarity with Moriarty. In \"The Final Problem\", Watson tells Holmes he has never heard of Moriarty, while in ''The Valley of Fear'', set earlier on, Watson already knows of him as \"the famous scientific criminal\".\n\nIn ''The Empty House'', Holmes states that Moriarty had commissioned a powerful [[air gun]] from a blind German mechanic surnamed von Herder, which was used by Moriarty's employee\/acolyte [[Colonel Sebastian Moran|Colonel Moran]]. It closely resembled a cane, allowing for easy concealment, was capable of firing revolver bullets at long range, and made very little noise when fired, making it ideal for [[sniping]]. Moriarty also has a marked preference for organising \"accidents\". His attempts to kill Holmes include falling masonry and a speeding horse-drawn van. He is also responsible for [[Stage management|stage-managing]] the death of Birdy Edwards.<ref>Epilogue, ''The Valley of Fear''.<\/ref>\n\n==Personality==\nMoriarty is extremely intelligent, cunning, calculative and manipulative. He is also ruthless, shown by his steadfast vow to Sherlock Holmes that \"if (Holmes) was clever enough to bring destruction down upon me (Moriarty), then I shall do as much for you\". Moriarty is categorised by Holmes as an extremely powerful criminal mastermind who is purely adept at committing any atrocity to perfection without losing any sleep on it. It is stated in ''The House of Silk'' that Moriarty does not directly participate in the activities he plans, but he only 'orchestrates' the events.\n\nHolmes described Moriarty as follows: {{quote|He is a man of good birth and excellent education, endowed by nature with a phenomenal mathematical faculty. At the age of twenty-one he wrote [[A Treatise on the Binomial Theorem|a treatise upon the binomial theorem]] which has had a European vogue. On the strength of it, he won the mathematical [[Chair (academic)|chair]] at one of our smaller universities, and had, to all appearances, a most brilliant career before him. But the man had hereditary tendencies of the most diabolical kind. A criminal strain ran in his blood, which, instead of being modified, was increased and rendered infinitely more dangerous by his extraordinary mental powers. Dark rumours gathered round him in the University town, and eventually he was compelled to resign his chair and come down to London. He is the Napoleon of crime, Watson. He is the organiser of half that is evil and of nearly all that is undetected in this great city...|Holmes, \"The Final Problem\"}}\n\nHolmes echoes and expounds this sentiment in ''The Valley of Fear'' stating: {{quote|But in calling Moriarty a criminal you are uttering libel in the eyes of the law\u2014and there lie the glory and the wonder of it! The greatest schemer of all time, the organizer of every devilry, the controlling brain of the underworld, a brain which might have made or marred the destiny of nations\u2014that\u2019s the man! But so aloof is he from general suspicion, so immune from criticism, so admirable in his management and self-effacement, that for those very words that you have uttered he could hale you to a court and emerge with your year\u2019s pension as a solatium for his wounded character. Is he not the celebrated author of ''[[The Dynamics of an Asteroid]]'', a book which ascends to such rarefied heights of pure mathematics that it is said that there was no man in the scientific press capable of criticizing it? Is this a man to traduce? Foulmouthed doctor and slandered professor\u2014such would be your respective roles!

Moriarty appeared in only two books as the author  felt having him constantly escape would discredit Holmes, and would be less satisfying. Eventually, however, public pressure and financial troubles impelled Doyle to bring Holmes back.<ref>{{cite web|title=Case Book: Doyle vs. Holmes|url=http:\/\/www.pbs.org\/wgbh\/mystery\/essays\/doylevholmes.html|first=Ron|last=Miller|publisher=PBS}}<\/ref>\n\n==Moriarty's personal history==\n\"[[Moriarty (name)|Moriarty]]\" is an ancient [[Irish name]]<ref>{{cite book|author=Daniel Jones|author2= A.C.

In his first appearance in \"[[The Final Problem]]\", Moriarty is referred to as \"Professor Moriarty\" \u2014 no forename is mentioned. Watson does, however, refer to the name of another family member when he writes of \"the recent letters in which Colonel James Moriarty defends the memory of his brother\". In \"[[The Adventure of the Empty House]]\", Holmes refers to Moriarty on one occasion as \"Professor James Moriarty\". This is the only time Moriarty is given a first name, and oddly, it is the same as that of his purported brother; to wit ''[[The Valley of Fear]]'' (written after the preceding two stories, but set earlier), Holmes says of Professor Moriarty: \"He is unmarried. His younger brother is a [[station master]] in the west of England.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Sherlock Holmes: The Complete Novels and Stories, Volume 2|author=Sir Arthur Conan Doyle|publisher=Random House}}, p. 175.<\/ref>\n\n==Simon Newcomb and other real-world role models==\n[[File:Simon Newcomb 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Simon Newcomb]]]]\nln addition to the master criminal [[Adam Worth]], there has been much speculation<ref>Schaefer, B.

It is averred that surviving [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priests at the [[preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]] [[Stonyhurst Saint Mary's Hall|Hodder Place]], [[Stonyhurst]], instantly recognized the physical description of Moriarty as that of the Rev.

Moriarty is aware of the deception and refers to \"Holmes\" as \"that imbecile\", as opposed to Watson, whom he grudgingly respects.

In the feature-length episode ''[[Sherlock Holmes (1984 TV series)|The Eligible Bachelor]]'' (an adaptation of \"[[The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor]]\"), Holmes describes Moriarty as \"a giant of evil\" and says, \"Moriarty combined science with evil.

The body of the original Moriarty was still covered in ice behind the waterfall he fell from during his battle with Holmes. \n* [[John Huston]] portrayed Moriarty in the [[made-for-TV movie]] ''[[Sherlock Holmes in New York]]'' opposite [[Roger Moore]]'s Holmes, attempting to rob the Bank of New York while threatening Irene Adler's son to prevent Holmes from investigating, although Holmes and Watson are able to rescue the son and solve the crime, regardless. \n* In the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] series of television films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson]]'' by [[Igor Maslennikov]], Moriarty was played by Viktor Yevgrafov and voiced by [[Oleg Dahl]] in the second film of the series. \n* In the Russian-produced ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2013 TV series)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' series by [[Andrey Kavun]], Moriarty was played by actor [[Alexey Gorbunov]].\n* A [[holodeck]] simulation of Professor Moriarty, played by actor [[Daniel Davis]], appeared in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episodes \"[[Elementary, Dear Data (TNG episode)|Elementary, Dear Data]]\" and \"[[Ship in a Bottle (TNG episode)|Ship in a Bottle]]\", accidentally achieving an artificial sentience when [[Geordi LaForge]] asks the holodeck to create an opponent able to defeat [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] (rather than Sherlock Holmes). {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n* Moriarty appears as a holographic character in the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode \"[[Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch]]\", where he comes out of the Holoshed of the [[Nimbus (Futurama)|Nimbus]] with [[Attila the Hun]], [[Jack The Ripper]], and [[Abraham Lincoln|Evil (Abraham) Lincoln]]. \n* In ''[[The Strange Case of the End of Civilization as We Know It]]'', [[Connie Booth]] plays Moriarty's granddaughter, Francine, who is disguised as the modern-day [[Mrs. Hudson]]. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}.\n* \"Elementary My Dear Winston\", the third episode for the 1989 season of ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'', features Holmes, Watson and Moriarty by way of \"belief made manifest\": so many people believed in them that they became real.

In the Series 2 finale \"[[The Reichenbach Fall]]\", he frames Holmes as a fake and threatens his friends to drive him to suicide. He seemingly shoots himself to make sure Sherlock commits suicide in case Sherlock deduces the code necessary to call off Moriarty's assassins. However, at the end of \"[[His Last Vow]]\", his face appears on TV screens across the country as a mostly static image, only the mouth moving, similar to that of a ventriloquist's dummy. Although Sherlock spends most of the subsequent special (\"[[The Abominable Bride]]\") in an elaborate hallucination of a similar case in the 1890s to try and determine how Jim might have survived- briefly considering an elaborate switch involving a terminal patient dying on Jim's behalf- he eventually concludes that Jim is genuinely dead, although he also notes that he is now aware of what his foe plans to do next.\n* Moriarty appeared in two episodes of the [[animated series]] ''[[BraveStarr]]'', voiced by [[Jonathan Harris]].\n* In the US television series ''[[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]]'', Moriarty is equated with [[Irene Adler]] (played by [[Natalie Dormer]]). As with Moriarty, she is first mentioned in the twelfth episode of the first season ([[List of Elementary episodes#Episodes|\"M\"]]). Holmes tracks an apparent serial killer who uses the name \"M\"; upon his capture, he is discovered to be [[Sebastian Moran]], Moriarty's henchman, whose seemingly random murders were actually assassinations carried out for his employer, whom he claims to have never met. In the season finale, \"Irene Adler\" is revealed to be an alias created by Moriarty in order to get close to Holmes and observe him (a male voice who spoke to Holmes as \"Moriarty\" over the telephone is revealed to be a hired actor).

Moriarty is to do Prospero's bidding, but finds himself wanting to help the Librarians every now and then, instead. He ultimately sacrifices himself to save them, and is returned to the book.\n\n===Theatre===\n* In the [[William Gillette]] play, Moriarty was played on Broadway in the original  (1899\u20131900) run by George Wessells (and again in 1905), then by [[Frank Keenan]] (1928), John Miltern (1929\u201330) and [[Philip Locke]], [[Clive Revill]] and [[Alan Sues]] from 1974\u201376.\n* In the play ''Sherlock Holmes'' by [[Ouida Rathbone]] (wife of actor [[Basil Rathbone]]), which ran at the [[New Century Theatre]] in New York City for only three performances from 30\u201331 October 1953, Moriarty was played by [[Thomas Gomez]]. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n* [[Jeremy Brett]] and [[Edward Hardwicke]] played Holmes and Watson in the [[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (TV series)|''Sherlock Holmes'' TV series]] made by [[Granada Television]]. [[Eric Porter]] played the professor. In the late 1980s, Brett and Hardwicke appeared in the stage play ''The Secret of Sherlock Holmes'' by Jeremy Paul, a regular contributor to the series. The only characters in the play are Holmes and Watson and it highlights many aspects of their relationship from their first meeting to the [[Reichenbach Falls]]. In the second half it is indicated that Moriarty never existed: he was a figment of the imagination of Holmes who needed a worthy enemy as much as he needed a devoted friend like Watson. In ''[[The Final Problem]]'', Watson and Moriarty never actually meet in person.<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/kli.freeshell.org\/HolmesEG\/secret.html|title=The Secret of Sherlock Holmes Play|publisher=Kli.freeshell.org|accessdate=30 January 2011}}<\/ref>\n\n===Literature===\n* [[T. S. Eliot]], a fan of Sherlock Holmes fiction, used the phrase \"the Napoleon of crime\" in homage to describe [[Macavity (character)|Macavity]] in ''[[Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats]]''. There are further likenesses between the two as T.S. Eliot talks of Macavity's virtues in stealth, his tall and thin stature with sunken eyes and a domed forehead. All of these descriptions are matched precisely to the Moriarty of Conan Doyle. \n* In [[Neil Gaiman]]'s [[Hugo Award]] winning short-story ''[[A Study in Emerald]]'', the Moriarty and Holmes of an [[alternate history]] reverse roles. Moriarty (who, although never named as such in the story, is identified as the author of ''Dynamics of an Asteroid'') is hired to investigate a murder. The murder has apparently been carried out by Sherlock Holmes (who signs his name Rache, an allusion to Doyle's first novella starring Holmes and Watson, ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'', in which \"Rache\" \u2014 German for \"revenge\" \u2014 is found written above the body of a murder victim), and Dr Watson. The story is narrated by [[Colonel Sebastian Moran]], given the rank of Major (Ret.) by Gaiman. \n* In ''Detective Comics'' 572, the fiftieth anniversary of Batman's first appearance, Batman and several other DC characters met descendants of Moriarty and Dr Watson. Prof. Moriarty appeared in a flashback sequence; a 135-year-old Holmes had a brief cameo at the end of the story. \n* In a 2006 comic book story featuring [[Lee Falk]]'s ''[[The Phantom]]'', the 19th Phantom has to fight Prof. Moriarty; the climax of the story features the Phantom and Moriarty falling down a waterfall in the Bangalla jungle. At the end of the story, Moriarty is shown to be alive, as he returns to London to find \"a detective named [[Sherlock Holmes]]\". \n* [[Dorothy Sayers]]'s story ''The Adventurous Exploit of the Cave of Ali Baba'' is consciously modeled upon \"[[The Final Problem]]\" and \"[[The Adventure of the Empty House|The Empty House]]\". Lord [[Peter Wimsey]] is apparently killed, only to return from the dead at the end of the story and reveal he had faked his death in order to trap a very dangerous super-criminal. The debt to the original Doyle story is explicitly acknowledged in Sayers' story, in a passage in which Wimsey refers to the criminal he is tracking as \"''The Moriarty of this gang''\". \n* In [[Nicholas Meyer]]'s 1976 novel, ''[[The Seven-Per-Cent Solution]]'', Prof. Moriarty is portrayed as Holmes' childhood [[mathematics]] tutor, a whining little man with a guilty secret. He is incensed to hear that Holmes, apparently under the influence of [[cocaine]], has depicted him as a criminal mastermind. Due to Holmes' worsening condition, Moriarty threatens to tell the authorities about Holmes' addiction. Dr. Watson seeks the help of [[Sigmund Freud]], who uncovers the truth behind Holmes' perception of \"the Napoleon of Crime\". This is one of many works to seize on the fact that Moriarty never actually shows his face in the Holmes canon. The novel, ''[[The Seven-Per-Cent Solution]]'', was made into a 1976 film and starred [[Laurence Olivier]] as a very different sort of Professor Moriarty. \n* In the 1979 novel, ''[http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Enter-Lion-Posthumous-Memoir-Mycroft\/dp\/0801552869\/ref=la_B00288CNY8_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1382656502&sr=1-1 Enter the Lion: A Posthumous Memoir of Mycroft Holmes]'', written by Michael P. Hodel and Sean M. Wright, Jerrold Moriarty, the father of the Moriarty brothers, is [[Mycroft Holmes]]' immediate superior in the Foreign Office and plays an important part in a plot by former Confederate officers to involve the British government in a scheme to overthrow the United States government. His exposure by Mycroft and Sherlock leads to his suicide to avoid arrest, for which Professor Moriarty blames the Holmes brothers, and provides an explanation as to the antagonism between Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty. The Professor himself makes two appearances in the novel. \n* [[Michael Kurland]] wrote a series of novels in which Moriarty is the hero: his crime organisation is the method whereby he raises funds for his experimental physics apparatus. In the first book of the series, ''The Infernal Device'', he foils a plot against Queen Victoria, reluctantly allying with Holmes. \n* [[John Gardner (British writer)|John Gardner]] has written three novels featuring the arch-villain: ''The Return of Moriarty'', in which the Professor, like Holmes, is shown to have survived the meeting at the Reichenbach, ''The Revenge of Moriarty'' and ''Moriarty'' (released posthumously in 2008 after the author's death in 2007). In these novels, Moriarty is depicted as a Victorian-era [[Al Capone]] or [[Vito Corleone|Don Corleone]], who single-handedly controls London's [[organized crime]] structure. \"The Professor\" is not really Moriarty, but Moriarty's younger brother, also named James, and as brilliant as his older brother, whom he impersonates, disgraces, and murders, later stealing the decedent's identity. \n* Moriarty appears in [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]''. Recruited from university by British Intelligence, he supposedly set up his criminal empire as part of an undercover operation to monitor crime in London which got out of hand, to the point where the 'cover' became more real to Moriarty than his role in British Intelligence. Having survived the encounter with Holmes, he went on to become head of British Intelligence under the code-name \"[[M (James Bond)|M]]\" but still maintained his criminal interests. He instigated the creation of the League as a [[covert operation|covert ops]] unit with [[plausible deniability]] and used them to recover an anti-gravity mineral called [[The First Men in the Moon|Cavorite]] which had been stolen by his crime lord rival [[Fu Manchu|The Doctor]]. He used the Cavorite to bomb the [[East End of London]] in an attempt to destroy The Doctor but was thwarted by the League which had uncovered the double-cross. Following his supposed death (indicated, but not clearly portrayed, as he \"falls\" into the sky while clutching the Cavorite), he was ironically succeeded as \"M\" by [[Mycroft Holmes]], Sherlock's older brother. In ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier]]'', it is suggested that [[Jack Kerouac]]'s Dean Moriarty (from ''[[On the Road]]'') is his great-grandson, and the rivalry between the two criminals is continued by the fact that The Doctor's great-grandson is Kerouac's other creation, [[Doctor Sax]]. In the third volume, set more than six decades later, Mina Murray comes across his carcass, still holding onto the cavorite inside a block of ice floating through space. \n* [[Kim Newman]]'s novel ''[[Anno Dracula]]'' depicts Moriarty as the spokesman of a league of villains drawn from popular fiction. In this Moriarty is a vampire and is no longer interested in criminal pursuits as he now has an eternal life which he can dedicate to intellectual contemplation. Newman has written a series of short stories about Moriarty, narrated Watson-style by Colonel Moran, in which Moriarty interacts with many of his fictional contemporaries. They have been collected in ''Professor Moriarty: The Hound of the D'Urbervilles''. One of the stories, \"The Red Planet League\", first appeared in ''[[Gaslight Grimoire]]''. Another story, \"The Adventure of the Greek Invertebrate\" (a play on \"[[The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter]]\", which introduced Sherlock Holmes' brother Mycroft), features Professor Moriarty's two brothers, also named James, the colonel and the station master, and offers an explanation for the lack of variety in their forenames. The last story, \"The Problem of the Final Adventure\", retells ''[[The Adventure of the Final Problem]]'' from the other side, revealing there was more going on than Watson (and perhaps Holmes) realised. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n* ''[[The Titanic Tragedy]]'' by [[William Seil]] features Holmes and Watson on the maiden voyage of the [[R.M.S. Titanic|''Titanic'']] as part of a mission to deliver secret submarine plans to America for Mycroft, during which they encounter Professor Moriarty's brother, Colonel Moriarty, as a fellow passenger on the ship (Holmes noting that the fact that both brothers were named James shows a lack of imagination on the part of their parents, expressing his surprise at Moriarty's own intellectual gifts from such a background). Although the colonel initially appears to forgive Holmes for his brother's death (Albeit in absentia, as he expresses this sentiment to Watson while unaware that Holmes is on board in disguise), it is subsequently revealed that he is actually attempting to acquire the plans for himself to sell on to the highest bidder. At the conclusion of the novel, the colonel attempts to lure Holmes to him for a final confrontation as the ''Titanic'' sinks, but as with his brother, he ends up falling to his death, while Holmes survives the sinking with the air of a lifejacket and a forgotten collapsible lifeboat.\n* Commenting on [[Nero Wolfe]]'s prolonged struggle with powerful crime boss [[Nero Wolfe supporting characters#Arnold Zeck|Arnold Zeck]], [[Michael Dirda]] \u2014 book critic for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' \u2014 wrote \"I was thrilled when Wolfe finally encountered his own Moriarty in the archvillain Arnold Zeck\".<ref>[[Michael Dirda|Dirda, Michael]].

His younger brother, Col. James Moriarty, appears as the antagonist of another short story in Thomas' ''The Execution of Sherlock Holmes''.\n* In ''[[The Mandala of Sherlock Holmes]]'', set during Holmes' three-year fake \"death\", Holmes encounters Moriarty during his trip in [[Tibet]], where he learns that Moriarty is actually \"the Dark One\", a former Tibetan mystic possessing great psychic powers who lost his memories in an attack on the [[Dalai Lama]], only for his near-death experience on the Reichenbach Falls to restore his memory, albeit leaving him horribly crippled and disfigured by his injuries. He attempts to acquire a legendary crystal that would allow him to wield even greater power, but, although Moriarty acquires the crystal, boosting his powers and healing his injuries, he is defeated when it is revealed that Holmes is partly possessed by the spirit of the Dark One's old rival, allowing Holmes to wield similar powers to Moriarty's and delay him long enough for Holmes' ally, Huree Chunder Mockerjee, to knock the crystal away from Moriarty and into Holmes' hands, allowing Holmes to turn Moriarty's powers against him, vaporising his body and destroying him once and for all. \n* In ''[[The Beekeeper's Apprentice]]'' by [[Laurie R. King]], an elderly Holmes and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, Mary Russell, are pursued by Moriarty's middle-aged daughter, also an Oxford mathematics don, and a criminal kingpin in her own right, who threatens Holmes' remaining friends as she attempts to force Holmes to kill himself after signing a fake confession 'admitting' he framed her father as a criminal out of jealousy and that most of his cases were solved by others. The detective provokes her by noting that her father essentially committed suicide by confronting Holmes in such an isolated spot without any weapon, which results in her accidentally shooting herself <!-- fatally? -->while struggling with Mary Russell. \n* In the [[Italian comics|Italian comic book]] ''[[Martin Myst\u00e8re]]'' Moriarty wasn't killed at [[Reichenbach Falls]]. Both he and Holmes survived and continued with their previous works. At the beginning of [[World War I]], Moriarty stole a formula for [[Chemical warfare|poison gas]] from the British government. When he attempted to sell the formula to the [[Central Powers]], he was discovered by Holmes, who killed Moriarty, but only after Moriarty managed to fatally wound [[Doctor Watson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www-en.sergiobonellieditore.it\/auto\/scheda_speciale?collana=13&numero=130&subnum=|title=Martin Myst\u00e8re: The impossible world of Sherlock Holmes|publisher=En.sergiobonellieditore.it|accessdate=30 January 2011}}<\/ref>\n* In [[Anthony Horowitz]]' 2011 novel, ''[[The House of Silk]]'', the first \"official\" (authorized by Doyle's estate) Holmes story since Doyle's death, a chapter is dedicated to Watson's meeting with a secretive criminal mastermind. This character is not definitively identified, however it is heavily implied that he is James Moriarty. Watson later states that he believes this to be the case, and in an appendix Horowitz states the identity of the character outright. Moriarty also appears as a corpse in the sequel to this novel, in which Pinkerton detective Frederick Chase is investigating the events that took place at the Reichenbach Falls. However it turns out at the end of the book that the corpse in fact belonged to a man murdered by Moriarty and that Frederick Chase is himself Moriarty in disguise.\n* In various books in [[David Weber]]'s \"[[Honorverse]]\" series, the name Moriarty has been applied to a defensive weapon system developed by the Republic of Haven. The system is deployed as a missile fire control system, for system defense against naval assaults. The concept, while easily countered by \"Mistletoe\" missiles (a variation of the \"skipper\" missiles seen in the movie ''[[Wing Commander (film)|Wing Commander]]''), is nonetheless the inspiration for the Manticoran development of the \"Mycroft\" defensive weapon system in ''[[A Rising Thunder]]''. \n* In ''[[Artemis Fowl (novel)|Artemis Fowl]]'', the first book in the young adult [[Artemis Fowl (series)|Artemis Fowl series]] by [[Eoin Colfer]], LEPrecon officer Jullius Root remarks about the criminal mastermind Fowl's criminal activities and his abduction of officer Holly Short: ''\"Too much damned TV. Thinks he's Sherlock Holmes\"''. Foaly corrects him, saying ''\"...That's professor Moriarty ... Holmes, Moriarty, they both look the same with the flesh scorched off their skulls.'\" \n* In [[Paco Ignacio Taibo II]]'s \"The Return of the Tigers of Malaysia\", Dr James Moriarty appears as the mastermind behind the attacks on [[Sandokan]] and his friend Yanez.\n* In [[Emma Jane Holloway]]'s ''Baskerville Affair'' trilogy of [[steampunk]] novels, the young James Moriarty is a junior professor of mathematics at Cambridge University who moonlights as a henchman for one of the steam barons, but has his own criminal agenda.\n*Peter Grant, protagonist of [[Ben Aaronovitch]]'s ''[[Rivers of London (novel)|Rivers of London]]'' series, on several occasions wonders whether his own arch-enemy - the evil magician known as \"The Faceless Man\" - is equal to Moriarty in criminal cunning. After being the target of an especially audacious coup, which leaves Grant deeply hurt emotionally as well as physically, Grant concludes that The Faceless Man does indeed fully qualify as \"a Moriarty\".\n* In Edward Wellen's \"The House that Jack Built\" it is revealed that in his desperate need to have a foe worthy of himself Holmes has developed [[Dissociative identity disorder]] with Moriarty the other personality.\n\n===Video games===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}\n* In ''The Lost Cases of Sherlock Holmes'', Moriarty is unmasked as the villain in the 16th and last mystery, but while his scheme is foiled, the Professor escapes when Holmes must focus on disarming a bomb inside the [[Big Ben]] clock tower.\n* In the computer adventure ''[[Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened]]'', Holmes encounters Moriarty locked in a [[Switzerland]] mental hospital in 1895 (four years after \"[[The Final Problem]]\"), where the Professor has suffered severe brain injuries from the Falls. Not recognizing Holmes in disguise, Moriarty is tricked into thinking his nemesis is in the hospital lobby, and charges from his cell in a frenzy, giving Holmes a diversion so he may investigate the asylum's secrets further. By the opening of the sequel, ''[[Sherlock Holmes versus Ars\u00e8ne Lupin]]'', or ''Sherlock Holmes: Nemesis'', there has been no word of any mental recovery or escape attempts by Moriarty. Holmes remarks to Watson, \"If there had, we would be on the way to Switzerland already.\" \n* In ''[[The Testament of Sherlock Holmes]]'', Moriarty is the main antagonist who tries to frame Holmes and create anarchy.\n* In ''[[Wizard101]]'', the character Meowiarty is based on Prof. Moriarty.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/files\/834\/834-h\/834-h.htm#link2H_4_0011 The Final Problem]\n* [http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/files\/3776\/3776-h\/3776-h.htm The Valley of Fear]\n* [http:\/\/sherlock.mindcop.net Sherlock Holmes Public Library]\n* {{IMDb character|0027269}}\n\n{{HolmesNovels}}\n\n[[Category:America's Best Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1893]]\n[[Category:Fictional English people]]\n[[Category:Fictional gentleman thieves]]\n[[Category:Fictional intellectuals]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Fictional professors]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\n[[Category:Thriller film characters]]\n[[Category:Literary villains]]\n[[Category:Sherlock Holmes characters]]","timestamp":"20160410105509","user-timestamp":"20150410105509"},{"title":"User talk:92.9.151.242","content":"==Your recent edits==\n\nHi there.

I was interested to find out what Gary was working on and the many groups he had played with. Gary really didn't divulge his musical portfolio, He never really divulged a great deal about his hidden talents, You would think that most musician baring such high reputation would be blinding me with artist and albums, but this was not the man I had just spoken to.\n\nGary was some what quite modest with is achievements although he is in fact quite a legend in his own right. I found Gary extremely pleasant to talk to, he did not appear to be anything other than a genuine light hearted musician with a good sense of humour, this is quite refreshing when a few reasonable good musician are up there own ass.\n\nI eventually heard play a really good number on his Tenor Sax with 7 String Les; it was Gorger on my mind, it seemed that he really was a bit tasty on the sax. That evening at home I decided too find out a little bit about the man they call Gary Barnacle. Sitting at my PC I typed his name into my Google search engine and searched his name. I was Gob smacked, he was everywhere, and every page was about him in fact there was not one page that didn't make a reference to him. I was absolutely blown away, it turns out that Humble Gary Barnacle was keeping some finer points about his career secret.\n\nI crashed a bluesmothers gig thinking it was a Jam, all one its own. Feeling a little after thinking it was a jam I sat out to hear Gary play, he demonstrated just how talented he really is. The pleasure was all mine when asked to Join in a few numbers, my nerves were jittery and the butterflies did really help maters, thanks to the internet and finding out tonns that he is extreamly talented. Les eased me in gently and gary helped carry me a great deal through the first couple of numbers, easing the nerves to a point that i started to feel the sax sing. The night turned out to be a very rememberable one at that and in the one hell of a music lesson, no money could buy.Gary a wealth of knowledge and years of experiance which he is very forthwith and share, i for one have listened to him intently and today used some of these very techniques when playing, Some of the techniques are incredibly difficult to master which just only goes to show just how good garys control on the saxophone really is. Gary stands out as a true professional in his own right when he plays his horn and along with the many other top saxophonists is really in a league which is second to non. I feel rather privelage to have met Gary and always enjoy his company, his notoriety is not my real of interest, although his contribution to the music industry is huge. The hunger to improve to the highest standard within my pertential and gain as much experiance from truly gifted musicians is my inspiration . Les was right to say Gary was awsome. He really is a very talented guy with a impressive carrier, truly awesome to watch but out of this world to listern to. I will always value the Jams that gary attends and continue to use his wisdom to pursue the passion and craving which drives me to be inspired to play my sax. Gary's talent just speak volumes, if you ever get the chance to see him perform trust me when I say you won't be disappointed.

The spinner would land on either a question or a \"dare\". Each action (or question) is worth a certain amount of points. If a player does not perform the action or answer a question they must wear a \"zit sticker\" for the rest of the game.

In their free time they created ''[[WarWizard]]'', a [[shareware]] [[role-playing video game]] that they released in 1993.  McQuaid and Clover then developed a ''WarWizard 2'' [[game demo|demo]] in 1995, which caught the attention of [[John Smedley (video games)|John Smedley]] of [[Sony Interactive Studios America]].  Smedley hired McQuaid and Clover in 1996 to work on an online role-playing game, later named ''[[EverQuest]]''.\n\nMcQuaid started as the project's [[lead programmer]] but was made the [[game producer|producer]] and one of the [[game designer|lead designers]].  While ''EverQuest'' was being developed, [[Origin Systems]] launched ''[[Ultima Online]]'' in 1997 which became the top MMORPG.  ''EverQuest'' became a huge hit and within months of its March 1999 launch it topped the subscription numbers held by ''Ultima Online''.  ''[[PC Gamer]]'' called McQuaid one of the \"Next Game Gods\" in its November 2000 issue, believing that he would eventually become one of the industry's most influential game developers.<ref>''[[PC Gamer (US)|PC Gamer]]''. November 2000. \"Meet the Next Game Gods\".<\/ref> After [[Sony Online Entertainment]] acquired Verant Interactive, Brad McQuaid was promoted to [[Vice President]] of Premium Games and [[Chief Creative Officer]].\n\n===Vanguard: Saga of Heroes===\nHe left Sony to create [[Sigil Games]] with fellow game designer and EverQuest development team member Jeff Butler in January 2002. Several years later, McQuaid announced that Sigil would release a new ''next generation'' MMORPG. This game was given the name ''[[Vanguard: Saga of Heroes]]''. The game was finally released to the public in January 2007, five years after Sigil was founded. However, ''Vanguard'' had many technical problems, lacked nearly every feature that Brad had promised, and it was unanimously regarded as a failure upon launch.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Brad McQuaid admitted that the game was not ready in January but was released early due to \"financial resources\".[http:\/\/www.fohguild.org\/forums\/mmorpg-general-discussion\/27757-nino-one-upsides-vg-66.html#post699867 Full quote]\n\nAfter five months of disappointing reviews and sales, on May 15, 2007, Sony Online Entertainment officially announced that it had purchased the key assets of Sigil Games Online. Brad McQuaid resigned from his position of leadership within Sigil and was given a very limited role of \"creative consultant\".\n\n===Current===\nAfter the much criticized launch of ''Vanguard: Saga of Heroes'', McQuaid disappeared from the public view, and his personal website went off-line. Rumours circulated amongst gamers on the Internet as to why the game turned out so poorly and what was going on behind the scenes at Sigil Games.  In June 2009, Brad updated his personal website, initially only very briefly commenting on ''Vanguard'', but also stating that, \"in the last few months I\u2019ve really felt that desire to be back in the industry and creating games.\"\n\nAfter some casual posts in his blog (on his personal website), he then started a series of posts which he had entitled a \"Vanguard: Post-mortem\". His intention was to set the record straight on what went wrong with ''Vanguard''.  To summarise, his \"Part One\" focused on Sigil's relationship with Microsoft. Part Two discussed the difficulties of working with the all-star staff Sigil hired for ''Vanguard''. Part Three focused on technical issues. On June 16, 2010, McQuaid updated his Blog to announce that he was the co-founder of a new gaming company in San Diego, CA. Some months later, the blog was removed from the website, leaving the website as just a single page website.\n\nOn July 6, 2012, Sony Online Entertainment announced the re-hiring of McQuaid to continue work on ''Vanguard'' including its ''Free-to-Play'' transition. http:\/\/vgplayers.station.sony.com\/newsArchive.vm?section=News&month=current&id=1425\n\nOn March 6, 2013, McQuaid announced that he had returned to working on EverQuest.<ref>{{cite web|last=McQuaid|first=Brad|title=12 years?

This news, coupled with a string of hints dropped throughout Twitter and various message board posts, led the community to believe that McQuaid intended to work on a true spiritual successor to EverQuest and Vanguard independently.\n\nOn January 13, 2014 the game was announced as ''[[Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen]]'' alongside a [[Kickstarter]] campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.pcgamer.com\/2014\/01\/13\/pantheon-rise-of-the-fallen-preview\/|title=Brad McQuaid talks Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen, Kickstarter campaign launches today|last=Johnson|first=Leif|date=13 January 2014|work=[[PC Gamer UK]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|accessdate=13 January 2014}}<\/ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [http:\/\/www.thegrouchygamer.com\/?p=39 Brad McQuaid Abandoned Vanguard, Sigil]\n* [http:\/\/www.virginworlds.com\/pg.php?n=7026 Brad McQuaid and Hutzpa]\n* [http:\/\/www.silkyvenom.com\/pages\/faq.php?faqid=791&expand=794#faq794 Will SOE influence Vanguard's gameplay?]\n\n==External links==\n* [http:\/\/www.bradmcquaid.com\/ Brad McQuaid's Website]\n* [http:\/\/www.vanguardSOH.com\/ ''Vanguard: Saga of Heroes'']\n* [http:\/\/www.f13.net\/index.php?itemid=562 \"The Hub of All Blame: A Postmortem\"].

From the earliest stages of his career, Zeng Fanzhi's paintings have been marked by their emotional directness, the artist's intuitive psychological sense, and his carefully calibrated expressionistic technique. Moving to Beijing in the early 1990s, Zeng's art displayed an immediate shift, responding to his immersion in a more superficial environment, his seminal Mask series displaying the tensions between the artist's dominant existential concerns and an ironic treatment of the pomposity and posturing inherent to his new contemporary urban life. Throughout, Zeng's expressionistic techniques run counter to such techniques' conventional usage. That is, Zeng's representation of raw, exposed flesh or awkwardly over-sized hands is not an attempt at pure emotional expression, but instead play against the superficially composed appearances of his subjects, an ironic treatment of emotional performance as a metaphor for a lost self, of stunted self-realization.\n\n==Early life==\nZeng Fanzhi was born in 1964 in [[Wuhan]], [[Hubei]] province and lives and works in [[Beijing]].<ref name=acq>{{cite web|title=Zeng Fanzhi|url=http:\/\/www.acquavellagalleries.com\/exhibitions\/2009-04-02_zeng-fanzhi\/|publisher=Acquavella Galleries|accessdate=25 April 2012}}<\/ref> He grew up during the [[Cultural Revolution]], after which he attended [[Hubei Academy of Fine Arts]].<ref name=acq \/> There, he was largely influenced by Expressionism. Zeng is one of the most popular artists of his era,<ref name=acq \/> in addition to being one of Asia's most financially successful artists.<ref name=vanityfair>{{cite web|title=The Thinker|url=http:\/\/fabienfryns.blogspot.de\/2010_07_01_archive.html|publisher=Vanity Fair|accessdate=3 May 2012}}<\/ref> In May, 2008, he set a world auction record when one of his contemporary Chinese art pieces \u201cMask Series 1996 No. 6\u201d was sold for $9.6 million in Hong Kong.<ref name=acq \/> Zeng has lived and worked in Beijing since 1993, and has been exhibited all over the globe in venues such as the [[Shanghai Art Museum]], [[National Art Museum of China]], Kunst Museum Bonn, Kunstmuseum Bern, Santa Monica Art Centre, Art Centre,<ref name=acq \/> and Le Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Art moderne de la Ville de Paris.<ref>[http:\/\/www.mam.paris.fr\/fr\/expositions\/zeng-fanzhi Official Show Website]<\/ref>\n\n==Art School==\nZeng was in art school from 1987-1991, and he paid a particular interest in German Expressionist painters.<ref name=li>{{cite web|last=Li|first=Xianting|title=Zeng Fanzhi|url=http:\/\/www.shanghartgallery.com\/galleryarchive\/texts\/id\/157|publisher=ShanghART Gallery|accessdate=25 April 2012}}<\/ref> During his third year of schooling, he began instead to learn more about the actual approaches that the expressionists would take to painting.<ref name=li \/> By the time his first show came to fruition, it was apparent that he had gained his very own style and the work gained him a large amount of respect in the Chinese art scene.<ref name=li \/>\n\n==Artistic Progression==\nFrom the start, Zeng has been heavily influenced by his physical and emotional circumstances. Zeng's first mature series was his \"Hospital Series\", inspired by the scenes he witnessed in the local clinic near where he lived. At the same time, as an art student, Zeng studied German Expressionism, and the preponderance of social upheaval and intensely felt emotion, against a backdrop of social upheaval, had resonance in his own life. In his ''Hospital'' series, Zeng moved to a theme that included the use of hospital interiors, where he devoted much of the detail to the patients\u2019 moods and the power that certain brush stroking techniques could yield.<ref name=li \/> These paintings often hinted at a sadomasochistic relationship in the world with his pale colors and blood colored flesh of the patients.<ref name=li \/> In using these techniques, he shows a somewhat pessimistic view of the world.<ref name=li \/> His expressionist technique shined through in these works further with an extreme expression in the eyes of the characters.<ref name=li \/> Also, the hands of the patients are notably oversized and the joints are much larger as well.<ref name=li \/> The scenes he depicts seem to show patients caught up in seeming hysteria, and the deep red colors show anger of sorts.<ref name=li \/>\n\nAfter 1994, Zeng\u2019s work shifted toward his ''Mask'' series in which his style takes a drastic shift that is considered the second period in his work.<ref name=li \/> Instead of the anger and brutal nature of the hospital series, the Mask series is more apathetic.<ref name=li \/> The scenes are painted from a distance, and have a mask of some sort as the center of focus.<ref name=li \/> The groups are often small or include a single person, and that seems to show that Zeng is touching on personal relationships and the fact that society is filled with false relationships.<ref name=li \/> By using a mask, even if a person is with a group, there is a sense of solitude for the person wearing the mask.<ref name=li \/> He also explores new techniques that include using a palette knife as a paintbrush.<ref name=li \/> This causes the characters to have an even more blurred edge to them, which essentially masks the painting as a whole.<ref name=li \/> The lighting on the paintings are not coming from an obvious source, and the characters seem to be separated from the world around them through an awkward placement in the background.<ref name=li \/> Through the different techniques, the characters seem much more calm than his earlier hospital series.<ref name=li \/> The figures\u2019 hands are in fists and also much more realistic and apparent than in the past, and this causes them to seem as though they are controlling an emotion instead of venting anger, etc.<ref name=li \/>\n\nThe art by Zeng after 1997 becomes much more stylish through the incorporation of new types of backgrounds like the sea.<ref name=li \/> He uses softer colors that are more blended into each other and this makes for a more comfortable viewing experience.<ref name=li \/> Rather than anger or a controlled emotion, these figures are more relaxed and their hands are sometimes in their pockets.<ref name=li \/> This seems to show that the artist\u2019s mood at the time is also more relaxed and has an understanding of life.<ref name=li \/> What was once angry and bold has become more calm through different brush strokes, but there is still a sort of anxiety that can be noted by the fact that the characters have larger-than-normal heads.<ref name=li \/> Rather than his expressionist beginnings, his work now seems to consist largely of symbolism.<ref name=li \/>\n\n==''We n:2''==\n''We n:2'' is both an abstract and a self-portrait of Zeng Fanzhi.<ref name=we>{{cite web|last=Zeng|first=Fanzhi|title=We n:2|url=http:\/\/www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk\/artists\/artpages\/zeng_fanzhi_we.htm|publisher=The Saatchi Gallery|accessdate=25 April 2012}}<\/ref> The fact that the face is so large and dominating causes the viewer to feel almost minuscule in its presence.<ref name=we \/> He uses squiggle lines that create a screen that describes the impossibility of truly knowing someone.<ref name=we \/> The marks that he makes over his face almost cause a \u201cghost image, echoing multiplicity and technological distortion.\u201d <ref name=we \/>\n\n==''This Land Is So Rich In Beauty 2''==\nConsidering the expressionist style of Zeng\u2019s work, the viewer seems to feel violent tension.<ref name=this>{{cite web|last=Zeng|first=Fanzhi|title=This Land Is So Rich In Beauty 2|url=http:\/\/www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk\/artists\/artpages\/zeng_fanzhi_untitled.htm|publisher=The Saatchi Gallery|accessdate=25 April 2012}}<\/ref> His landscapes are some of his best work, and while painting them he uses two separate brushes.<ref name=this \/> In doing so, one brush demonstrates the purpose of what he is painting, and the other is \u201cleaving traces of his subconscious through processes.\u201d<ref name=this \/> This causes his landscapes to not only have a real feel to them, but also an abstract sense of expression.<ref name=this \/>\n\n==''Tiananmen''==\nIn an effort to describe the rocky past, Zeng places an abstract version of Chairman Mao over the building in Tiananmen Square.<ref name=tia>{{cite web|last=Zeng|first=Fanzhi|title=Tiananmen|url=http:\/\/www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk\/artists\/artpages\/zeng_fanzhi_tiananmen.htm|publisher=The Saatchi Gallery|accessdate=25 April 2012}}<\/ref> The bright reds and oranges show both an ironic sense of great courage over the top of an uncertain future.<ref name=tia \/> The painting is given animation with a flurry of brush strokes that replace what would normally be depicted as stoic and straight-laced.<ref name=tia \/> The fact that Chairman Mao\u2019s portrait dominates the painting is possibly a symbol for his dominance over Chinese culture.<ref name=tia \/>\n\n==Art market==\nIn May 2008, [[Christie's]] Hong Kong pioneered the Asian Contemporary Art Evening sale. Zeng Fanzhi's Mask Series No.6 was sold for HK$75,367,500.

Neely was an assistant football coach at [[University of Alabama|Alabama]] under former Vanderbilt assistant [[Wallace Wade]] from 1928 to 1930, and compiled a 28\u201315\u20132 record as the school's head baseball coach from 1929 to 1930. From 1931 to 1939 he coached at Clemson, compiling a 43\u201335\u20137 record. Neely coached at Rice from 1940 to 1966 with a 144\u2013124\u201310 record, the most wins by a Rice coach.\n\nHe won the first four bowl games he coached: the 1940 Cotton Bowl (with Clemson), the 1946 Orange Bowl and the 1949 and 1953 Cotton Bowls (with Rice). At Rice, Neely lost the last three bowl games he coached: the 1957 Cotton Bowl, the 1960 Sugar Bowl and 1961 [[Bluebonnet Bowl]]. Arguably the biggest was the 1940 Cotton Bowl upset of [[Frank Leahy]]'s [[1940 Boston College Eagles football team|Boston College Eagles]]. Neely was 1949 [[Southwest Conference]] coach of the year.\n\nAfter the 1966 season he returned to Vanderbilt as athletic director, and received the [[Amos Alonzo Stagg Award]] the following year.

The total length of the river is {{convert|3,180|km|mi|abbr=on}} which makes it one of longest [[List of rivers of Asia|rivers in Asia]]. It flows\nthrough western [[Tibet]], the Indian state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] and [[Pakistan]]. Originating in the [[Tibetan Plateau]] in the vicinity of [[Lake Mansarovar]], the river runs a course through the [[Ladakh]] region of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], towards [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] and then flows in a southerly direction along the entire length of [[Punjab, Pakistan]] to merge into the [[Arabian Sea]] near the port city of [[Karachi]] in [[Sindh]]. It is the [[List of rivers in Pakistan|longest river]] of Pakistan.\n\nThe river has a total [[drainage area]] exceeding {{convert|1,165,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Its estimated annual flow stands at around {{convert|207|km3|abbr=on}}, making it the twenty-first largest river in the world in terms of annual flow. The [[Zanskar River|Zanskar]] is its left bank tributary in [[Ladakh]]. In the plains, its left bank tributary is the [[Chenab]] which itself has four major tributaries, namely, the [[Jhelum River|Jhelum]], the [[Ravi River|Ravi]], the [[Beas River|Beas]] and the [[Sutlej]]. Its principal right bank tributaries are the [[Shyok River|Shyok]], the [[Gilgit River|Gilgit]], the [[Kabul River|Kabul]], the [[Gomal River|Gomal]] and the [[Kurram River|Kurram]]. Beginning in a mountain spring and fed with [[glaciers]] and rivers in the [[Himalayas]], the river supports [[ecosystems]] of temperate forests, [[plain]]s and arid countryside.\n\nThe Sindhu forms the [[Indus River Delta|delta]] of present-day Pakistan mentioned in the [[Vedic]] [[Rigveda]] as ''[[Sapta Sindhu]]'' and the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[Zend Avesta]] as ''[[Hapta Hindu]]'' (both terms meaning \"seven rivers\"). The river has been a source of wonder since the Classical Period, with King [[Darius I|Darius]] of [[Persia]] sending his Greek subject [[Scylax of Caryanda]] to explore the river as early as 510&nbsp;BC.\n\n==Etymology and names==\nThis river was known to the [[ancient Iranians]] in [[Zend Avesta|Avestan]] as ''Hindu'', in Sanskrit as ''Sindhu'', to [[ancient Assyrians|Assyrians]] (as early as the 7th century BC) as ''Sinda'', to the [[Persian people|Persians]] as ''Ab-e-sind'', to the [[Greeks]] as ''Indos'', to the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] as ''Indus'', to the [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]] as ''Abasind'', to the Arabs as ''Al-Sind'', to the Chinese as ''Sintow'', and to the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] as ''[[Santri]]''.{{cn|date=March 2016}} In [[Pali]], ''S\u00edndhu'' means \"river, stream\" and refers to the Indus River in particular.{{sfn|G.P. Malalasekera|2003|p=1137}}\n\nThe word \"Sindhu\" is the romanised form of the [[ancient Greek]] word \"Ind\u00f3s\" (''\u1f38\u03bd\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2''), borrowed from the [[Old Persian language|old Persian]] word \"[[Hindush|Hindu\u0161]]\" which is in turn borrowed from the [[Sanskrit]] word \"Sindhu\".\n\n[[Megasthenes|Megasthenes's]] book ''[[Indica (Arrian)|Indica]]'' derives its name from the river's Greek name, \"Ind\u00f3s\" (''\u1f38\u03bd\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2''), and describes [[Nearchus|Nearchus's]] contemporaneous account of how [[Alexander the Great]] crossed the river. The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] referred to the Indians (people of present-day [[north west India]] and [[Pakistan]]) as \"Ind\u00f3i\" (''\u1f38\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03af''), literally meaning \"the people of the Sindhu\".{{Sfn|Kuiper|2010|p=86}}{{huh|date=March 2016}} The country of [[India]] and the [[Provinces of Pakistan|Pakistani province]] of [[Sindh]] owe their names to the river.{{Sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}{{huh|date=March 2016}}\n\n===Rigveda and the Sindhu===\n[[Rigveda]] also describes several [[Rigvedic rivers|mythical rivers]], including one named \"Sindhu\". The Rigvedic \"Sindhu\" is thought to be the present-day Sindhu river and is attested 176 times in its text \u2013 95 times in the plural, more often used in the generic meaning. In the Rigveda, notably in the later hymns, the meaning of the word is narrowed to refer to the Sindhu river in particular, as in the list of rivers mentioned in the hymn of ''[[Nadistuti sukta]]''. The Rigvedic hymns apply a feminine gender to all the rivers mentioned therein but \"Sindhu\" is the only river attributed with a masculine gender. Sindhu is seen as a strong warrior amongst other rivers which are seen as [[river goddess|goddesses]] and compared to cows and mares yielding milk and butter.\n\n===Other names===\nIn other languages of the region, the river is known as \u0938\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0927\u0941 \u0928\u0926\u0940 ''(Sindhu Nad\u012b)'' in [[Hindi language|Hindi]], \u0633\u0646\u068c\u0648 ''(Sindhu)'' in [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], {{Nastaliq|\u0633\u0646\u062f\u06be}} ''(Sindh)'' in [[Shahmukhi|Shahmukhi Punjabi]], \u0a38\u0a3f\u0a70\u0a27 \u0a28\u0a26\u0a40 ''(Sindh Nad\u012b)'' in [[Gurmukh\u012b|Gurmukh\u012b Punjabi]], \u0627\u0628\u0627\u0633\u064a\u0646 ''([[Abasyn|Ab\u0101sin]],'' lit. \"Father of Rivers\") in [[Pashto language|Pashto]], \u0631\u0648\u062f \u0633\u0646\u062f, ''(Nahar al-Sind)'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], \u0646\u0647\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0646\u062f''(Nahr Alssund'', lit. \"Lion River\") in [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]], {{lang|zh|\u5370\u5ea6}} (''Y\u00ecnd\u00f9'') in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and ''Nilab'' in [[Turki]].\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Babur crossing the Indus in the heat of battle.jpg|thumb|right|[[Babur]] crossing the Sindhu River.]]\nThe Sindhu River provides key water resources for [[economy of Pakistan|Pakistan's economy]] \u2013 especially the ''breadbasket'' of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab province]], which accounts for most of the nation's agricultural production, and Sindh. The word Punjab means \"land of five rivers\" and the five rivers are [[Jhelum River|Jhelum]], [[Chenab River|Chenab]], [[Ravi River|Ravi]], [[Beas River|Beas]] and [[Sutlej River|Sutlej]], all of which finally flow into the Sindhu. The Sindhu also supports many heavy industries and provides the main supply of [[potable water]] in Pakistan.\n\nThe ultimate source of the Sindhu is in [[Tibet]]; the river begins at the confluence of the [[Sengge Zangbo|Sengge]] and Gar rivers that drain the Nganglong Kangri and Gangdise Shan (Gang Rinpoche, Mt. Kailas) mountain ranges. The Sindhu then flows northwest through [[Ladakh]] and [[Baltistan]] into [[Gilgit]], just south of the [[Karakoram]] range. The [[Shyok River|Shyok]], [[Shigar]] and [[Gilgit River|Gilgit]] rivers carry glacial waters into the main river. It gradually bends to the south, coming out of the hills between [[Peshawar]] and [[Rawalpindi]]. The Sindhu passes gigantic gorges {{convert|4500|-|5200|m|ft|sigfig=2|abbr=off}} deep near the [[Nanga Parbat]] [[massif]]. It flows swiftly across [[Hazara, Pakistan|Hazara]] and is dammed at the [[Tarbela Dam|Tarbela Reservoir]]. The [[Kabul River]] joins it near [[Attock]]. The remainder of its route to the sea is in the plains of the Punjab and Sindh, where the flow of the river becomes slow and highly braided. It is joined by the [[Panjnad River|Panjnad]] at [[Mithankot]]. Beyond this confluence, the river, at one time, was named the '''Satnad River''' (''sat'' = \"seven\", ''nad\u012b'' = \"river\"), as the river now carried the waters of the Kabul River, the Sindhu River and the five Punjab rivers. Passing by [[Jamshoro]], it ends in a large delta to the east of [[Thatta]].\n\nThe Sindhu is one of the few rivers in the world to exhibit a [[tidal bore]]. The Sindhu system is largely fed by the snows and glaciers of the [[Himalayas]], Karakoram and the [[Hindu Kush]] ranges of Tibet, the Indian states of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] and [[Himachal Pradesh]] and [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] of Pakistan. The flow of the river is also determined by the seasons \u2013 it diminishes greatly in the winter, while flooding its banks in the [[monsoon]] months from July to September. There is also evidence of a steady shift in the course of the river since prehistoric times \u2013 it deviated westwards from flowing into the [[Rann of Kutch]] and adjoining [[Banni grasslands]] after the 1816 [[earthquake]].<ref>[http:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/city\/ahmedabad\/70-of-cattle-breeders-desert-Banni\/articleshow\/904446.cms 70% of cattle-breeders desert Banni]; by Narandas Thacker, TNN, 14 February 2002; The Times of India<\/ref><ref>[http:\/\/www.india-seminar.com\/2006\/564\/564_c_bharwada_&_v_mahajan.htm Lost and forgotten: grasslands and pastoralists of Gujarat; by Charul Bharwada and Vinay Mahajan; The forsaken drylands; a symposium on some of India's most invisible people; Seminar; New Delhi; 2006; NUMB 564, pages 35\u201339; ISSN 0037-1947], Listed at the [http:\/\/direct.bl.uk\/bld\/PlaceOrder.do?UIN=193508271&ETOC=RN&from=searchengine British Library Online]<\/ref>\n\nThe traditional source of the river is the ''Senge Khabab'' or \"Lion's Mouth\", a perennial spring, not far from the sacred [[Mount Kailash]] marked by a long low line of Tibetan [[chortens]]. There are several other tributaries nearby, which may possibly form a longer stream than Senge Khabab, but unlike the Senger Khabab, are all dependent on [[snowmelt]]. The [[Zanskar River]], which flows into the Sindhu in Ladakh, has a greater volume of water than the Sindhu itself before that point.<ref name=\"Albinia 2008, p. 307\">Albinia (2008), p. 307.<\/ref>\n\n:\"That night in the tent [next to Senge Khabab] I ask Sonmatering which of the Sindhu tributaries which we crossed this morning is the longest. All of them, he says, start at least a day's walk away from here. The Bukhar begins near the village of [[Yagra]]. The Lamolasay's source is in a holy place: there is a monastery there. The Dorjungla is a very difficult and long walk, three days perhaps, and there are many sharp rocks; but it its water is clear and blue, hence the tributary's other name, Zom-chu, which Karma Lama translates as 'Blue Water'. The Rakmajang rises from a dark lake called the Black Sea.\n:One of the longest tributaries \u2014 and thus a candidate for the river's technical source \u2014 is the Kla-chu, the river we crossed yesterday by bridge. Also known as the Lungdep Chu, it flows into the Sindhu from the south-east, and rises a day's walk from Darchen. But Sonamtering insists that the Dorjungla is the longest of the 'three types of water' that fall into the Seng Tsanplo ['Lion River' or Sindhu].\"<ref name=\"Albinia 2008, p. 307\"\/>\n\n==History==\n<!-- citations needed -->\n[[File:Indus sites.png|thumb|250px|right|Sindhu Valley archaeological sites]]\n[[File:IVC Map.png|thumb|280px|Extent and major sites of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Sindhu Valley Civilisation]] 3000&nbsp;BC]]\n{{Main|Indus Valley Civilization|History of Sindh}}\n[[Paleolithic]] sites have been discovered in [[Pothohar]] near Pakistan's capital [[Islamabad]], with the stone tools of the [[Soan Culture]]. In ancient [[Gandhara]], near [[Islamabad]], evidence of cave dwellers dated 15,000&nbsp;years ago has been discovered at [[Mardan]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nThe major cities of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Sindhu Valley Civilisation]], such as [[Harappa]] and [[Mohenjo-daro]], date back to around 3300&nbsp;BC, and represent some of the largest human habitations of the ancient world. The Sindhu Valley Civilisation extended from across Pakistan and northwest India, with an upward reach from east of Jhelum River to [[Ropar]] on the upper Sutlej. The coastal settlements extended from [[Sutkagan Dor]] at the Pakistan, [[Iran]] border to [[Kutch]] in modern [[Gujarat]], India. There is an Sindhu site on the [[Amu Darya]] at Shortughai in northern Afghanistan, and the Sindhu site [[Alamgirpur]] at the [[Hindon River]] is located only {{convert|28|km|0|abbr=on}} from [[Delhi]]. To date, over 1,052 cities and settlements have been found, mainly in the general region of the [[Ghaggar-Hakra River]] and its tributaries. Among the settlements were the major urban centres of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, as well as [[Lothal]], [[Dholavira]], [[Ganeriwala]], and [[Rakhigarhi]]. Only 90\u201396 of more than 800 known Sindhu Valley sites have been discovered on the Sindhu and its tributaries.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The [[Sutlej]], now a tributary of the Sindhu, in Harappan times flowed into the Ghaggar-Hakra River, in the watershed of which were more Harappan sites than along the Sindhu.\n\nMost scholars believe that settlements of [[Gandhara grave culture]] of the early [[Indo-Aryans]] flourished in [[Gandhara]] from 1700&nbsp;BC to 600&nbsp;BC, when [[Mohenjo-daro]] and Harappa had already been abandoned.\n\nThe word [[Etymology of India|\"India\"]] is derived from the Sindhu River. In ancient times, \"India\" initially referred to those regions immediately along the east bank of the Sindhu, but by 300&nbsp;BC, Greek writers including [[Herodotus]] and [[Megasthenes]] were applying the term to the entire subcontinent that extends much farther eastward.<ref>[[Henry Yule]]: [http:\/\/dsal.uchicago.edu\/cgi-bin\/philologic\/getobject.pl?c.1:1:191.hobson ''India, Indies''].

It was crossed by the invading armies of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], but after his [[Macedon]]ians conquered the west bank\u2014joining it to the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] Empire, they elected to retreat along the southern course of the river, ending Alexander's Asian campaign . The Sindhu plains were later dominated by the [[Persian empire]] and then the [[Kushan empire]]. Over several centuries [[Muslim]] armies of [[Muhammad bin Qasim]], [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], [[Mohammed Ghori]], [[Tamerlane]] and [[Babur]] crossed the river to invade the inner regions of the Punjab and points farther south and east.\n\n==Geography==\n{{wide image|Indus Valley near Leh.jpg|850px|The Indus River near Leh, [[Ladakh]], India|center}}\n\n===Tributaries===\n{{Div col||10em}}\n*[[Astor River]]\n*Balram River\n*[[Beas River]]\n*[[Chenab River]]\n*[[Dras River]]\n*Gar River\n*Ghizar River\n*[[Gilgit River]]\n*[[Gomal River]]\n*[[Hunza River]]\n*[[Jhelum River]]\n*[[Kabul River]]\n*[[Kurram River]]\n*[[Nagar River]]\n*[[Panjnad River]]\n*[[Ravi River]]\n*[[Satluj River]]\n*[[Shigar River]]\n*[[Shyok River]]\n*[[Soan River]]\n*Tanubal River\n*[[Zanskar River]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Geology==\n[[File:Indus river from karakouram highway.jpg|thumb|left|River Sindhu viewed from the [[Karakoram Highway]].]]\n[[File:Indus river near Leh.jpg|280px|thumb|Sindhu river near Leh, India, 2014]]\n[[File:IndusZanskar.jpg|280px|thumb|Confluence of Sindhu and Zanskar rivers.

Studies of the sediment in the modern river indicate that the [[Karakoram|Karakoram Mountains]] in northern Pakistan and India are the single most important source of material, with the Himalayas providing the next largest contribution, mostly via the large rivers of the Punjab (Jhelum, Ravi, Chenab, Beas and Sutlej). Analysis of sediments from the Arabian Sea has demonstrated that prior to five million years ago the Sindhu was not connected to these [[Punjab region|Punjab]] rivers which instead flowed east into the [[Ganges]] and were captured after that time.<ref>{{cite journal\n| last        = Clift\n| first       = Peter D.\n|author2=Blusztajn, Jerzy\n| date         =  15 December 2005 |  title       = Reorganization of the western Himalayan river system after five million years ago\n| journal     = Nature\n| volume      = 438\n| pages       = 1001\u20131003\n| doi         = 10.1038\/nature04379\n| pmid        = 16355221\n| issue        = 7070\n}}<\/ref> Earlier work showed that sand and silt from western Tibet was reaching the Arabian Sea by 45&nbsp;million years ago, implying the existence of an ancient Sindhu River by that time.<ref>{{cite journal\n| last        = Clift\n| first       = Peter D.\n|author2=Shimizu, N. |author3=Layne, G.D. |author4=Blusztajn, J.S. |author5=Gaedicke, C. |author6=Schl\u00fcter, H.-U. |author7=Clark, M.K. |author8= Amjad, S. \n|date=August 2001\n| title       = Development of the Indus Fan and its significance for the erosional history of the Western Himalaya and Karakoram\n| journal     = GSA Bulletin\n| volume      = 113\n| issue       = 8\n| pages       = 1039\u20131051\n| doi         = 10.1130\/0016-7606(2001)113<1039:DOTIFA>2.0.CO;2\n}}<\/ref> The delta of this proto-Sindhu river has subsequently been found in the Katawaz Basin, on the Afghan-Pakistan border.\n\nIn the [[Nanga Parbat]] region, the massive amounts of erosion due to the Sindhu river following the capture and rerouting through that area is thought to bring middle and lower crustal rocks to the surface.<ref>{{cite journal\n| last        = Zeitler\n| first       = Peter K.\n| coauthors   = Koons, Peter O.; Bishop, Michael P.; Chamberlain, C.

The Mughal Emperor [[Babur]] writes of encountering rhinoceroses along its bank in his memoirs (the [[Baburnama]]). Extensive [[deforestation]] and human interference in the ecology of the [[Shivalik Hills]] has led to a marked deterioration in vegetation and growing conditions. The Sindhu valley regions are arid with poor vegetation. Agriculture is sustained largely due to irrigation works.\nSindhu river and its watershed has a rich biodiversity. It is home to around 25 amphibian species and 147 species, 22 of which are only found in the Sindhu.<ref>{{cite web|title=Indus River|url=http:\/\/www.unwater.org\/downloads\/worldstop10riversatriskfinalmarch13_1.pdf|work=World' top 10 rivers at risk|publisher=WWF|accessdate=11 July 2012}}<\/ref>\n\n===Mammals===\nThe blind [[Indus River Dolphin|Sindhu River Dolphin]] (''Platanista indicus minor'') is a sub-species of dolphin found only in the Sindhu River.

The population of fish in the river is moderately high, with [[Sukkur]], [[Thatta]] and [[Kotri]] being the major fishing centres \u2013 all in the lower Sindh course. But damming and irrigation has made fish farming an important economic activity. Located southeast of Karachi, the large delta has been recognised by conservationists as one of the world's most important ecological regions. Here the river turns into many marshes, streams and creeks and meets the sea at shallow levels. Here marine fishes are found in abundance, including [[pomfret]] and [[prawns]].\n\n==Economy==\nThe Sindhu is the most important supplier of water resources to the Punjab and Sindh plains \u2013 it forms the backbone of agriculture and food production in Pakistan. The river is especially critical since rainfall is meagre in the lower Sindhu valley. Irrigation canals were first built by the people of the '''[[Indus Valley Civilisation|Sindhu Valley Civilisation]]''', and later by the engineers of the [[Kushan Empire]] and the [[Mughal Empire]]. Modern irrigation was introduced by the [[British East India Company]] in 1850 \u2013 the construction of modern canals accompanied with the restoration of old canals. The British supervised the construction of one of the most complex irrigation networks in the world. The [[Guddu Barrage]] is {{convert|1350|m|abbr=on}} long \u2013 irrigating [[Sukkur]], [[Jacobabad]], [[Larkana]] and [[Kalat District|Kalat]]. The [[Sukkur Barrage]] serves over {{convert|20000|km2|abbr=on}}.\n\nAfter Pakistan came into existence, a water control treaty signed between India and Pakistan in 1960 guaranteed that Pakistan would receive water from the Sindhu River and its two tributaries the [[Jhelum River]] & the [[Chenab River]] independently of upstream control by India.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http:\/\/en.structurae.de\/structures\/data\/index.cfm?ID=s0003769\n|title=Tarabela Dam\n|publisher=www.structurae.the cat in the hat\n|accessdate=2007-07-09\n}}<\/ref>\n\nThe [[Indus Basin Project|Sindhu Basin Project]] consisted primarily of the construction of two main dams, the [[Mangla Dam]] built on the Jhelum River and the [[Tarbela Dam]] constructed on the Sindhu River, together with their subsidiary dams.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http:\/\/www.britannica.com\/eb\/topic-286834\/Indus-Basin-project\n|title=Indus Basin Project\n|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\n|accessdate=2007-07-09\n}}<\/ref> The Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority undertook the construction of the Chashma-Jhelum link canal \u2013 linking the waters of the Sindhu and Jhelum rivers \u2013 extending water supplies to the regions of [[Bahawalpur]] and [[Multan]].

It support the Chashma barrage near Dera Ismail Khan use for irrigation and flood control. for The [[Taunsa Barrage]] near [[Dera Ghazi Khan]] produces 100,000&nbsp;kilowatts of electricity. The extensive linking of tributaries with the Sindhu has helped spread water resources to the valley of [[Peshawar]], in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]. The extensive irrigation and dam projects provide the basis for Pakistan's large production of crops such as [[cotton]], [[sugarcane]] and [[wheat]]. The dams also generate electricity for heavy Sindhutries and urban centres.\n\n==People==\n[[File:Indus near Skardu.jpg|thumb|280px|right|The Sindhu River near [[Skardu]], in [[Gilgit\u2013Baltistan]].]]\n[[File:River Dubair tributary to Indus river.jpeg|280px|thumb|right|The Dubair Khwarr, a tributary of the Sindhu, near [[Shaikhdara]], in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]].]]\nThe inhabitants of the regions through which the Sindhu river passes and forms a major natural feature and resource are diverse in ethnicity, religion, national and linguistic backgrounds. On the northern course of the river in the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] in India, live the [[Buddhist]] people of [[Ladakh]], of [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] stock, and the [[Dards]] of [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] or [[Dard people|Dardic]] stock and practising [[Buddhism]] and [[Islam]]. Then it descends into Baltistan, northern Pakistan passing the main Balti city of [[Skardu]]. A river from Dubair Bala also drains into it at Dubair Bazar. People living in this area are mainly Kohistani and speak the Kohistani language. Major areas through which the Sindhu river passes in [[Kohistan District, Pakistan|Kohistan]] are [[Dasu]], [[Pattan]] and Dubair. As it continues through Pakistan, the [[Indus|Sindhu]] river forms a distinctive boundary of ethnicity and cultures \u2013 upon the western banks the population is largely [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]], [[Baloch people|Baloch]], and of other [[Iranian people|Iranian]] stock. The eastern banks are largely populated by people of [[Indo-Aryan people|Indo-Aryan]] stock, such as the [[Punjabis]] and the [[Sindhis]]. In northern Punjab and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, ethnic Pashtun tribes live alongside [[Dard people|Dardic]] people in the hills ([[Khowar people|Khowar]], [[Kalash people|Kalash]], [[Shina people|Shina]], etc.), Burushos (in [[Hunza Valley|Hunza]]), and [[Punjabi people]].\n\nThe people living along the Sindhu river speak Punjabi and Sindhi on the eastern side (in Punjab and Sindh provinces respectively), Pushto plus Balochi as well as Barohi (in Khyber Pakhtoonkha and Baluchistan provinces). In the province of Sindh, the upper third of the river is inhabited by people speaking Saraiki; which is a somewhat transitional dialect of the Punjabi and Sindhi languages.\n\n==Modern issues==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}\n[[File:Pakistan Indus flooding July 2010 - MODIS.png|thumb|280px|right|Satellite images of the upper Sindhu River valley, comparing water-levels on 1 August 2009 (top) and 31 July 2010 (bottom)]]\nThe Sindhu is a strategically vital resource for Pakistan's economy and society. After [[Pakistan]] and India declared Independence from the [[British Raj]], also known as [[British Raj|Indian Empire]], the use of the waters of the [[Indus|Sindhu]] and its five eastern tributaries became a major dispute between India and Pakistan. The irrigation canals of the [[Sutlej]] valley and the [[Bari Doab]] were split \u2013 with the canals lying primarily in Pakistan and the headwork dams in India disrupting supply in some parts of Pakistan. The concern over India building large dams over various [[Punjab region|Punjab]] rivers that could undercut the supply flowing to Pakistan, as well as the possibility that India could divert rivers in the time of war, caused political consternation in Pakistan. Holding diplomatic talks brokered by the [[World Bank]], India and Pakistan signed the [[Indus Waters Treaty|Sindhu Waters Treaty]] in 1960. The treaty gave India control of the three easternmost rivers of the Punjab, the [[Sutlej]], the [[Beas River|Beas]] and the [[Ravi River|Ravi]], while Pakistan gained control of the three western rivers, the [[Jhelum River|Jhelum]], the [[Chenab]] and the Sindhu. India retained the right to use of the western rivers for non-irrigation projects. (See discussion regarding a recent dispute about a hydroelectric project on the [[Chenab]] (not Sindhu) known as the Baglihar Project).\n\nThere are concerns that extensive deforestation, Sindhutrial pollution and [[global warming]] are affecting the vegetation and wildlife of the Sindhu delta, while affecting agricultural production as well. There are also concerns that the Sindhu river may be shifting its course westwards \u2013 although the progression spans centuries. On numerous occasions, sediment clogging owing to poor maintenance of canals has affected agricultural production and vegetation. In addition, extreme heat has caused water to evaporate, leaving salt deposits that render lands useless for cultivation.\n\nRecently, India's construction of dams on the river, which Pakistan claims is in violation of the Sindhu Waters Treaty reducing water flow into Pakistan, has caused Pakistan to take the issue to the international courts for arbitration.\n\n===Effects of climate change on the river===\nThe [[Tibetan Plateau]] contains the world's third-largest store of ice. Qin Dahe, the former head of the China Meteorological Administration, said the recent fast pace of melting and warmer temperatures will be good for agriculture and tourism in the short term, but issued a strong warning:\n\n::\"Temperatures are rising four times faster than elsewhere in China, and the Tibetan glaciers are retreating at a higher speed than in any other part of the world... In the short term, this will cause lakes to expand and bring floods and mudflows.. In the long run, the glaciers are vital lifelines of the Sindhu River. Once they vanish, water supplies in Pakistan will be in peril.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.google.com\/hostednews\/afp\/article\/ALeqM5g1eE4Xw3njaW1MKpJRYOch4hOdLQ |title=Global warming benefits to Tibet: Chinese official.

[[User talk:Ucucha|Ucucha]] 17:07, 14 August 2010 (UTC)\n:Your assessment is contrary to longstanding content elsewhere on the page, which I started with my old user name, Noroton. Look at the sections on Moose and deer. From the start, some information on variations of various sorts has been part of the article in order to better describe the existence of various species in the state. It is not trivial, for instance, that Fairfield County may (or may not) have the highest concentrations of deer, that moose have caused traffic accidents and deaths, or that the extent of the territory where black bears can be found extends as far south and west as Greenwich. It is not trivial that Stratford has [[white squirrel]]s -- it's a nontrivial fact about the subject of eastern gray squirrels in Connecticut. -- [[User:JohnWBarber|JohnWBarber]] ([[User talk:JohnWBarber|talk]]) 17:15, 14 August 2010 (UTC)\n::I think the pieces about the two deer are also too much for a general list of this nature\u2014this ought to be a list of mammal species in Connecticut, not a list of individual moose seen in Connecticut. I think the Fairfield County example is also different, in that it is not anecdotal\u2014it explicitly compares the county to the rest of the state. [[User talk:Ucucha|Ucucha]] 17:41, 14 August 2010 (UTC)\n:::Please avoid snarky comments on this talk page and in edit summaries. What are you talking about when you say \"two deer\"? You haven't addressed my points about the usefulness of knowing the extent of black bears as far south and west as Greenwich, and it simply is the case that longstanding spotting of white squirrels in Stratford indicates an ongoing population of them in that town. I agree that information in the article about particular places or events should have some purpose in illustrating something worth knowing about some species. Anecdotes can be good illustrations or examples or otherwise reveal some fact worth knowing. If a wolf were found on New Haven Green or in Hartford's downtown Bushnell Park, for instance, that would tell us something worth knowing about wolves in the state. I think the article should be chock-full of that kind of worthwhile information. -- [[User:JohnWBarber|JohnWBarber]] ([[User talk:JohnWBarber|talk]]) 18:07, 14 August 2010 (UTC)\n::::I don't think I've been snarky; if you think I was, it was not my intention, and I'm sorry for it.\n::::\"Two deer\" refers to the two species of deer in Connecticut, the moose and the white-tailed deer. I don't disagree that it is useful to give some of those records, but I think you're going into too much detail; I think it would be enough to say \"[bears have expanded from their core habitat in the state's northwestern hills], with records as far southwest as [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] as of 2010\". As for the squirrels, color variants of the eastern gray are not uncommon as far as I'm aware, and I still don't see their relevance. [[User talk:Ucucha|Ucucha]] 18:29, 14 August 2010 (UTC)\n:::::Follow the link to [[white squirrel]]. Ongoing populations of them are so uncommon that some towns have established festivals around them.

I don't have a problem with rewriting the sentence about Greenwich as you suggest, but I'd add \" where sightings had been reported each year for the past several years.\" because that reinforces the point that the bear was not just passing through, the way, for instance, that the moose appear to have passed through towns in Fairfield County at some points. I would certainly want to include what numbers we have on the growing population of bears over time. In the United States, moose are not commonly called deer. -- [[User:JohnWBarber|JohnWBarber]] ([[User talk:JohnWBarber|talk]]) 18:56, 14 August 2010 (UTC)\n::::::I reworded the piece about the bear.

It is one of Moore's earliest sculptures in two pieces, a mode that he started to adopt in 1959. Its form was inspired by the shape of a bone fragment. Moore created the sculpture from an edition of 10 working models in 1962; these working models are now in public collections. Moore created four full-size casts between 1962-1965, with one retained by him. The three casts are on public display on College Green in Westminster, [[London]], Queen Elizabeth Park in [[Vancouver]], and the garden at [[Kykuit]], the house of the [[Rockefeller family]] in [[Tarrytown, New York]]. Moore's own cast is on display at his former studio and estate, 'Hoglands' in [[Perry Green, Hertfordshire|Perry Green]], Hertfordshire in southern England. A similar work,  ''Mirror Knife Edge 1977'' (or ''Knife Edge Mirror Two Piece''), is displayed at the entrance to [[I. M. Pei]]'s east wing of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The Westminster cast was donated by Moore through the Contemporary Art Society to what he believed was the City of London, but its actual ownership was undetermined for many years. The Westminster cast subsequently fell into disrepair, and was restored in 2013 after it became part of the British Parliamentary Art Collection; it was granted a Grade II* [[listed building|listing]] in January 2016.<ref>[https:\/\/historicengland.org.uk\/listing\/the-list\/list-entry\/1430343 Knife Edge Two Piece Sculpture], Historic England<\/ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Henry Moore Yorkshire Sculpture Park.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Standing Figure (Knife Edge)'', 1961]]\n\nBy 1960 Moore was moving on from his earlier works, directly inspired by the human form and with textured surfaces, such as ''[[Draped Seated Woman 1957\u201358]]'', to more rounded abstract shapes, inspired by the shapes of stones or bones.

This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis.

To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Kace~enwiki that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]]. If you think you might own all of the accounts with this name and this message is in error, please visit [[Special:MergeAccount]] to check and attach all of your accounts to prevent them from being renamed.\n\nYour account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.\n\nSorry for the inconvenience.\n\nYours,<br \/>[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]<br \/>Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation\n<\/div> 01:01, 20 March 2015 (UTC)\n<!-- SUL finalisation notification -->\n\n== Renamed ==\n\n<div class=\"plainlinks mw-content-ltr\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\u201d>\nThis account has been renamed as part of [[m:Special:MyLanguage\/Single User Login finalisation announcement|single-user login finalisation]].

The story, which makes many allusions to the dramatic works of Shakespeare, focuses upon the tragic love affair of \"star-crossed\" lovers Ophelia \"Cocoa\" Day and George Andrews. The setting of the novel is split between New York City, where George was born and raised and Ophelia has recently moved, and Willow Springs: a fictional community situated on a coastal island on the border of Georgia and South Carolina where Ophelia's family has lived for several generations.  The novel takes place within the same fictional universe as some of Naylor's other novels, indicated through its passing references to events and characters from both ''Linden Hills'' and ''Bailey's Cafe.'\n\n== Plot ==\n\n''Mama Day'' centers around the characters George and Cocoa. Cocoa, whose real name is Ophelia, is a young southern woman living in New York who is still deeply connected to her family and ancestry, even though her family's history is fraught with pain and tragedy. George grew up an orphan, overcoming a multitude of challenges in order to finally graduate from Columbia engineering school and co-found his own engineering company.  Cocoa and George meet when Cocoa interviews for job at George's firm. George is unable to hire Cocoa because the job starts immediately and she is obligated to visit Willow Spring Island every August to spend time with Mama Day and her family. Prior to returning to New York from her trip to Willow Springs, Cocoa writes a letter to George saying that she still wants the job. Mama Day intervenes and puts a mysterious substance on the envelope, which causes George to remember Cocoa and soon later recommend her to someone for another job. George and Cocoa begin to date and marry suddenly, but George doesn't visit Willow Springs with Cocoa for four years, during which time Cocoa never shares with him the more unusual and even supernatural aspects of Willow Springs. After several years they return to Willow Springs together. When George finally does accompany her, being a practical minded engineer with no family history or special convictions to help him relate to the people of Willow Springs, he has a hard time believing in or understanding some of the events that take place. When he discovers that Cocoa is dying because of a hex put on her by the deeply jealous and hateful Ruby, who is a conjure woman and Mama Day's wicked counterpart, George wants to use practical means to save her life. Just as Cocoa begins to fall ill, a hurricane knocks out the bridge that is connected to the \"outside\" world, making entering or leaving the island impossible. George and Cocoa are now stuck in Willow Springs, and forced to use the remedies available through Mama Day and the mysticism of the island rather than modern treatment. The only person that can save Cocoa is George, by following the instructions of Mama Day. However, he is unable to surrender to and believe in the mystical forces that Mama Day has described to him, and when he ultimately tries to take matters into his own hands, it leads to tragic ends.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n'''Sapphira Wade''' \u2013 Mama Day's great-grandmother, who is known on the Island as the mystical \"great, great, grand mother.\" The legend of her life is murky, but she is known to have been a slave woman who married Bascombe Wade, bore seven sons, and by some mysterious means gained the deed to the island of Willow Springs from her husband before he died in 1823, from which point the island became a community of free African Americans during the pre-Civil War era.\n\n'''Miranda (Mama) Day''' \u2013 Mama Day is a witty old lady and the matriarch of Willow Springs. Mama Day is Cocoa's Great Aunt and the sister of Abigail. She is a woman who believes in heritage, family, and a deep understanding of the power of nature. Mama Day is often meddling in Cocoa's life and truly wants to see her happy. Mama Day uses magic, nature, wit, and wisdom to help the people of Willow Springs.\n\n'''Abigail Day''' \u2013 Cocoa's grandmother and Mama Day's sister. She is respectful, even tempered and the peace maker of the family. Abigail Day is a doting grandmother that spoils Cocoa.\n\n'''Ophelia (Cocoa) Day''' \u2013 The last living Day of her generation. She is headstrong and stubborn. When the novel opens she has been living in New York City since leaving Willow Springs to go to school seven years earlier, but she goes back to visit for two weeks every August. It is in New York that she meets George Andrews.\n\n''' George Andrews''' \u2013 Cocoa's husband. George is an orphan who grew up in a shelter and knows nothing about his family or ancestry. Hardened by life he takes everything one day at a time, and carefully calculates all of his decisions and actions. He has a heart condition. He doesn't rely on anyone but himself to do things for him. He works at an engineering firm, and is fanatical about football because he's drawn to its detailed strategies. He also has a heart condition that he must monitor closely, which contributes to his need to regulate every aspect of his life.\n\n'''Dr. Buzzard''' \u2013 Is the charlatan of Willow Springs. He brews moonshine and creates other \"remedies\" for various problems and ailments which he sells to the people of Willow Springs. Dr. Buzzard thinks that he and Mama Day are rivals, however Mama Day does not believe that they hold similar powers, or even that his powers are real.\n\n'''Ruby''' \u2013 Ruby is a family friend who is overweight, insecure, jealous and practices voodoo. She uses her powers to manipulate Junior Lee into marrying her.\n\n'''Junior Lee''' \u2013 Married to Ruby. Likes to drink and party, a shiftless individual.\n\n== Style and structure ==\n\n''Mama Day'' is a novel whose subgenres include legend, folklore, mystery, and fantasy.  It contains a multitude of narrative voices which include:\n\n'''1st person plural narration''' \u2013 The Communal voice of the people from Willow Springs is an example of this style. It is also the first one introduced to readers. This voice is best described as an omniscient voice that has been around to see everything.  The introduction and sections throughout the book are written in this voice as the different stories of Bascombe Wade, Sapphira Wade, and what exactly \"18 and 23\" is. For an example of this communal voice is in this sentence from the introduction that states, \"And he coulda listened to them the way you been listening to us right now.\"  Rita Mae Brown states that \"The different voices are beautifully realized but confusing to read.\"<ref name=Brown \/>  As well as the communal voice, Mama Day offers both a 1st person narration and occasionally a free indirect discourse which gives readers direct access to Mama Day's thoughts. Mama Day's section is preceded by three diamonds. In her narration she often speaks about what is taking place at present or events from her past.\n\n'''1st person narration''' \u2013 Cocoa's and George's first person narration which is displayed as a conversation to one another about events that have occurred is the other narrative voice. It switches between the two characters without any evidence other than a brief space between the two sections. It is read as if the readers are overhearing the conversation.  Because of these different narrative viewpoints the novel is filled with dramatic irony, readers see this with the reoccurring imagery and symbolism of the \"chicken\", and \"chicken coup\".\n\nBecause of what Rita Mae Brown feels is a lack of \"self-restraint\" in Mama Day, keeping up with the plot of the novel, and who is speaking the reader is suggested to \"press on doggedly\u2026.[So they can realize] that a plot is developing through these fragmented viewpoints.\"<ref name=Brown \/>\n\nMama Day includes allusions to classical Shakespeare plays such as King Lear \u2013 which is referred to many times by both Cocoa and George, Hamlet who houses a female character by the name of Ophelia, and The Tempest which includes a female character with the same name as Mama Day \u2013 Miranda.  Like Miranda from the Shakespeare play, Mama Day also deals with magic or supernatural powers, and is set on a secluded island. Bharati Mukherjee states that the storyline in Mama Day, like another of Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet, \"concerns star-crossed lovers.\"<ref name=Mukherjee \/>\n\n== Reception ==\n\nUpon its publication, the novel received generally favorable reviews from a number of writers and critics.  [[Rita Mae Brown]]'s review for ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' found the multiple voices in the novel to be \"beautifully realized\" and suggested that readers willing to work through the confusions brought about by its fragmented narrative style would ultimately be rewarded by the book's \"dazzling sense of humor, rich comic observation and that indefinable quality we call 'heart.'\"<ref name=Brown>{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Rita Mae|title=Black Laughter in an Offshore Showoff Novel|url=http:\/\/articles.latimes.com\/1988-03-06\/books\/bk-1035_1_mama-day|accessdate=21 February 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=6 March 1988}}<\/ref>   [[Bharati Mukherjee]], writing for ''[[The New York Times]],'' registered disappointment with the love story between George and Cocoa, which she suggested fell short of Naylor's grand Shakespearean ambitions, but nevertheless commended the work as \"a big, strong, dense, admirable novel.\"<ref name=Mukherjee>{{cite news|last=Mukherjee|first=Bharati|title=There Are Four Sides to Everything|url=http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1988\/02\/21\/books\/there-are-four-sides-to-everything.html|accessdate=21 February 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=21 February 1988}}<\/ref>   Rosellen Brown's review for ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' offered a lukewarm review, describing the plot as \"alternately affecting and silly, though never less than interesting\" and taking issue with Naylor's \"need to elevate by making symbolic, or by fitting everything into a larger scheme\" as well as the author's attempts at \"didactically fostering our spiritual instruction.\"<ref name=Brown2>{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Rosellen|title=Untitled Review|newspaper=Ms.|date=16 February 1988}}<\/ref>   Linda Simon of ''[[Women's Review of Books]]'' commended the originality of Naylor's characters and the book's \"amplitude and wit,\" but her review mainly focused on chiding Naylor for evading important questions about race and gender the novel implicitly raises.<ref name=Simon>{{cite news|last=Simon|first=Linda|title=Black Roots, White Culture|newspaper=Women's Review of Books|date=September 1988}}<\/ref>\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Postmodern books]]\n[[Category:African-American novels]]\n[[Category:1988 novels]]\n[[Category:Novels by Gloria Naylor]]","timestamp":"20160410105552","user-timestamp":"20150410105552"},{"title":"Talk:List of drawings by Rembrandt","content":"{{WikiProject Visual arts |class=List}}","timestamp":"20160410105554","user-timestamp":"20150410105554"},{"title":"User talk:174.115.200.11","content":"\n== April 2011 ==\n\n<div style=clear: both><\/div>[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Welcome to Wikipedia.

Broadly, the extent of the region is the [[Waikato River]] catchment. Other major catchments are those of the [[Waihou River|Waihou]], [[Piako River|Piako]], [[Awakino River|Awakino]] and [[Mokau River|Mokau]] rivers. The region is bounded by [[Auckland Region|Auckland]] on the north, [[Bay of Plenty]] on the east, [[Hawke's Bay region|Hawke's Bay]] on the south-east, and [[Manawatu-Wanganui]] and [[Taranaki Region|Taranaki]] on the south.

It is centred on the Waikato which consists of [[Waikato District]], [[Matamata-Piako District]], [[Waipa District]], [[South Waikato District]] and [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton City]].<ref name=teara_overview\/> In descending order of land area the eleven territorial authorities are Taupo District (part), [[Waitomo District]] (part), Waikato District, [[Thames-Coromandel District]], [[Otorohanga District]], South Waikato District, Matamata-Piako District, Waipa District, [[Hauraki District]], Rotorua District (part), and Hamilton City.\n\nThe name for the region is taken from the Waikato River;  ''waikato'' is a [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] word traditionally translated as \"flowing water\" (specifically, ''wai'' = \"water\" and ''kato'' = \"the pull of the river current in the sea\").<ref name=teara_landmarks>{{cite web |url=http:\/\/www.teara.govt.nz\/en\/waikato-tribes\/2 |title=Waikato tribes \u2013 Waikato landmarks |first=Te Ahukaram\u016b Charles |last=Royal |date=3 May 2010 |work=Te Ara \u2013 the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=10 July 2011}}<\/ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Waikato river 750px.jpg|thumb|225px|left|Waikato River passing through Hamilton]]\n\nTo the west, the region is bounded by the [[Tasman Sea]]. The coastal region is largely rough hill country, known locally as the [[Hakarimata Range]], though it is more gently undulating in the north, closer to the mouth of the Waikato River. The coast is punctured by three large natural harbours: [[Raglan Harbour]], [[Aotea Harbour]], and [[Kawhia Harbour]]. The area around Raglan is noted for its [[volcano|volcanic]] black sand beaches and for its fine [[surfing]] conditions at Manu Bay and [[Ruapuke]] beach.\n\nTo the east of the coastal hills lies the broad [[floodplain]] of the Waikato River. This region has a wet temperate climate, and the land is largely pastoral farmland created by European settlers draining the extensive natural swamps, although it also contains undrained [[peat]] [[swamp]] such as the 200km2 peat dome south of Ngatea. It is in the broad undulating [[Waikato Plains]] that most of the region's population resides, and the land is intensively farmed with both livestock, mainly [[dairy]] cattle but with sheep farming on the hillier west margins, and crops such as [[maize]]. The area around [[Cambridge, New Zealand|Cambridge]] has many [[Thoroughbred horse race|thoroughbred]] stables.\n\nThe north of the region around [[Te Kauwhata]] produces some of New Zealand's best [[wine]]s. Dozens of small  shallow lakes lie in this area, the largest of which is [[Lake Waikare]].\n\nTo the east, the land rises towards the forested slopes of the [[Kaimai Ranges|Kaimai]] and [[Mamaku Ranges]]. The upper reaches of the Waikato River are used for [[hydroelectricity]], helped by several large artificial lakes in the region's south-east. The lowest and earliest-created such lake is [[Lake Karapiro]], now developed as a world-class rowing centre, where the world championships were held in 2010. The river flows out of the country's largest lake, [[Lake Taupo]], which is served by several important fishing rivers such as the [[Tongariro River|Tongariro]], on the [[North Island Volcanic Plateau|Central Plateau]], draining the eastern side of [[Mount Ruapehu]] and its neighbours.\n\nThe climate is mild and temperate with moderate rainfall of 1200\u20131600mm per annum, with the higher western hills having the most rain. Summers are drier with maximum temperatures of 25\u201328 degrees Celsius. Summer droughts occur one year in ten. Winter maxima are 12\u201315 degrees Celsius. The lower areas experience regular morning fog, under anticyclonic conditions, which burns off by late morning to produce many still, clear sunny days. Morning frosts are also common during winter anticyclones. Another distinctive feature is the low average wind speed in the interior basin due to the sheltering influence of the hills and mountains to the west and south-west. The prevailing winter wind is from the south-west. The Waikato has very high sunshine hours by world standards, averaging 2200 hours per year or about 40% higher than in the UK. This results in rapid growth of grass, crops and ornamental plants.\n\n==Demographics==\n===Cities and towns===\n{{Main|List of localities in Waikato}}\n\n[[File:WaikatoRegionPopulationDensity.png|thumb|220px|Map of population density in the Waikato region (2006 census)]]\nThe largest city in the Waikato Region is [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]], with an urban and peri-urban population of {{NZ population data|Hamilton Zone|y|y||(|)}}.<ref name=\"NZ_population_data\"\/> It is home to the [[University of Waikato]] and the [[Waikato Institute of Technology]] (Wintec).\n\nOther major towns in the region are [[Tokoroa]], [[Te Awamutu]], [[Cambridge, New Zealand|Cambridge]] and [[Taupo]] with respective populations of {{NZ population data|Tokoroa|y}}, {{NZ population data|Te Awamutu Zone|y}}, {{NZ population data|Cambridge Zone|y}} and {{NZ population data|Taupo|y}}.

Gross regional product (GRP) for the year ended March 2007 was estimated to be $15,606 million compared with $12,493 million in March 2004.<ref name=\"2009 Waikato Economic Report\">{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.waikatoregion.govt.nz\/Publications\/Technical-Reports\/TR-200926\/|title=2009 Waikato Economic Report|publisher=[[Waikato Regional Council]]|year=2009|accessdate=18 February 2010}}<\/ref>\n\nBetween 2000 and 2004, Waikato economic growth was lower than the national average. But from 2004 to 2007, real gross regional product for the Waikato Region increased by 5 per cent per year compared with 3.2 per cent for the national average. This faster growth can be attributed to rapidly growing dairy and business services industries, facilitated by proximity to the Auckland city, the main international gateway for New Zealand.<ref name=\"2009 Waikato Economic Report\"\/>\n\nGiven the suitable geography and climate, the Waikato economy is strongly based on agriculture, especially dairy. Dairy farming has been the main agricultural activity since the late nineteenth century. Within the Waikato region, small co-operative dairy companies where widespread during the 20th century.  Towards the end of the 20th century, frequent mergers of co-operative dairy companies occurred, which ultimately ended in the formation of New Zealand wide dairy co-operative [[Fonterra]] in 2001. In 2007, dairy farming and dairy processing combined contributed $2 billion (13%) to GRP. Business services is the second largest sector in the Waikato Region, contributing $1.2 billion or 8 per cent of GRP in 2007.\n\nDairy farms are mainly family owned with owners employing sharemilkers in many cases. The size of the average dairy herd in the Waikato has progressively increased and is now about 320 cows,<ref>http:\/\/www.lic.co.nz\/pdf\/DAIRY%20STATISTICS%2010-11-WEB.pdf<\/ref> milked in either a herringbone or automated rotary cowshed so a large herd can be milked in under two hours. The cows are kept on grassland pasture all year due to the mild climate. In the Waikato the original English grasses used by earlier settlers \u2013 [[browntop]], [[fescue]] and [[Yorkshire Fog]] \u2013 have been replaced with higher producing Italian ryegrass and nitrogen-fixing white clover. Farmers use a variety of supplementary feeds in winter or during the infrequent summer droughts. Main feeds are hay, grass silage and chopped corn feed. The later is often fed out on a concrete pad to save transportation and wastage by trampling.\n\n==History==\nBefore the arrival of Europeans, the Waikato contained the third most densely populated part of New Zealand, after Northland\/Auckland and the Bay of Plenty. The Waikato ''rohe'' (area) was inhabited by ''[[iwi]]'' (tribes) such as those of the [[Tainui]] confederation, including [[Waikato (iwi)|Waikato]] and [[Ng\u0101ti Toa]] who conquered the native inhabitants about 1450 according to Tainui historians, finally destroying them at a battle at Aratiatia. Between about 1750 and 1842 the area was subject to a large number of invasions by other  M\u0101ori iwi and hapu confederations and large scale population migrations took place by a number of ''[[hapu]]'' and ''iwi''. The largest battle ever fought in New Zealand took place near Ohaupo about 1790-1805, between two competing alliances of ''hapu''. During the latter stages of this volatile period, known as the [[Musket Wars]] (1807\u20131845), conflict led to a migration south to [[Taranaki Region|Taranaki]] and eventually Kapiti Island.\n\nIn 1840 44 Waikato chiefs travelled north to the Manukau Heads and Manukau Harbour to sign the Treaty of Waitangi, officially making the Waikato area part of New Zealand.Three Ngati Maniapoto chiefs signed, as did three Ngati Haua chiefs but most signatories were Waikato. Chief Te Whero whero did not sign, \"probably due to the lack of dignity compared to the Waitangi event\". Unusually, the copy signed was in English.<ref>NZ History. Waikato -Manakau Treaty copy.Updated 19 Feb. 2016.<\/ref> Between 1840 and 1860 the CMS missionaries of the Anglican church assisted Waikato Maori in revolutionizing their economy in the Kihikihi area by the introduction of such crops as peaches, maize and wheat. Missionaries bought in millers and helped Maori establish eight flour mills. These flourished until 1857, as they provided flour for the growing Auckland market in the 1850s and for a brief while were exporting to Australia. The route used to travel to and from Auckland was by dray to the Puniu stream, along the Waipa River to its junction with the Waikato. Near the Waikato Heads travellers entered the small Awaroa River. During summer it was necessary to push or pull the waka through to the Manukau Harbour at Waiuku. By 1850s a small bullock track had been established to Auckland via the settlements of Mauku, Drury, Papakura and Otahuhu or waka could take the sea route across the Manukau to Ihumatao (where Auckland International Airport is now).<ref>J.Gorst. The Maori King, P11 and Map. Reed. 2001.<\/ref> The main tribe to use this route and the main traders were the Maniapoto tribe. They occupied an area of fertile land south of Te Awamutu at Kihikihi and Rangiaowhia.  Maniapoto sold wheat, peaches, potatoes and other food to Auckland and bought back shirts, sugar, tobacco and rum.<ref>J.Gorst. The Maori King. P13. Reed 2001<\/ref> The boom time ended in 1856-1857 with the end of the Australian gold rush, allowing importing of cheaper food, especially flour, from Australia. Even in the boom time of 1854-55, food grown by Waikato Maori, such as Ngati Maniapoto, was taken to the Auckland market in very small amounts compared to food from the Waiheke Island -Thames area. In early 1855 Ngati Maniapoto took only 3 canoes of potatoes to Auckland compared to 279 canoes containing a much wider variety of food from the Thames area.<ref>Maori Enterprise to c1860. Hazel Petrie.<\/ref> Missionaries had also established schools for Maori. Benjamin and Harriet Ashwell ran a school for 50 Maori girls aged 6\u201317 at Taupiri in 1853. The girls had been at the school for up to 3 years and could read and write in English and do mental arithmetic.<ref>The Voyagers.P Moon. p 62.Penguin 2014.<\/ref>\n\nAt the time of the [[Invasion of Waikato|Waikato campaign]] of 1863 against the rebel [[M\u0101ori King Movement]] forces, the population was estimated by the government at about 3,500 M\u0101ori.\n\nDuring the late 1850s Maniapoto in particular become disgruntled in their dealings with Pakeha. They complained about the way they were treated in Auckland by traders but their chief compliant was that the government was underpaying them for land they were selling. The average price paid by government was 6d per acre but it was sold to settlers for 10\/- per acre. The government argued that it had to pay for surveying and administration costs but to Maori it seemed unfair. Before the elevation of the first Maori king there was a wide range of opinions amongst influential Maori with some such as Wirimu Tamihana's father advocating supporting the Crown while Te Heuheu of Tuwharetoa advocated all out war against the government.<ref>J Gorst. The Maori King p 34, 35, 40. Reed 2001.<\/ref> This view was initially unpopular as the king movement hoped to work alongside the crown. Maori were upset at the number of children that had been fathered by Pakeha who had then disappeared. The children were left to be raised by their mothers with general hapu support. John Gorst, a well educated government agent, reported significant numbers of half cast children in the Waikato in the late 1850s. However, in the Ngati Maniapoto iwi at least 7 Pakeha integrated successfully with the tribe from 1842, marrying Maori women. The best known are William Searancke who became an important government agent and Frenchman Louis Hetet who became a successful trader. Their half caste children lived with the iwi and some became leading figures.\n\nWhat tipped the balance was conflict and criminal activity within the Waikato region. Influential chiefs said the treaty had promised the government would help maintain peace. They asked for government magistrates and courts. The government attempted to fulfill these requests but many of the young men who put themselves forward  for the positions simply saw that they had an opportunity to get wealthy at the government's expense. This upset the older chiefs who wanted the strong Maori leader Te Wherowhero to return from Mangere to his lands at Tamahere (South Hamilton) to rein in the out of control young chief magistrates.<ref>J Gorst. The Maori King. P 39-49. Reed 2001.<\/ref>\n\nThe Waikato has a prominent history, particularly regarding relationships between M\u0101ori and European in early colonial New Zealand. The Waikato was within the defined boundaries of the colonial provinces of [[New Ulster Province|New Ulster]] (1841\u20131853) and [[Auckland Province|Auckland]] (1853\u20131876) but was principally M\u0101ori. During the [[New Zealand wars|land wars]] of the 1860s, the Waikato was the scene of five battles in what is referred to as the [[Invasion of the Waikato]]. In retaliation for the help Waikato M\u0101ori (mainly [[Ng\u0101ti Maniapoto]]) gave Taranaki M\u0101ori in their conflict over land in the earlier [[First Taranaki War]], and the decision by some Waikato ''hapu'' to form a separate kingdom \u2013 the King Movement or ''Kingitanga'' \u2013 in opposition to the government, the colonial government, with the help of troops brought from Britain and Queenite M\u0101ori loyal to the Crown, pushed south from the main settlement of [[Auckland]], fighting against Waikato raiders in Auckland before venturing into the Waikato to attack the combined ''hapu'' of the King Movement. During 1863 and 1864 fighting occurred at Pukekohe East, Titi hill, Burtts Farm, Galloway Redoubt, Kiri Kiri, Martyn's Farm, Patumahoe, Rhodes Clearing, Williamson's Clearing, Otau, Camerontown, Kakaramea and Wairoa ranges (all Auckland), [[Meremere]], Rangiriri, Ngaruawahia, Rangiaowhia (southwest of Cambridge), Hairini Ridge and Orakau (near Kihikihi), all resulting in defeat for the ''Kingitanga'' forces. Eventually the rebel King Movement forces pulled back to positions in the area to the south of the Punui River in South Waikato, still known as the [[King Country]], after 19 defeats by the British. ''[[Rewi's Last Stand]]'', one of New Zealand's first [[motion pictures]], in 1925, portrayed an entertaining, fictionalized version of the Orakau siege.\n\nThe headquarters of the M\u0101ori King Movement are now at [[Turangawaewae]] Marae at [[Ngaruawahia]].\n\nAfter the end of the war and the withdrawal of British and Australian troops, the region experienced a long period of economic recession after 1866. Most Maori had moved to the King Country and European settlers were more attracted to the South Island with its large gold discovery in Otago and the more easily farmed Canterbury Plains. The Waikato had poor land access and was not suitable for sheep farming which dominated livestock production in New Zealand until the 1890s invention of refrigeration. Dairying and the completion of the main trunk railway line at the turn of the century lead to a small, steady increase in population. After 1900 the Waikato continued to grow as a dairying region benefiting from the flow of capital earned from the sale of butter and cheese mainly to Britain.\n\n== Politics ==\nIn the 2010 local government elections, the Waikato Region had the country's lowest rate of returned votes, with only 30.8 per cent voting in the Waikato District Council elections and 33.6 per cent in Hamilton City.<ref>{{cite news |title=Voter turnout up in local elections |url= http:\/\/www.nzherald.co.nz\/nz\/news\/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10680766 |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=15 October 2010 |accessdate=16 October 2010 |first=Paul |last=Harper}}<\/ref>\n\n==People==\nThe people of the Waikato use the nickname [[Mooloo]] to apply to themselves or to their region, particularly in relation to sporting endeavours.

MUSCL stands for ''Monotonic Upstream-Centered Scheme for Conservation Laws'' (van Leer, 1979), and the term was introduced in a seminal paper by [[Bram van Leer]] (van Leer, 1979). In this paper he constructed the first ''high-order'', ''[[total variation diminishing]]'' (TVD) scheme where he obtained second order spatial accuracy.\n\nThe idea is to replace the piecewise constant approximation of [[Godunov's scheme]] by reconstructed states, derived from cell-averaged states obtained from the previous time-step. For each cell, slope limited, reconstructed left and right states are obtained and used to calculate fluxes at the cell boundaries (edges). These fluxes can, in turn, be used as input to a ''[[Riemann solver]]'', following which the solutions are averaged and used to advance the solution in time. Alternatively, the fluxes can be used in ''Riemann-solver-free'' schemes, such as the ''Kurganov and Tadmor scheme'' outlined below.\n\n==Linear reconstruction==\n\n[[Image:StepFirstOrdUpwind.png|thumb|1D advective equation <math>u_t+u_x=0<\/math>, with step wave propagating to the right.

Shows the analytical solution along with a simulation based upon a first order upwind spatial discretization scheme.]]\n\nWe will consider the fundamentals of the MUSCL scheme by considering the following simple first-order, scalar, 1D system, which is assumed to have a wave propagating in the positive direction,\n\n:<math>u_t + F_x\\left(u \\right)=0. \\, <\/math>\n\nWhere <math>u<\/math> represents a state variable and <math>F<\/math> represents a [[flux]] variable.\n\nThe basic scheme of Godunov uses piecewise constant approximations for each cell, and results in a first-order upwind discretisation of the above problem with cell centres indexed as <math>i<\/math>.  A semi-discrete scheme can be defined as follows,\n\n:<math>\\frac{d u_i}{d t} + \\frac{1}{\\Delta x_i} \\left[ \nF \\left( u_{i} \\right) - F \\left( u_{i+1} \\right)  \\right] =0. <\/math>\n\nThis basic scheme is not able to handle shocks or sharp discontinuities as they tend to become smeared. An example of this effect is shown in the diagram opposite, which illustrates a 1D advective equation with a step wave propagating to the right. The simulation was carried out with a mesh of 200 cells and used a 4th order [[Runge\u2013Kutta]] time integrator (RK4).\n\nTo provide higher resolution of discontinuities, Godunov's scheme can be extended to use piecewise linear approximations of each cell, which results in a ''central difference'' scheme that is ''second-order'' accurate in space. The piecewise linear approximations are obtained from\n\n:<math> u \\left( x \\right) = u_{i} +\n  \\frac{\\left( x - x_{i} \\right) }{ \\left( x_{i+1} - x_{i} \\right)}\n  \\left( u_{i+1} - u_{i}  \\right) \\qquad \\forall x \\in (x_{i}, x_{i+1}].<\/math>\n\nThus, evaluating fluxes at the cell edges we get the following semi-discrete scheme\n\n:<math>\\frac{d u_i}{d t} + \\frac{1}{\\Delta x_i} \\left[ \nF \\left( u_{i + 1\/2} \\right) - F \\left( u_{i - 1\/2} \\right)  \\right] =0, <\/math>\n\n[[Image:stepSecOrdCentralDifference.png|thumb|1D advective equation <math>u_t+u_x=0<\/math>, with step wave propagating to the right.

An example of this effect is shown in the diagram opposite, which illustrates a 1D advective equation <math>\\, u_t+u_x=0 <\/math>, with a step wave propagating to the right. This loss of accuracy is to be expected due to [[Godunov's theorem]]. The simulation was carried out with a mesh of 200 cells and used RK4 for time integration.\n\n[[Image:LinExtrap.jpg|thumb|An example of MUSCL type left and right state linear-extrapolation.|200px|right|An example of MUSCL type left and right state linear-extrapolation.]]\n\nMUSCL based numerical schemes extend the idea of using a linear piecewise approximation to each cell by using ''slope limited'' left and right extrapolated states. This results in the following high resolution, TVD discretisation scheme,\n\n:<math>\\frac{d u_i}{d t} + \\frac{1}{\\Delta x_i} \\left[ \nF \\left( u^*_{i + 1\/2} \\right) - F \\left( u^*_{i - 1\/2} \\right)  \\right] =0. <\/math>\n\nWhich, alternatively, can be written in the more succinct form,\n\n:<math>\\frac{d u_i}{d t} + \\frac{1}{\\Delta x_i} \\left[ \nF^*_{i + 1\/2}  - F^*_{i - 1\/2}  \\right] =0. <\/math>\n\nThe numerical fluxes <math>F^*_{i \\pm 1\/2} <\/math> correspond to a nonlinear combination of first and second-order approximations to the continuous flux function.\n\nThe symbols <math> u^*_{i + 1\/2} <\/math> and <math> u^*_{i - 1\/2} <\/math> represent scheme dependent functions (of the limited extrapolated cell edge variables), i.e.\n\n:<math> u^*_{i + 1\/2} = u^*_{i + 1\/2}  \\left( u^L_{i + 1\/2} , u^R_{i + 1\/2}  \\right),\n\n  u^*_{i - 1\/2} = u^*_{i - 1\/2}  \\left( u^L_{i - 1\/2} , u^R_{i - 1\/2}  \\right), <\/math>\n\nand\n:<math> u^L_{i + 1\/2} = u_i + 0.5 \\phi \\left( r_i \\right) \\left( u_{i} - u_{i-1} \\right),\n  u^R_{i + 1\/2} = u_{i+1} - 0.5 \\phi \\left( r_{i} \\right)  \\left( u_{i+1} - u_{i} \\right),<\/math>\n\n:<math> u^L_{i - 1\/2} = u_{i-1} + 0.5 \\phi \\left( r_{i-1} \\right)  \\left( u_i - u_{i-1} \\right),\n  u^R_{i - 1\/2} = u_i - 0.5 \\phi \\left( r_i \\right)  \\left( u_{i+1} - u_i \\right),<\/math>\n\n:<math> r_{i} = \\frac{u_i - u_{i-1}}{u_{i+1} - u_i}.<\/math>\n\nThe function <math>\\phi \\left( r_i \\right)<\/math> is a limiter function that limits the slope of the piecewise approximations to ensure the solution is TVD, thereby avoiding the spurious oscillations that would otherwise occur around discontinuities or shocks - see [[Flux limiter]] section. The limiter is equal to zero when <math>r \\le 0<\/math> and is equal to unity when <math>r = 1<\/math>. Thus, the accuracy of a TVD discretization degrades to first order at local extrema, but tends to second order over smooth parts of the domain.\n\nThe algorithm is straight forward to implement. Once a suitable scheme for <math>F^*_{i + 1\/2}<\/math> has been chosen, such as the ''Kurganov and Tadmor scheme'' (see below), the solution can proceed using standard numerical integration techniques.\n\n==Kurganov and Tadmor central scheme==\n\nA precursor to the ''Kurganov and Tadmor'' (KT) ''central scheme'', (Kurganov and Tadmor, 2000), is the ''Nessyahu and Tadmor'' (NT) ''central scheme'', (Nessyahu and Tadmor, 1990).  It is a Riemann-solver-free, second-order, [[high-resolution scheme]] that uses MUSCL reconstruction.  It is a fully discrete method that is straight forward to implement and can be used on [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] and [[vector (geometric)|vector]] problems, and can be viewed as a modification to the ''Lax-Friedrichs'' (LxF) ''scheme''.  The algorithm is based upon [[finite difference|central differences]] with comparable performance to Riemann type solvers when used to obtain solutions for PDE's describing systems that exhibit high-gradient phenomena.\n\nThe KT scheme extends the NT scheme and has a smaller amount of numerical viscosity than the original NT scheme. It also has the added advantage that it can be implemented as either a ''fully discrete'' or ''semi-discrete'' scheme. Here we consider the semi-discrete scheme.\n\nThe calculation is shown below:\n: <math>F^*_{i-\\frac{1}{2}} =\\frac{1}{2} \\left\\{\n\\left[ F \\left(u^R_{i - \\frac{1}{2}} \\right) + F \\left(u^L_{i - \\frac{1}{2}} \\right) \\right]\n- a_{i - \\frac{1}{2} } \\left[u^R_{i - \\frac{1}{2}} - u^L_{i - \\frac{1}{2}} \\right] \\right\\}. <\/math>\n \n: <math>F^*_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} =\\frac{1}{2} \\left\\{\n\\left[ F \\left(u^R_{i + \\frac{1}{2}} \\right) + F \\left(u^L_{i + \\frac{1}{2}} \\right) \\right]\n- a_{i + \\frac{1}{2} } \\left[u^R_{i + \\frac{1}{2}} - u^L_{i + \\frac{1}{2}} \\right] \\right\\}. <\/math>\n\n[[Image:StepKTsuperbee.png|thumb|1D advective equation with step wave <math>u_t+u_x=0<\/math>, propagating to the right.

The simulation was carried out on a mesh of 200 cells, using the Kurganov and Tadmor central scheme with [[flux limiter|Superbee limiter]] and used RK-4 for time integration. This simulation result contrasts extremely well against the above first-order upwind and second-order central difference results shown above. This scheme also provides good results when applied to sets of equations - see results below for this scheme applied to the Euler equations. However, care has to be taken in choosing an appropriate limiter because, for example, the Superbee limiter can cause unrealistic sharpening for some smooth waves.\n\nThe scheme can readily include diffusion terms, if they are present. For example, if the above 1D scalar problem is extended to include a diffusion term, we get\n\n:<math>u_t + F_x\\left(u \\right) = Q_x \\left( u , u_x \\right), <\/math>\n\nfor which Kurganov and Tadmor propose the following central difference approximation,\n\n:<math>\\frac{d u_i}{d t} = \n- \\frac{1}{\\Delta x_i} \\left[ F^*_{i + \\frac{1}{2}}  - F^*_{i - \\frac{1}{2}}  \\right] \n+ \\frac{1}{\\Delta x_i} \\left[ P_{i + \\frac{1}{2}}  - P_{i - \\frac{1}{2}}  \\right]. <\/math>\n\nWhere,\n\n:<math>P_{i + \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \nQ \\left( u_{i} ,   \\frac{u_{i+1} - u_i}{\\Delta x_i} \\right) + \nQ \\left( u_{i+1} , \\frac{u_{i+1} - u_i}{\\Delta x_i} \\right)\n   \\right], <\/math>\n\n:<math>P_{i - \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \nQ \\left( u_{i-1} ,   \\frac{u_{i} - u_{i-1}}{\\Delta x_{i-1}} \\right) + \nQ \\left( u_{i} , \\frac{u_{i} - u_{i-1}}{\\Delta x_{i-1}} \\right).\n   \\right] <\/math>\n\nFull details of the algorithm (''full'' and ''semi-discrete'' versions) and its derivation can be found in the original paper (Kurganov and Tadmor, 2000), along with a number of 1D and 2D examples. Additional information is also available in the earlier related paper by Nessyahu and Tadmor (1990).\n\n'''Note:'''  This scheme was originally presented by Kurganov and Tadmor as a 2nd order scheme based upon ''linear extrapolation''.  A later paper (Kurganov and Levy, 2000) demonstrates that it can also form the basis of a third order scheme. A 1D advective example and an Euler equation example of their scheme, using parabolic reconstruction (3rd order), are shown in the ''parabolic reconstruction'' and ''Euler equation'' sections below.\n\n==Piecewise parabolic reconstruction==\n\n[[Image:ParabolicExtrap.jpg|thumb|An example of MUSCL type state parabolic-reconstruction.|200px|right|An example of MUSCL type state parabolic-reconstruction.]]\n\nIt is possible to extend the idea of linear-extrapolation to higher order reconstruction, and an example is shown in the diagram opposite. However, for this case the left and right states are estimated by interpolation of a second-order, upwind biased, difference equation. This results in a parabolic reconstruction scheme that is third-order accurate in space.\n\nWe follow the approach of Kermani (Kermani, et al., 2003), and present a third-order upwind biased scheme, where the symbols <math> u^*_{i + \\frac{1}{2}} <\/math> and <math> u^*_{i - \\frac{1}{2}} <\/math> again represent scheme dependent functions (of the limited reconstructed cell edge variables).

This has the effect of raising the spatial solution of the KT scheme to 3rd order. It performs well when solving the Euler equations, see below. This increase in spatial order has certain advantages over 2nd order schemes for smooth solutions, however, for shocks it is more dissipative - compare diagram opposite with above solution obtained using the KT algorithm with linear extrapolation and Superbee limiter. This simulation was carried out on a mesh of 200 cells using the same KT algorithm but with parabolic reconstruction.

Therefore, in conservation vector form, the general [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] reduce to\n\n:<math> \n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{U}}{\\partial t}+\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{F}}{\\partial x}=0,\n<\/math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{U}=\\begin{pmatrix}\\rho  \\\\  \\rho u  \\\\  E\\end{pmatrix}\\qquad\n\\mathbf{F}=\\begin{pmatrix}\\rho u\\\\p+\\rho u^2\\\\  u(E+p)\\end{pmatrix},\\qquad\n<\/math>\nand where '''<math> \\mbox{U} <\/math>''' is a vector of states and '''<math> \\mbox{F} <\/math>''' is a vector of fluxes.\n\nThe equations above represent conservation of '''mass''', '''momentum''', and '''energy'''.  There are thus three equations and four unknowns, <math> \\rho <\/math> (density) <math> u <\/math> (fluid velocity), <math> p <\/math> (pressure) and <math> E <\/math> (total energy). The total energy is given by,\n\n:<math>E=\\rho e + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho u^2,<\/math>\n\nwhere <math> e\\ <\/math> represents specific internal energy.\n\nIn order to close the system an [[equation of state]] is required. One that suits our purpose is\n\n:<math>p=\\rho \\left(\\gamma-1 \\right)e,<\/math>\n\nwhere <math> \\gamma\\ <\/math> is equal to the ratio of specific heats <math> \\left[ c_p\/c_v \\right] <\/math> for the fluid.\n\nWe can now proceed, as shown above in the simple 1D example, by obtaining the left and right extrapolated states for each state variable. Thus, for density we obtain\n\n:<math> \\rho^*_{i + \\frac{1}{2}} = \\rho^*_{i + \\frac{1}{2}}  \\left( \\rho^L_{i + \\frac{1}{2}} , \\rho^R_{i + \\frac{1}{2}}  \\right),\n\n  \\rho^*_{i - \\frac{1}{2}} = \\rho^*_{i - \\frac{1}{2}}  \\left( \\rho^L_{i - \\frac{1}{2}} , \\rho^R_{i - \\frac{1}{2}}  \\right), <\/math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math> \\rho^L_{i + \\frac{1}{2}} = \\rho_{i}   + 0.5 \\phi \\left( r_{i} \\right) \\left( \\rho_{i+1} - \\rho_{i} \\right),\n  \\rho^R_{i + \\frac{1}{2}} = \\rho_{i+1} - 0.5 \\phi \\left( r_{i+1} \\right)  \\left( \\rho_{i+2} - \\rho_{i+1} \\right),<\/math>\n\n:<math> \\rho^L_{i - \\frac{1}{2}} = \\rho_{i-1} + 0.5 \\phi \\left( r_{i-1} \\right)  \\left( \\rho_{i} - \\rho_{i-1} \\right),\n  \\rho^R_{i - \\frac{1}{2}} = \\rho_{i}   - 0.5 \\phi \\left( r_{i} \\right)  \\left( \\rho_{i+1} - \\rho_{i} \\right).<\/math>\n\nSimilarly, for momentum <math> \\rho u <\/math>, and total energy <math> E <\/math>. Velocity <math> u <\/math>, is calculated from momentum, and pressure <math> p <\/math>, is calculated from the equation of state.\n\nHaving obtained the limited extrapolated states, we then proceed to construct the edge fluxes using these values. With the edge fluxes known, we can now construct the semi-discrete scheme, i.e.\n\n:<math>\\frac{d \\mathbf{U}_i}{d t} = - \\frac{1}{\\Delta x_i} \\left[ \n\\mathbf{F}^*_{i + \\frac{1}{2} }  - \\mathbf{F}^*_{i - \\frac{1}{2}}  \\right]. <\/math>\n\nThe solution can now proceed by integration using standard numerical techniques.\n\nThe above illustrates the basic idea of the MUSCL scheme. However, for a practical solution to the Euler equations, a suitable scheme (such as the above KT scheme), also has to be chosen in order to define the function <math>\\mathbf{F}^*_{i \\pm \\frac{1}{2} } <\/math>.\n\n[[Image:sodProbKTospre.png|thumb|High resolution simulation of Euler equations based on G A Sod's 'Shock Tube' problem.

She was the namesake of her aunt [[Agnes of Aquitaine, Queen of Aragon and Navarre|Agnes]], wife of King [[Peter I of Aragon and Navarre]].

This man was a monk, and his name was Ramiro. They gave him the sister of the Count of Poitiers for a wife. Even though this was a great sin, the Aragonese did it, for they had lost their king and hoped that there would be an offspring from the royal family. . . King Ramiro went to his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to a daughter. . . He transferred the kingdom to his daughter and acknowledged his sins. He then did penance.{{sfn|Lipskey|1972|p=84 (book I, \u00a762)}}<!--According to the ''[[Gesta comitum Barcinonensium]]'', Ramiro married \"a sister of the count of Poitiers\" (''sororem comitis Pictaviensis'').--><\/blockquote>\nAgnes' age (approximately thirty) and proven fertility in her prior marriage were probably the main reasons the Aragonese sought her out.{{sfn|Lourie|1975|p=640}} Agnes' brother, [[William X of Aquitaine|Duke William X]], was also one of the few regional supporters of [[Antipope Anacletus II]], who, as the weaker claimant to the papacy, might be persuaded to support Ramiro's irregular (and uncanonical) accession.{{sfn|Reilly|1998|p=53}} Agnes' dowry was a church at [[Loscertales]].\n\nIn a document from the same month as his marriage, Ramiro declares that he \"took a wife not out of carnal lust, but for the restoration of the blood and the lineage\" (''uxorem quoque non carnis libidine, set sanguinis ac proienici restauratione duxi'').{{sfn|Ubieto Arteta|1987|p=128\u201332}} Later medieval and early modern historians, embarrassed by the disregard for [[canon law]], invented explanations to reconcile the marriage of a bishop with what was current in their own day. The fourteenth-century ''[[Chronicle of San Juan de la Pe\u00f1a]]'' records that messengers were sent to the pope to obtain the proper dispensation.{{sfn|Ubieto Arteta|1987|p=128\u201332}} The Aragonese translation of the same chronicle places Ramiro's religious status in doubt (\"some chronicles say that he was not in holy orders\", ''algunas cron\u00f3nicas dizen que no era en sacres \u00f3rdenes'').{{sfn|Ubieto Arteta|1987|p=128\u201332}} At the [[Second Lateran Council]] in 1139, the church, perhaps influenced by the case of Ramiro and Agnes, declared the marriages of clerics to be null and void. Prior to this, they were legitimate, but illegal, marriages.{{sfn|Ubieto Arteta|1987|p=128\u201332}}\n\n==Queenship==\nThe first known royal diploma in which Agnes appears as queen is an original dated 29 January 1136.{{sfn|Reilly|1998|p=53}} By August Agnes had born a daughter, [[Petronilla of Aragon|Petronilla]]. Agnes' last appearance in an Aragonese document is from October 1136: a joint donation with her husband of a mill and a horse at Loscertales to the monastery of [[San Pedro de Antefruenzo]].{{sfn|Ubieto Arteta|1987|pp=137\u201338}} She and Ramiro may have separated shortly after this. Her brother died on a [[Way of Saint James|pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela]] on 3 April 1137. It was probably during his passage through Iberia that his consent to the proposed marriage of the infant Petronilla was obtained; there is no evidence that Agnes took any part in arranging the future of her daughter.{{sfn|Reilly|1998|p=61}}{{sfn|Ubieto Arteta|1987|pp=137\u201338}}\n\nIn a series of acts between 11 August and 13 November 1137, Ramiro betrothed his daughter to the powerful Count [[Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona]], made his subjects swear an oath of allegiance to the count and then handed over the royal power to him.{{sfn|Reilly|1998|p=61}} The transfer of power done, Ramiro returned to religious life and Agnes retired to the [[Abbey of Fontevraud]], where her mother had lived. She is recorded there between 1141 and 1147, and there she died around 1159.{{sfn|Fletcher|1984|p=272}}{{sfn|Ubieto Arteta|1987|pp=137\u201338}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last=Fletcher |first=Richard A. |authorlink=Richard A.
