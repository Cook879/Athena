But before I observe the formalities I offer a few small points that you are welcome to accept or reject, as you think best.\n\n*Lead\n**The hatnote mentions that HWB was American, but the text of the lead itself doesn't, and I think it should.\n*Early life\n**You give Thomas K Beecher his \"Reverend\" but in the lead you haven't done the same for Lynam Beecher (or HWB himself, for that matter). I'd be inclined to omit it for Thomas K, too, particularly as he has a WP article,\n**\"Mt. Pleasant Classical Institution\" \u2013 do the sources really say \"Mt\" rather than \"Mount\"? Looks rather odd.\n*Early ministry\n**\"had been hired as a minister\" \u2013 to an English eye it looks a bit odd to say \"hire\" a minister. I wonder if \"had been offered a post as a minister\" might read more naturally?\n**\"he also led a successful revival\" \u2013 of what, precisely?\n*Personal life\n**\"Beecher wed Eunice Bullard in 1837\" \u2013 perhaps this is one of those US-v-UK usage things, but to an English eye \"wed\" is used only in tabloid newspapers rather than by real people, who say \"married\".\n*Images\n**The picture of Beecher in what appears to be military uniform could do with a more detailed caption than just his name. I see the image is called [[:File:Henry Ward Beecher Chaplain.jpg]]. Was he a chaplain to the Unionist forces in the civil war? Perhaps even worth mentioning in the text, if so.\n***It seems that he was made the honorary chaplain of a New York national guard regiment in 1878 [http:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=gikuAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA138&lpg=PA138&dq=Henry+Ward+Beecher+Chaplain&source=bl&ots=V3ww59BaMk&sig=3Mn_NOiSNFqnpoEswRTA_2_ORQI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Dx23UeTEJIvM9ATEk4HoDQ&ved=0CFQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Chaplain&f=false]; my guess is that this was the year the photo was taken. I can't immediately find further detail on the photo, however. -- [[User:Khazar2|Khazar2]] ([[User talk:Khazar2|talk]]) 13:08, 11 June 2013 (UTC)\n\nThose few insignificant points are all I can find to quibble about. If you are thinking of taking the article on to FAC I think you need to get at least one more major biographical source: at present you rely very heavily on Applegate. Fine for GA, but FA reviewers will expect a wider range of sources.\n\nNow, to cut the ribbon:\n\n'''[[Wikipedia:Good article nominations|GA]] review \u2013 see [[WP:WIAGA]] for criteria'''\n{{#if:|<hr width=50%>|}}\n#Is it '''reasonably well written'''?\n#:A.

Beecher is one of those names one vaguely knows without quite knowing why. And now I do. Out of interest I looked out his obituary in our leading British paper, ''[[The Times]]'', which said of him, \"one of the ablest and most popular of United States citizens \u2013 a man in whom were embodied many of the virtues and some of the failings of the national character\", which chimes pretty well with your Applegate peroration at ref 64.

It was founded on 3 October 2009 in [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]]. The General Secretariat is in [[\u0130stanbul]], [[Turkey]]. The member countries are [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], and [[Turkey]]. The remaining two Turkic states, [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]] are not currently official members of the council due to their neutral stance; however, they are possible future members of the council.<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/turkkon.org\/docs\/02_a_NahcivanAnlasmasi_Turkce.pdf |title=Turk Dili Konusan Ulkeler Isbirligi Konseyi'nin Kurulmasina Dair Nahcivan Anlasmasi |publisher=Turkkon.org |accessdate=2014-03-05}}<\/ref> The idea of setting up this cooperative council was first put forward by Kazakh President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] back in 2006.\n\n==History==\nFor centuries, Turks shaped global history in their own particular way. They built and ruled numerous empires and states in the vast area stretching from Europe to India. Today Turkic States have entered a period of close cooperation, building stronger and sounder relations, and designing their common future together. The most important achievement of Turkic cooperation, as well as an indispensable prerequisite for its future development, is the establishment of the Cooperation Council of Turkic Speaking States or, simply, Turkic Council. Turkic Council is an [[intergovernmental organization]] whose overarching aim is promoting comprehensive cooperation among Turkic States. The organization was established on October 3, 2009 by the Nakhchivan Agreement signed among [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and Turkey. According to Halil Akinci, the founding Secretary-General of the organization \"Turkic Council has become the first voluntary alliance of Turkic states in history\".\n\n==Mission and objectives==\nThe Preamble of the Nakhchivan Agreement reaffirms the will of Member States to adhere to the purposes and principles enshrined in the [[Charter of the United Nations]], and defines the main objective of the Turkic Council as further deepening comprehensive cooperation among Turkic Speaking States, as well as making joint contributions to peace and stability in the region and in the world. Member States have confirmed their commitment to democratic values, human rights, the rule of law, and principles of good governance.\n\nThe Nakhchivan Agreement sets out the main purposes and tasks of the Organization as follows:\n*Strengthening mutual confidence and friendship among the Parties;\n*Developing common positions on foreign policy issues;\n*Coordinating actions to combat international terrorism, separatism, extremism and cross-border crimes;\n*Promoting effective regional and bilateral cooperation in all areas of common interest;\n*Creating favorable conditions for trade and investment;\n*Aiming for comprehensive and balanced economic growth, social and cultural development;\n*Expanding interaction in the fields of science, technology, education, health, culture, sports and tourism;\n*Encouraging interaction of mass media and other means of communication;\n*Promoting exchange of relevant legal information and enhancing legal cooperation.\n\n==Structure and operation==\nMain organs of the Turkic Council include:\n*Council of Heads of State\n*Council of Foreign Ministers\n*Senior Officials Committee\n*Council of Elders (Aksakals)\n*The Secretariat\nThe main decision-making and governing body of the Turkic Council is the Council of Heads of State, which is presided over by the President whose country holds the chairmanship. The chairmanship rotates on an annual basis. All activities of the Turkic Council are coordinated and monitored by its [[Secretariat (administrative office)|Secretariat]], which is located in Istanbul in accordance with the Nakchivan Agreement. Presidents meet once a year in a previously determined Turkic city. Senior officials, Aksakals, as well as other Ministers and government officials, all meet on a regular basis.\n\n==Projects==\nSince its founding agreement defines comprehensive cooperation among Turkic States as the organization\u2019s main objective and raison d'\u00eatre, the Turkic Council is working on a whole variety of projects. The projects are grouped under six cooperation processes, which are: economy, culture, education, transport, customs, and [[diaspora]]. Examples of the projects include establishing the Turkic University Association and writing a common history textbook. The Turkic Council also works on ways to boost economic development in underdeveloped regions of Member States. The Secretariat brings together Economy Ministers, Education Ministers, Transport Ministers, Heads of Customs Administrations, and other senior officials from different ministries and agencies in order to work on ways to promote cooperation in relevant spheres. Prior to being brought before ministers and heads of administrations, projects and issues of cooperation are elaborated by working groups. One recently launched project is the establishment of a mechanism for closer cooperation among Turkic diasporas all over the world.\n\n==Affiliated bodies and organizations==\n[[File:Map-TurkicLanguages.png|200px|right|thumb|The [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking areas]]\nThe Turkic Council functions as an umbrella organization for all other cooperation mechanisms like: \n*the Parliamentary Assembly of the Turkic Speaking Countries ([[TURKPA]]) ''(administrative capital, Baku)''\n*the [[International Organization of Turkic Culture]] ([[TURKSOY]]) ''(administrative capital, Ankara)''\n*International Turkic Academy ''(administrative capital, Astana)''\n*Turkic Cultural Heritage Fund \n*Center of Nomafic Civilizations ''(administrative capital, Bishkek)''\n*Turkic Business Council ''(administrative capital, \u0130stanbul)''\n\n==Summits==\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the newly independent Turkic States of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan as well as Turkey organized Summits of the Heads of Turkic Speaking States, the first of which took place in 1992 in Ankara. With the establishment of Turkic Council, at the 10th Summit it was decided to rename the top-level meetings to Turkic Council Summits.\n\nTurkic Council Summit is the highlight of the year whereby Heads of State evaluate outcomes of the past period and set goals for the next year. The First Summit took place in Almaty, Kazakhstan, on 20\u201321 October 2011 and focused primarily on economic cooperation. The Second Summit was held in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, on 22\u201323 August 2012 and concentrated on educational, scientific, and cultural cooperation. The Third Summit took place on 15\u201316 August 2013 in [[Qabala]], Azerbaijan with a theme of transport and connectivity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.turkkon.org\/eng\/icerik.php?no=159 |title=Third Summit of the Turkic Council Press Release|publisher=Turkkon.org|accessdate=2014-03-05}}<\/ref>\n\n==International cooperation==\nTurkic Council is an observer at the [[Economic Cooperation Organization]]. The Organization has also applied for an observer status at the United Nations and the [[Organization of Islamic Cooperation]]. Besides, Turkic Council maintains close cooperative relations with the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] and the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia.\n\n==Members==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and all government property (local, state and federal). Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes.

The editor suggested going to the sources the site used, but they weren't all accessible.

They can't be bothered to communicate with anyone.  \n\nThe review process is supposed to give noobs a chance to learn and fix, not slam the door in their face.\n\n\"Not notable\" - I call BS on that.  Just because they haven't ever heard of a person or site doesn't mean they aren't notable and don't have value.  To wipe out the work based on an opinion isn't helpful and doesn't promote cooperation, learning or community.  To the individual's credit, they tried to reinstate the previous version.\n\n\"It appears\" that the page violated copyright.  If you aren't going to take the time to really find out, don't just trash it!  I'm sure there were similarities, it can be pretty difficult not to be similar, but there were multiple references and much more information than the source they felt it violated.  Just because they don't want to take the time to really check it out, they just zap it all away.  If my understanding is correct, they can reject without blanking the entire thing.  \n\nHelp me out here, but it appears that Wikipedia is making it extremely difficult for new contributors to participate and become established.\n\nAggie80 17:10, 31 May 2013 (UTC)  <small><span class=\"autosigned\">\u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Aggie80|Aggie80]] ([[User talk:Aggie80|talk]] \u2022 [[Special:Contributions\/Aggie80|contribs]]) <\/span><\/small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\n\n: Hello and welcome to the Teahouse {{U|Aggie80}}!  I'm sure that no-one would argue with you that the article mainspace (where all articles go for everyone to read) is extremely hostile at first and it can seem like there is a barrier to prevent new editors from contributing... This actually couldn't be further from the truth!  New editors are welcome to contribute and to help them along there is a wonderful service called the [[WP:WIZARD|new article creation wizard]] to help you build your first articles!  What this process does is it places your draft idea for an article in a much less hostile environment to allow you to create it and develop it.  When you are done (citing lots of [[WP:reliable|reliable]] [[WP:independent|independent]] [[WP:sources|sources]] of course), there will be a button (or is it a link, I forget) that will allow you to submit your draft for review.  Due to the backlog, it may take up to a month for this review to take place (Wikipedia has [[WP:no deadlines|no deadlines]], so quality of articles is more import than quantity of articles and how fast they can be reviewed).  After the review, your draft will either be accepted and moved into the more hostile article space as something that won't likely be deleted soon, or it will more likely be declined (at least a couple times) with some comments and reasons why it wouldn't survive in that hostile article space.  Here is the good part, it won't immediately be deleted from there! So, you will have time to read the comments and suggestions for improvement and act upon them, maybe adding more reliable sources that prove notability or the ability to reword something that \"may\" be a copyright violation (note: if the entire article is a copy paste from another site, it will quickly be deleted even from this \"safer\" drafting place due to legal concerns, so try to put everything in your own words).\n: Now, as to the articles you have previously written that were deleted... Can you offer me redlinks to where the pages were located?  It is likely possible to have those articles undeleted and moved to the safer drafting place. [[User:Technical 13|Technical 13]] ([[User talk:Technical 13|talk]]) 17:40, 31 May 2013 (UTC)\n\n::''New editors are welcome to contribute and to help them along there is a wonderful service called the [[WP:WIZARD|new article creation wizard]] to help you build your first articles!''  ([[Bite]]y remark) Right! Which is exactly where all of my articles have started from, thank you very much.  And exactly where it was when I submitted it for review, after spending many days tweaking and working on it (and getting contributions from someone else!).  And exactly where it was deleted after submitting for review.  I did find one sentence that was pretty close to copied from one source, that was referenced right afterwards.  I managed to use my contributions tab to recreate the article (in the Wizard, again!) and clean that up. See [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation\/James Hill]]. When I first looked for him on Wikipedia, I found that someone had deleted the original page a long time ago as not being a notable person and worthy of inclusion.  While notability may not be apparent from the first drafts, and even inadvertent identical sentences may exist, to delete things so quickly and off highhandedly, indicates a mentality not willing to work with new comers. And to have this appear on their talk page ''If you want to ask me why I marked something for deletion, tagged your article as having an issue, or other basic editing related questions, go to the Wikipedia Teahouse.'' is clearly a slap in the face with more than a wet trout.  i.e., ''I'm too important to talk to you about such unimportant things.''

So a copyright picture of Brad Pitt is not FU since someone in Los Angeles could just snap their own photo of him tomorrow. However, a photo of a deceased person, the cover of a book, the logo of a company, those things may credibly only exist in copyrighted form and there is no way to acquire a public domain equivalent. In such limited cases, you can use a copyright image ''only for the exact subject covered'', it can only be used on that exact article, and it should be small and not of high resolution. For example, the logo for Starbucks has always been copyright, but if you upload it not to Commons but to Wikipedia itself, the image isn't a big high-res one, and this is the only Fair Use photo on the page [[Starbucks]] and not used on any other page, then you're kosher. Hope this helps for you or any others reading.

It is placed immediately after the name is used; at the end of the sentence only; or in both places?\nFor example: Klein[24] hypothesised that inhibition of return is a mechanism that allows a person not to re-search in previously searched visual fields as a result of \u201cinhibitory tags\u201d.[24]:1\nThanks,\n[[User:PilgrimB|PilgrimB]] ([[User talk:PilgrimB|talk]]) 05:47, 31 May 2013 (UTC)\n:Welcome to the Teahouse, PilgrimB. The exact position of the ref tag is an editorial decision, but as a general rule, it should be positioned at the end of a complete thought, or factual statement. So the second position would probably be best in your example. One specific requirement is that every quotation should be referenced to the source of the quote, right at the end of the quote, 100% of the time. If you are using a reference several times, the <nowiki><ref name=ABC><\/nowiki> alternative is useful, changing \"ABC\" to some useful mnemonic that calls that reference to your mind. To use the same reference a second or multiple times, just add <nowiki><ref name=ABC\/><\/nowiki> in each appropriate location.

The complexity of making the 'footnotes' actually linked to the 'references' is totally optional. Just just <nowiki><br \/><\/nowiki> to break the 'explanations' onto various lines. It can also help with 'phrasing', as you can cite a 'complete' quote in the footnotes without having to include it in the actual body copy (this can avoid 'issues' such as having to 'add' implied subject to the quote for clarity.

You may not like Sam but he is relevant and has changed the face of the  beauty industry and the way it was held together. His people started the natural curl \"Fierce hair\" craze and 1\/2 of the other crazes since he has been around. I have included it again and I am STILL asking for a mentor because I am frustrated.\n\n{{cot|we don't need the entire draft quoted here}}\nBlack Beauty Supply\n\nHistory:\n\nAnnie Malone developed and popularized the pressing comb in the early 1920\u2019s. She owned a Beauty School Chain called Poro College (Poro: a West African word meaning organization dedication and discipline) in Chicago, Indianapolis and St. Louis. She was the mentor and the inspiration for Madam C.J. Walker primarily known for her early 20th century hair treatments. The pair started the first Black Owned Beauty Supply Business. Black beauty supply stores started in black beauty and barber shops that were located in black communities across America in the early 20th century. Affluent blacks traveled to those community beauty salons and barber shops to have their hair done and bought products that were specifically made for their hair type by Black hair care manufacturers.\n\nGarret Morgan invented the first chemical hair relaxer in 1909 and named it the GA Morgan Hair Refining Cr\u00e8me. The cr\u00e8me allowed black hair to have a more European look and became an instant success. In 1929, Samuel B. Fuller started a line of hair care products which were sold door to door on the south side of Chicago. He quickly became one of the most prominent Black businessmen in the city. George E. Johnson was a production chemist for the S.B. Fuller Company and decided to strike on his own in the 1950\u2019s creating a men\u2019s product called Ultra Wave. In 1957, he started a professional salon line called for women called Ultra Sheen. Johnson products research laboratory became the largest laboratory devoted exclusively to black hair care products.\n\nBlack Hair care and cosmetics sales growth has proven to be stable and recession-resistant. A group of Korean immigrants in America discovered the market and began to start black beauty supply stores in areas that were predominantly African American.  The near monopoly of Korean owned black beauty supplies began to frustrate African American in the hair care and cosmetics trade merchants in the early 1990\u2019s.\n \nA 1993 study conducted by ViewPoint, Inc., a Chicago-based market research firm, revealed that many African-Americans were unaware and surprised that some of the hair care products they have been buying were not manufactured by African-American companies.  Seventy-nine percent of the African-American consumers said it is important that they purchase hair care products which are made by African-American manufacturers and 77 percent of these consumers said that if they knew which brand were African-American, they would show a preference for these brands in their future purchases.  The subject of Black Owned Beauty Supply Stores became a hot-button in the Black hair care industry as documented in the 2006 film entitled \u201cBlack Hair,\u201d by filmmaker Aron Ranen. \n\nSam Ennon created Black Owned Beauty Supply Association otherwise known as B.O.B.S.A. in 2004 as a non-profit in San Mateo, California. B.O.B.S.A is the leading trade association exclusively representing black-owned beauty supply stores and retail consumers in acquiring and owning black-owned beauty supply stores, beauty salons, nail salons and barbershops. The association was formed to  address the frustration  that many black community  members expressed worldwide over not being able to  buy and sell products in local black beauty supply stores in the 1990\u2019s to mid 2000.\n\nB.O.B.S.A\u2019s membership base includes over 5000 Black beauty professionals throughout the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Bermuda, Trinidad, West Indies and Switzerland 1500 beauty retail store operations in the USA, salons, barbershops, and training institutions. B.O.B.S.A  members have promoted economic growth by pooling resources and recycling millions of dollars back into the Black community through contributions to organizations such as the United Negro College Fund (UNCF), the NAACP,  the URBAN League, PUSH and the development of the Fred Luster, Sr. Scholarship Fund which provides thousands of dollars in scholarships to college-bound youths and cosmetology students across the country noting economic All of the association\u2019s programs are dedicated to promoting economic and educational growth. In addition, B.O.B.S.A companies employ thousands nationwide and B.O.B.S.A employers offer on the job training, educational workshop and business skill development. B.O.B.S.A companies spend $60 million annually in promotion on Black radio, magazines and newspapers, plus millions more from minority suppliers and related businesses. B.O.B.S.A produces Dots-Online Emagazine which is short for the term \u201cConnecting the Black Dots.\u201d Dots-Online Emagazine covers beauty industry news and events. B.O.B.S.A is a part of the Oakland Black Wall Street Districts comprised of churches, organizations, and businesses from 50th Avenue to 109th Avenue bound by International Boulevard in Oakland, California. \n\nLinks and references.\n\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Annie_Malone\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Madam_C._J._Walker\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Garrett_Morgan\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Samuel_B._Fuller\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/George_E._Johnson,_Sr.\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/CosmoProf\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bronner_Bros.\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/National_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Colored_People\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/National_Urban_League\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rainbow\/PUSH\nhttp:\/\/www.beautystorebusiness.com\/search\/node\/sam%20ennon\n\nAron Ranen http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm2578905\/\nDocumentary : http:\/\/blackhairdvd.com\/\n\nhttp:\/\/www.jazma.com\/black-hair-history\nViewPoint: http:\/\/www.chipublib.org\/cplbooksmovies\/cplarchive\/archivalcoll\/viewpoint.php#org\nhttp:\/\/www.ahbai.org\/scholar\/luster_cosmetology.html\n\nhttp:\/\/www.cosmoprofnorthamerica.com\n\nhttp:\/\/www.cosmoprofnorthamerica.com\/images\/speakers\/aab-2.pdf\nhttp:\/\/www.sfltimes.com\/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1157&Itemid=185\nwww.blackwallstreet.org\n\nwww.dots-online.com\n___________________________________________________________________________\nhttp:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Sam%2BEnnon.jpg\n[[File:Sam+Ennon.jpg|thumb|Sam Ennon]]\nhttp:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Bobsa%2BOrg%2BLogo%2Blg.png\n[[File:Bobsa+Org+Logo+lg.png|thumb|BOBSA LOGO]]\n\nBIO:\n\nSam Ennon is the president of the B.O.B.S.A, the nation\u2019s largest black-owned beauty supply trade association which was founded in 2004.

There is strong consensus that inhabited places are notable. Always look for the best reliable sources and use those as references. As for small companies, I think it is safe to say that most are considered \"run of the mill\" and may occasionally get routine, predictable news coverage in local media. But there are many small businesses that have a long and interesting history, or have pioneered a unique product, and may have attracted significant coverage in several independent, reliable sources well beyond a two paragraph write up about the new pizza parlor in town.

[[User:NorthBySouthBaranof|NorthBySouthBaranof]] ([[User talk:NorthBySouthBaranof|talk]]) 09:44, 1 June 2013 (UTC)\n\n== could use feedback before major edit ==\n\nI've been editing pages to do with rock music lately and as I keep linking to the article on the rock [[Power_trio]] it keeps bugging me in its current form. To begin with seeing The Police as the first picture on power trios doesn't seem right. And the whole article as is right now is pretty much original research. Lots of bands I've never heard of are mentioned and some of the things said are debatable at best (and all with essentially no references).  I've been trying to find a good reference for the topic but so far have really been coming up empty both with books and online resources (if someone has suggestions please let me know). I've looked at Allmusic which is a good source for basic info on Rock but they don't seem to have an article on Power Trios, just on specific bands that are such trios. I have a revised version where I've cut out about 70% of the text and left only what I thought was incontrovertable, that no one familiar with blues rock would disagree with and keeping the one good reference the article had. The revised version is in my sandbox:  http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Mdebellis\/sandbox   (I think everyone can see that if not and you do want to take a look let me know) I'm nervous though that if I do the edit I'm going to  remove someone's favorite band and might generate some controversy.  Looking for some feedback, thanks in advance.  [[User:Mdebellis|Mdebellis]] ([[User talk:Mdebellis|talk]]) 19:38, 31 May 2013 (UTC)\n\n:I don't know much about the subject.

[[User:Pug6666|Pug6666]] 20:52, 31 May 2013 (UTC)\n\n::I'm still pretty new myself, and mostly make minor article tweaks & revert vandals, but to me this is the problem with poorly sourced articles, so much of it is arbitrary based on opinion. Ironically, your porposal got rid of the overview which attempted to narrow the scope of the term, but you also trimmed back the examples big time. The current article, though it tries to pin down a tighter definition, then includes '90 bands which don't really fit, like two of my faves, [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]] & [[Everclear (band)|Everclear]]. So, despite your interest & solid effort, I could be inclined to like the current rev. based on [[WP:ILIKEIT]], which is by defnintion a poor rationale. [[User:Boogerpatrol|Boogerpatrol]] ([[User talk:Boogerpatrol|talk]]) 21:13, 31 May 2013 (UTC)\n:::Thanks for the feedback. You convinced me I need to do a bit more research and have at least one more reference before I go live. If you are interested in the topic please watch the [[Power_trio]] page.

I'm not going to get involved in it (I'm busy lol) but I remember having looked at this exact article in the past and having the same 'general' impression as the OP about the article as a whole (lack of 'sources' for the somehat randomly included bands, as if people had just added their favorites over the years.)

Fughgettaboutit's links were amazingly helpful. I'm a new editor and didn't even know about an alltext search. After looking at what he sent me I did some more searching on my own.  As just an aside this is what I love about Wikipedia, the way you learn by doing.   The one issue I was still debating was whether to include something about The Police. IMO it makes no sense to call them a Power Trio (this is me as a person not an editor). But as I searched The Police came up more than once in articles with the keywords including one by Dick Clark who I think is pretty lame but I have to admit he has credibility as someone people listen to on Rock. So I'm going to include a sentence and a reference that documents the fact that the term is used for a lot of different bands and mention The Police.

Images need to have an [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags|image tag]] applied to the [[Wikipedia:Image description page|image description page]] indicating the copyright status of the image. This uniform and easy-to-understand method of indicating the license status allows potential re-users of the images to know what they are allowed to do with the images.\n\nFor more information on using images, see the following pages:\n* [[Wikipedia:Image use policy]]\n* [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags]]\n\nThis is an automated notice by [[User:OrphanBot|OrphanBot]].

Holden made national headlines with his walk.\n\n==Biography==\nBill Holden grew up at the beginning of the [[television]] era in the [[United States]]. His father was a die-hard [[baseball]] fan. In 1957, Holden had his first in-person baseball experience, going to a [[Chicago Cubs]] home game. Holden became a lifetime Cubs fan instantly. \n\n[[Ron Santo]] became Holden's favorite player.  \n\nHolden has followed the Cubs his whole life since seeing them play in person for the first time. He chose to become a teacher instead of a baseball player, however, and, in 1966, he enrolled at [[Southern Illinois University]], graduating in 1970. \n\nHolden got his first job as a teacher in 1973. He has been working as a teacher since. He became interested in teaching [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] children, so, after many years teaching in the [[Illinois]] public schools system, he relocated to [[Camp Verde, Arizona]]. At Camp Verde, he became aware of the alarming incidence of diabetes among Indian children. He started teaching groups of children that suffered from the disease. \n\nOn New Year's Eve 2004, his son presented him with the [[Documentary film|docu-film]] ''[[This Old Cub]]'', based on Santo's experience as a diabetic player in  MLB. After watching the film seven times before going to bed that morning, Holden became inspired and convinced that he needed to do something to help find a cure for diabetes.\n\n== The walk ==\nOn January 11, 2005, Holden began his walk, hoping to cover at least 12 miles each day. Holden crossed over six states, including [[New Mexico]], [[Texas]], [[Oklahoma]] and [[Missouri]], apart from Arizona and Illinois. Among the things he had to battle along the way were wearyness and the summer heat. According to his own account, Holden had a brush with death when he was about to get run over by a car, but the drivers recognized him and waved. \n\nHolden had told Santo about the fund raising walk before it took place, gaining Santo's admiration. \n\nOn June 29, Holden arrived at ''[[Harry Caray]]'s restaurant'' in [[Rosemont, Illinois]]. He overnighted there, as he had previously done in several odd places and small hotels. \n\nAfter arriving at the famous Cubs baseball stadium, [[Wrigley Field]], on July 1, Holden, who was joined by Illinois Governor [[Rod Blagojevich]] during the final steps of his walk, threw that day's symbolic first pitch to [[Kerry Wood]], as the Cubs played the [[Washington Nationals]]. During the game's seventh inning stretch, he and Santo sang the ''Take me Out to the Ballgame'' baseball hymn. \n\nBill Holden has [[arthritis]] in both of his knees.

Soon she felt called and approached Fr. Angelo Bosio, her spiritual teacher for help. The approval of the [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Bishop]] of [[Brescia]], Gabrio Nava allowed Fr. Angelo Bosio and the parish priest, Father Rusticiano Barboglio to buy a house. This came to be known as the \u201cConventino\u201d (small convent) from where the congregation's work began.<ref name=Mosca\/>\n\n[[File:Saint Vincenza Gerosa.jpg|thumb|160px|Saint [[Vincenza Gerosa]]]]\nAbout the same time [[Vincenza Gerosa|Catherine Gerosa]] who had lost her family in rapid succession was left alone to manage the family business. She used her family\u2019s money to provide charitable works in the community. Catherine became involved in her Church parish, organizing a women\u2019s oratory with meetings and retreats, and founding a practical school to teach the poor girls of the community domestic work so as to improve their station in life. In one of these meetings, Catherine encountered [[Bartolomea Capitanio]], and together they embarked on a new mission to start a hospital to care for those who could not afford medical care.\n\nAfter having accomplished this they decided to extend their mission to establish a special religious institute with the objectives of providing assistance to the sick, free education for girls, Christian orphanages, and programs designed to promote youth welfare. To accomplish this mission, together they founded the Sisters of Charity in 1824.<ref>[http:\/\/365rosaries.blogspot.in\/2011\/06\/june-28-saint-vincenza-gerosa.html \"Saint Vincenza Gerosa\", 365 Rosaries]<\/ref>\n\n==Maria Bambina==\nThe wax image of ''Maria Bambina'' was modeled in 1735 by Sr. Isabella Chiara Formari, a Sister of the Poor Clares in Todi, Perugia.

Over the main entrance of the Milan cathedral are the words in bronze letters: ''Mariae Nascenti'', meaning to the Infant Mary.<ref name=Jairam>[http:\/\/campus.udayton.edu\/mary\/questions\/yq\/yq133.html Jairam, Rayma. \"Information on the 'Divina Infantita' (since Vatican II called the little Immaculate Mary) or in Italy called 'Maria Bambina'\", The Marian Library, University of Dayton]<\/ref>\n\nBishop Alberico Simonetta brought the waxen image of Maria Bambina to Milan on his return to his native town in 1738. In 1739 the image was entrusted to the Capuchin Sisters. In 1842 the image of the Infant Mary was donated to the sanctuario attached to the Sisters of Charity Generalate in Milan by the Franciscan Sisters of Todi. The image of the Maria Bambina was exposed for veneration only on the 8th of September, the Feast of Mary's Nativity. The Milanese began to call the sisters who staffed the Hospital of Ciceri the \u201cSisters of Maria Bambina\u201d.\n\nBeginning in 1884, various miracles were attributed to the image. It became the custom to offer newly married couples a wedding gift of a small wax image of Maria Bambina. The devotion to Maria Bambina spread from the Milan area to the whole of Italy.<ref name=Jairam\/>\n\n==Expansion==\nIn Italy, where the Institute began in 1832, most of the communities founded were first in the Lombardo-Veneto region.\nThe Community went to India in March 1860, where there developed 197 houses in eight provinces. In 1864 the sisters in India extended their work into what is now Bangladesh, where there are 18 communities.

Do you honestly believe that because Craig said he doesn't plan to do his third Bond movie right away that there won't be one? Let me remind you the man is signed for four more flicks. xXx 3 is confirmed, a script is being written, director and star are signed and there is a release date and start of filming date, what more do you need? Same for Ghostbusters 3, script is written, actors are confirmed, being signed. Transformers 3 isn't officially official, but the producers, director and screenwriters keep talking about it as though it was, a third movie is planned. Batman 3 WILL happen, it is confirmed, do you honestly think Warner Bros will not continue the franchise after the success it has had? Riddick already is a trilogy (Pitch Black & Dark Fury & CoR), parts 4 & 5 are being written. As for Spider-Man it may just be tv episodes strung together as movies, but other such things are listed so it has a place. Finally of course series with no wikilinks should be listed, so that people can create the damn articles.

I think it's pretty safe to say that when a movie is in production with a script, director, actors, studio briefings, release date, etc, etc, it's pretty safe to assume it's going to be released. Sure anything can happen, but at this point Bond 23 is official, Iron Man 3 is official, Batman 3 is official, etc... just because the films haven't been released does not mean they do not have their place, Wikipedia does list \"future films\", there is a special template for that even. And if you make changes to a list such as this, please at least move the films to the \"appropriate\" section instead of simply deleting.

You remind of why I'd become disgusted with editing Wikipedia a little less then a year ago when I kept adding Indiana Jones under tetralogy and people like you kept deleting it... Who are you to decide above the original filmmakers and film companies just how many movies are comprised in a franchise? You talk of films \"not created\" until they \"begin production\", then how do you account for you deleting my adds of Scooby-Doo, Batman 2005 and Riddick in the \"trilogies\" section? How do you account for deleting Fast & Furious from the tetralogy section? (I've since added it again, don't you dare delete it). How dare you say such films as Big Momma's House 3, Ghostbusters 3, xXx 3 are \"wishful thinking\" and that there is no official status to them when scripts are written, auditions are underway and filming is gearing up? Vanilla Sky 2 is wishful thinking, Iron Man 2 is not. Please try to understand that it's not up to you to decide what movies exist, it's up to the people who make them.

The black cloud represents the general distribution of ash and cinder. Modern coast lines are shown.]]'''Stabiae''' was an ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] town, located close to the modern town of [[Castellammare di Stabia]] approximately 4.5&nbsp;km southwest of [[Pompeii]]. It was positioned on a 50&nbsp;m high headland overlooking the [[Gulf of Naples]].<ref>\n[http:\/\/www.sdmart.org\/exhibition-stabiano.html San Diego Museum of Art exhibition on Stabiae]\n<\/ref><ref name=\"restoring\">[http:\/\/stabiae.org\/usa\/index2.html Restoring Stabiae website]\n<\/ref> Being only {{convert|16|km|mi}} from [[Mount Vesuvius]], this [[seaside resort]] was largely destroyed by two metres of [[tephra]] ash in 79 AD.\n\nOriginally a small [[port]], by the 6th century BC Stabiae had already been overshadowed by the much larger port at [[Pompeii]]. The town was destroyed by [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] on 30 April 89&nbsp;BC during the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)|Social War]], a [[revolt]] by many of Rome's allies in the area. The Roman [[author]] and [[admiral]] [[Pliny the Elder]] recorded that the town was rebuilt and became a popular resort for wealthy Romans. He reported that there were several miles of luxury villas built along the edge of the headland, all enjoying panoramic views out over the bay.<ref name=\"restoring\"\/>\n\nAccording to the account<ref>\n[http:\/\/www.classics.cam.ac.uk\/Pompeii\/Destruction.html Account of Pliny's death] (the famous letter by Pliny's nephew, Pliny the Younger, in Latin and English)\n<\/ref> written by [[Pliny the Younger|his nephew]], Pliny the Elder was at the other side of the bay in [[Misenum]] when the eruption started. He travelled by [[galley]] ship across the bay, partly to observe the eruption more closely, and partly to rescue people from the coast near the volcano.\n\nPliny died at Stabiae the following day, probably during the arrival of the sixth and largest [[pyroclastic surge]] of the eruption caused by the collapse of the [[eruption plume]].<ref>\n{{cite book  | title=Volcanoes| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=2004  | author=Francis, Peter & Oppenheimer, Clive| isbn=0-19-925469-9}}\n<\/ref> The very diluted outer edge of this surge reached Stabiae and left two centimetres of fine ash on top of the immensely thick aerially-deposited tephra which further protected the underlying remains.\n\n== Archaeological ruins ==\n[[File:Primavera di Stabiae.jpg|300px|left|thumb|Primavera di Stabiae]]\n\n===History===\n[[File:S03 06 01 001 image 382.jpg|thumbnail|1895. View from Baths of Stabiae. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]\nThe archaeological remains of Stabiae were originally discovered in 1749 by Cavaliere Rocco de Alcubierre, an engineer working for king  [[Charles III of Spain|Charles VII of Naples]].<ref name=\"Parslow\">\n{{cite book | title=Rediscovering Antiquity: Karl Weber and the Excavation of Herculaneum, Pompeii, and Stabiae | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1995 | author= Parslow, Christopher Charles | isbn= 0-521-47150-8}}\n<\/ref>  These ruins were partially excavated by Alcubierre with help from [[Karl Weber (archaeologist)|Karl Weber]] between 1749\u20131782.<ref name=\"Parslow\"\/> The ruins that had been excavated, however, were reburied and their location was forgotten until 1950, when a high school principal rediscovered them.<ref name=\"restoring\"\/>  The site was declared an archaeological protected area in 1957, and by 1962 many of the ruins had been again uncovered. The remains of both an [[Oscan]] settlement (oppidum) and the later Roman town were discovered.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\">[http:\/\/search.eb.com.turing.library.northwestern.edu\/eb\/article-9069333 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Website]\n<\/ref>\n\nThe most famous of the findings at Stabiae are the villas that come from the time between the destruction of Stabiae by Sulla in 89&nbsp;BC and the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79&nbsp;AD.<ref name=\"Senatore\">\n{{cite book | title=Stabiae: Dalla preistoria alla guerra greco-gotica | publisher=Edizioni Spano | year=2003 | author= Felice Senatore | isbn=88-88226-15-X}}\n<\/ref>  As described above, Stabiae became a resort town during this time and was particularly favored for its view of the Bay of Naples and the surrounding mountains.<ref name=\"restoring\"\/> Stabiae was also well known for the quality of its spring water, which was believed to have medicinal properties.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\"\/>  The ideal placement and qualities of this location drew  many wealthy Romans to build luxurious villas on the ridge overlooking the bay.  These villas, which are described below, provide us with some of the most stunning architectural and artistic remains from Roman villas. 2004 saw an Italian-American collaboration between the Superintendency of Archaeology of Pompeii, the region of Campania and the University of Maryland to form the non-profit Archaeological entity, the Restoring Ancient Stabiae Foundation (RAS). It is the RAS Foundation's prime goal to excavate, restore and build an archaeological park at the ancient site of Stabiae, a complex of seven or eight Roman villas according to recent geophysical surveys conducted by the University of Birmingham.\n\nA great many [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] which come from Stabiae are preserved in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]].\n\n===Pre-Roman settlement===\n\nBefore the age of the villas, however, an [[Oscan]] settlement existed in the region of Stabiae.  In 1957 three hundred tombs dating from the 7th to the 3rd centuries BC were found in a [[necropolis]] associated with this town.  Many pieces of pottery were found in these tombs and provide us with archaeological evidence that supports the dating of the Oscan inhabitants.<ref name=\"Senatore\" \/>  It appears that the [[Samnites]] later took over the Oscan town in the 5th century.<ref>\n[http:\/\/search.eb.com.turing.library.northwestern.edu\/eb\/article-5859 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Website]\n<\/ref>\n\n===Villas===\n[[File:Villa San Marco - Atrio.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Villa San Marco]]\nAmong the many villas found at Stabiae, the most famous are Villa San Marco, Villa Del Pastore, and Villa Arianna. Some of the other villas include Villa Carmiano, Villa del Petraro, and Villa Capella di San Marco.\n\n====Villa San Marco====\nThis villa, deriving the name from a chapel that existed in its proximity in the 18th century, was the first one to be explored in the course of excavations in [[Charles III of Spain|Bourbon]] times carried out between 1749 and 1754.  The graphic and textual documentation of the Bourbon surveys was published in 1881 by M. Ruggiero M. in the book ''Degli Scavi di Stabiae dal 1749 al 1782'' (\"On the Stabiae excavations from 1749 to 1782\"). The villa was re-buried after the removal of its furnishings and of the better preserved frescoes. Excavations were resumed on 1950 by Libero d\u2019Orsi and O. Elia of the Archaeological Superintendency.\n\nOne of the largest villas ever discovered in [[Campania]], measuring more than 11,000 square metres,<ref name=\"restoring\" \/> it has an [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]], a courtyard containing a98> pool, a [[triclinium]] with views of the bay, and a colonnaded courtyard.  There are also many other small rooms, a kitchen and two internal gardens.  Villa San Marco also has a private bath complex that is made up of a [[calidarium]], [[tepidarium]], and a [[frigidarium]].  This villa is also important because it has provided  frescoes, sculptures, mosaics and architecture, which show styles and themes comparable to those found in Pompeii and Herculaneum.\n\n====Villa del Pastore====\n[[File:Villa del Pastore Pastore.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Shepherd from the Villa del Pastore]]\n\"Villa of the Shepherd\" in English.  This villa gets its name from a small statue of a shepherd that was discovered at this site.  This villa measures even larger than Villa San Marco, coming in at 19,000 square metres.  The villa was rediscovered in 1967 and includes many rooms, large baths and luxurious gardens.  It lacks, however, any domestic rooms, suggesting that it may not have been a residence. One hypothesis is that this is instead a [[valetudinarium]] (health spa) that would have allowed people to take advantage of the famous spring waters of Stabiae. It has not yet been fully excavated.\n\n====Villa Arianna====\n[[File:Stanza del mito di Arianna.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Villa Arianna]]\nNamed for the fresco depicting [[Dionysus]] saving [[Ariadne]] from the island of Dia (a mythological name for Naxos), this villa is particularly famous for its frescoes, many of which depict light, winged figures.<ref name= \"restoring\" \/>  It is difficult to get a clear sense of this villa, however, because it grew over the course of 150 years.  It has one of the largest courtyards of any Roman villa; measuring two stadia in length.  Another feature of Villa Arianna is its private tunnel system that links the villa in its location on the ridge to the sea shore, which was probably only between 100 and 200 metres away from the bottom of the hill in Roman times.  The shoreline has since changed, leaving the archaeological site further inland than it was in antiquity.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Herculaneum]]\n*[[Pliny the Elder]]\n*[[Pliny the Younger]]\n*[[Pompeii]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons}}\n* [http:\/\/www.stabiae.org\/foundation\/ Restoring Ancient Stabiae Foundation site]\n* [https:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/ad79eruption\/stabiae  Stabiae - Comprehensive site on the eruption of 79&nbsp;AD]\n* [http:\/\/www.auav46.dsl.pipex.com\/p125.htm Herculaneum\/Pompeii\/Stabiae Website]\n* [http:\/\/www.webvisionitaly.com\/category.php?id=77 Video Villa San Marco]\n* [http:\/\/creadm.solent.ac.uk\/custom\/rwpainting\/cover\/index.html Romano-Campanian Wall-Painting]\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2011}}\n{{Archaeological sites in Campania}}\n{{Archaeological site of Pompeii}}\n{{Landmarks of Campania}}\n\n[[Category:Roman towns and cities in Italy]]\n[[Category:Visitor attractions in Campania]]\n[[Category:Populated coastal places in Italy]]\n[[Category:Destroyed cities]]\n[[Category:Former populated places in Italy]]\n[[Category:Pompeii (ancient city)]]\n[[Category:Roman sites of Campania]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in the 1st millennium BC]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in Campania]]\n[[Category:Castellammare di Stabia]]","timestamp":"20160410100953","user-timestamp":"20150410100953"},{"title":"Wikipedia:No firm rules","content":"{{warning|This is a '''workshop''' page, and not the actual policy page of Wikipedia's Ignore All Rules.

If you do what seems sensible, it will usually be right, and if it's not right, don't worry. Even the worst mistakes are easy to correct: older versions of a page remain in the [[Help:page_history|revision history]] and can be restored. If we disagree with your changes, we'll talk about it thoughtfully and politely, and we'll figure out what to do. So don't worry. [[Wikipedia:Be Bold|Be bold]], and enjoy helping to build this free encyclopedia.\n\n*You are not required to learn the rules before contributing. Yes, we already said that, but it is  worth repeating.\n*Don't follow written instructions mindlessly, but rather, consider how the encyclopedia is improved or damaged by each edit. (See also [[Wikipedia:Use common sense]].)\n*Rules derive their power to compel not from being written down on a page labelled \"guideline\" or \"policy\", but from being a reflection of the shared opinions and practices of a great many editors. (See also [[Wikipedia:Consensus]].)\n*Most rules are ultimately ''descriptive'', not ''prescriptive''; they describe existing current practice. They sometimes lag behind the practices they describe. (See also [[Wikipedia:Product, process, policy]].)\n*[[Wikipedia:WikiLawyering|WikiLawyering]] doesn't work.  Loopholes and technicalities do not exist on the Wiki.  Wikipedia is [[WP:BURO|not a bureaucracy]]; not [[moot court]], nor [[nomic]], nor [[Mao (game)|Mao]].\n*The spirit of the rule trumps the letter of the rule.  The common purpose of building a free encyclopedia trumps both.  If this common purpose is better served by ignoring the letter of a particular rule, then that rule should perhaps be ignored.\n*Following the rules is less important than using good judgment and being thoughtful and considerate, always bearing in mind that good judgment is not displayed only by those who agree with you. (See also [[Wikipedia:Civility]].)\n\n==What \"Ignore all rules\" does not mean==\nDespite its name, \"[[Wikipedia:Ignore all rules|Ignore all rules]]\" does not sabotage the other rules. Its purpose is to keep them from sabotaging what we're doing here: building a free encyclopedia. Rules have ''zero'' importance compared with that goal. If they aid that goal, good. If they interfere with it, they are instantly negated.\n\n*\"Ignore all rules\" does not mean that every action is justifiable.  It is neither a [[Trump (card game)|trump card]] nor a [[wiktionary:carte blanche|carte blanche]]. A rule-ignorer must justify how their actions improve the encyclopedia if challenged. Actually, everyone should be able to do that at all times. In cases of conflict, what counts as an improvement is decided by consensus.\n*\"Ignore all rules\" does not stop you from pointing out a rule to someone who has broken it, but do consider that their judgment may have been correct. (See also [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith]].)\n*\"Ignore all rules\" is not an answer if someone asks you why you broke a rule.  Most of the rules are derived from a lot of thoughtful experience and exist for pretty good reasons; they should therefore only be broken for good reasons.\n*\"Ignore all rules\" is not an exemption from accountability. You're still responsible for reasonably foreseeable effects of your actions on the encyclopedia and on other editors.\n*\"Ignore all rules\" is not an invitation to use Wikipedia for purposes contrary to that of building a free encyclopedia. (See also [[Wikipedia:About]] and [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not]].)\n*\"Ignore all rules\" does not mean there is necessarily an exception to every rule. Blatant [[WP:COPYVIO|copyright violations]], for instance, do not make for a better free encyclopedia (although [[WP:FAIRUSE|limited uses]] of copyrighted material are acceptable).\n\n== See also ==\n{| class=\"infobox sisterproject noprint plainlinks\" style=\"width: auto;\"\n|-\n| [[File:Sound-icon 30px.png|30x23px|link=Wikipedia:Spoken articles]]\n|'''Listen to this policy''' ([[:Image:Ignore_all_rules.ogg|info \/ help]])<br\/>[[:Media:Ignore_all_rules.ogg|in media player]] {{\u00b7}} [http:\/\/tools.wikimedia.de\/~gmaxwell\/jorbis\/JOrbisPlayer.php?path={{urlencode:Ignore_all_rules.ogg}}&wiki=en in browser]'''\n|}\n*[[Wikipedia:Understanding IAR|Wikipedia:Understanding ''Ignore all rules'']]\n* [[Wikipedia:Do not disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point]]\n{{-}}\n{{Wikipedia principles}} \n\n<!-- retrieved from [[Wikipedia:Ignore all rules\/Workshop]] -->","timestamp":"20160410100953","user-timestamp":"20150410100953"},{"title":"User talk:99.241.160.148","content":"== July 2008 ==\n\n[[Image:Information.png|25px]] Welcome to Wikipedia.

The band made a name for itself in nearby [[Washington, D.C.]], playing the WHFS annual rock show [[HFStival]] in 1998 and 1999.<ref>{{cite web |author=MacKenzie Wilson |url=http:\/\/allmusic.com\/artist\/good-charlotte-p442724\/biography |title=Good Charlotte |publisher=AllMusic |date=October 27, 2000 |accessdate=November 8, 2011 |archiveurl=https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20120427154704\/http:\/\/www.allmusic.com\/artist\/good-charlotte-p442724\/biography |archivedate=2012-04-27 |deadurl=no}}<\/ref> The band mainly played out small bars which soon earned the group attention.\n\n=== ''Good Charlotte'' (1999\u20132001) ===\nGood Charlotte's debut studio album ''[[Good Charlotte (album)|Good Charlotte]]'' was released in 2000 and was the start of the band's music career. The album contains three singles: \"Little Things\", \"Motivation Proclamation\", and \"Festival Song\". [[Aaron Escolopio]] was the band's drummer for this album, but left the band before ''[[The Young and the Hopeless]]'' to join his brother's band [[Wakefield (band)|Wakefield]], and was replaced by Nate Foutz (drummer of the band [[Vroom (band)|Vroom]]).\n\n=== ''The Young and the Hopeless'' (2002\u20132003) ===\n2002's ''[[The Young and the Hopeless]]'' sold 4.9 million copies and thrust the band into mainstream popularity. The band's breakthrough single, titled \"[[Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous (Good Charlotte song)|Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous]]\", topped both pop and rock charts around the globe. Singles that were released from the album include \"[[The Anthem (Good Charlotte song)|The Anthem]]\", \"[[Girls & Boys (Good Charlotte song)|Girls & Boys]]\", \"[[The Young & the Hopeless|The Young and the Hopeless]]\", and \"[[Hold On (Good Charlotte song)|Hold On]]\". The band cited [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], [[Social Distortion]], and [[The Clash]] as influences for the album.\n\nThe album eventually went on to receive triple platinum certification (three million copies sold) from the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http:\/\/www.riaa.com\/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |title=RIAA Certification Database |publisher=Riaa.com |accessdate=August 19, 2011 |archiveurl=<!-- can't be crawled -->}}<\/ref> During the course of the album's success, Good Charlotte landed appearances on ''[[American Idol]]'', CNN, and ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'', the covers of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[Alternative Press]]'' magazines, and were also featured in ''[[The New York Times]]''. The band also became popular on MTV, where the band's music videos were played in heavy rotation on both MTV and [[MTV2]]. \"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous\" received the \"Viewers Choice Award\" at the [[2003 MTV Video Music Awards#Viewer's Choice|2003 MTV Video Music Awards]].\n\nAfter a few months of touring, Nate Foutz (Vroom Drummer) returned to join his band for the band's summer tour.  The band hired drummers during the recording, release and touring of ''The Young and the Hopeless'' due to former drummer [[Aaron Escolopio]] having left the band before its release. In 2003, the band added Chris Wilson as a drummer; he was introduced to the band through mutual friends from the group [[The Used]].\n\n=== ''The Chronicles of Life and Death'' (2004\u20132007) ===\nGood Charlotte's third album, ''[[The Chronicles of Life and Death]]'', was released by Epic Records in 2004. The album received mixed reactions from both the music press and Good Charlotte's fan base. The album sold 2.2 million copies. The album has been widely considered a departure from the band's previous two albums, mixing new elements such as lyrical topics into Good Charlotte's youthful sound. Singles released from the album include the two hits \"[[Predictable (Good Charlotte song)|Predictable]]\" and \"[[I Just Wanna Live]]\", as well as \"[[The Chronicles of Life and Death (song)|The Chronicles of Life and Death]]\" and \"[[We Believe]]\". The only single from ''The Chronicles of Life and Death'' which managed to chart on the U.S. Hot 100 was the hit \"I Just Wanna Live\". All of the singles released from the album went top 30 in the UK, except for \"We Believe\". The band would then go on tour with [[Sum 41]].\n\nIn May 2005, after much speculation from fans, it was officially confirmed that Chris Wilson had left the band citing personal health reasons. Benji also told ''[[Kerrang!]]'' magazine that, for him, \"Chris leaving the band was the worst part of 2005.\" Chris then joined the pop\/punk band [[The Summer Obsession]] until 2011. He currently plays drums for [[JMSN]].\n\nOn Good Charlotte's \"Noise to the World\" Tour, performing with [[Simple Plan]] and [[Relient K]], the band recruited [[Dean Butterworth]] (who had previously played for [[Morrissey]]) as the band's temporary drummer. Later, in March 2007, Butterworth was confirmed as the band's permanent drummer.\n\n[[Benji Madden]] has claimed in interviews that he feels this record was not as successful as the previous record due to it being \"too selfish.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Boys Like Girls, Good Charlotte deliver insincere sets |url=http:\/\/www.azcentral.com\/thingstodo\/music\/articles\/2008\/07\/22\/20080722boyslikegirlsreview.html?nclick_check=1 |work=azcentral.com |accessdate=December 21, 2013 |author=Maria Verso |date=July 22, 2008 |quote=From the moment Good Charlotte took the stage with The Anthem \u2013 \"It's a new day but it all feels old.\" You remember, right? \u2013 you realized that Good Charlotte is the Soundtrack of Your Summer if that summer happened to be 2002.

Shadows]] and guitarist [[Synyster Gates]], appeared online on January 4, 2007, and was released as the first single from the album in North America.

The second single released in North America was \"[[Dance Floor Anthem (I Don't Want to Be in Love)|Dance Floor Anthem]]\", with which the band had scored a surprise hit, making it onto 11 different Billboard charts and peaking at No.&nbsp;2 in Australia.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} The \"Keep Your Hands Off My Girl\" video was certified gold by [[MTV International]] in December 2007.

He then moved to New York City, where he was a composition student of [[Elliott Carter]] at [[The Juilliard School]].  Discouraged by his progress and fascinated by the cultural and social upheavals going on in New York at the time, he discontinued his composition studies, eventually enrolling at [[Hunter College]] as a composition major, where he earned a degree and made several short films.\n\nHe had a promising career as a filmmaker, but died in [[New York City]] from [[AIDS]] complications, without having fulfilled his potential. He is best known for his 1986 film ''[[Parting Glances]]'', made for $310,000, a bittersweet romantic comedy that spans a 24-hour period in the upwardly-mobile New York [[gay scene]].  He wrote  half a dozen screenplays and completed three short films in the six years before ''Parting Glances'', and wrote two-and-a-half more screenplays in the four years after.

Her parents were members of the Lithuanian [[intelligentsia]].<ref name=\"WareBraukman234\">{{Harvnb|Ware|Braukman|2004|p=234}}.<\/ref> Her mother received a [[doctorate]] in [[ophthalmology]] at the [[University of Berlin]] in 1908 and became the first female physician in Lithuania, while her father received his [[Doctor of Medicine|medical degree]] from the [[University of Tartu]] in 1910. After the 1917 [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], Gimbutas' parents founded the first Lithuanian hospital in the capital.<ref name=\"WareBraukman234\"\/> During this period, her father also served as the publisher of the newspaper ''Vilniaus \u017dodis'' and the cultural magazine ''Vilniaus \u0160viesa'' and was an outspoken proponent of Lithuanian independence during the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian War|war against Poland]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Marler|1998|p=114}}.<\/ref> Gimbutas' parents were [[connoisseur]]s of traditional Lithuanian folk arts and frequently invited contemporary musicians, writers, and authors to their home, including [[Vyd\u016bnas]], [[Juozas Tumas-Vai\u017egantas]], and [[Jonas Basanavi\u010dius]].<ref name=\"Marler115\">{{Harvnb|Marler|1998|p=115}}.<\/ref> With regard to her strong cultural upbringing, Gimbutas said:\n<blockquote>\nI had the opportunity to get acquainted with writers and artists such as [[Vyd\u016bnas|Vydunas]], [[Juozas Tumas-Vai\u017egantas|Vai\u017egantas]], even [[Jonas Basanavi\u010dius|Basanavi\u010dius]], who was taken care of by my parents.

And later, throughout my entire life, Basanavi\u010dius's collected folklore remained extraordinarily important for me.<ref name=\"Marler115\"\/>\n<\/blockquote>\n\nIn 1931, Gimbutas settled with her parents in [[Kaunas]], the [[temporary capital of Lithuania]], where she continued her studies. After her parents separated that year, she lived with her mother and brother, Vytautas, in Kaunas. Five years later, her father died suddenly. At her father's deathbed, Gimbutas pledged that she would study to become a scholar: \"All of a sudden I had to think what I shall be, what I shall do with my life. I had been so reckless in sports\u2014swimming for miles, skating, bicycle riding. I changed completely and began to read.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Marler|1998|p=116}}.<\/ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Marler|1997|p=9}}.<\/ref>\n\nFor the next few years, she participated in [[ethnography|ethnographic]] expeditions to record traditional folklore and studied Lithuanian beliefs and rituals of death.<ref name=\"WareBraukman234\"\/> She graduated with honors from Au\u0161ra Gymnasium in Kaunas in 1938 and enrolled in the [[Vytautas Magnus University]] the same year, where she studied [[linguistics]] in the Department of [[Philology]]. She then attended the [[University of Vilnius]] to pursue [[graduate school|graduate studies]] in archaeology (under [[Jonas Puzinas]]), linguistics, [[ethnology]], folklore and [[literature]].<ref name=\"WareBraukman234\"\/> In 1941, she married [[architect]] Jurgis Gimbutas. The following year, she completed her master's thesis, \"Modes of Burial in Lithuania in the Iron Age\", with honors.<ref name=\"WareBraukman234\"\/> She received her Master of Arts degree from the University of Vilnius, Lithuania, in 1942.\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Gimbutas lived under [[History of Lithuania#First Soviet occupation|Soviet]] and [[History of Lithuania#Nazi occupation|Nazi occupation]] from 1940\u20131941 and 1941\u20131943, respectively.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ware|Braukman|2004|pp=234\u2013235}}.<\/ref> A year after the birth of their first daughter, Danut\u0117, in June 1942, the young Gimbutas family fled the country in the wake of the Soviet [[History of Lithuania#Return of Soviet authority|re-occupation]], first to [[Vienna]] and then to [[Innsbruck]] and [[Bavaria]].<ref name=\"WareBraukman235\">{{Harvnb|Ware|Braukman|2004|p=235}}.<\/ref> In her reflection of this turbulent period, Gimbutas remarked, \"Life just twisted me like a little plant, but my work was continuous in one direction.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Marler|1998|p=118}}.<\/ref> In 1946, Gimbutas received a [[doctorate]] in [[archaeology]], with minors in [[ethnology]] and [[history of religion]], from [[T\u00fcbingen University]] with her dissertation \"Prehistoric Burial Rites in Lithuania\" (in [[German language|German]]), which was published later that year.<ref name=\"WareBraukman235\"\/> While holding a postdoctoral fellowship at T\u00fcbingen the following year, Gimbutas gave birth to her second daughter, \u017divil\u0117. She did post-graduate work at the University of Heidelberg and the University of Munich in 1947\u20131949. The Gimbutas family left Germany and relocated to the United States in 1949.<ref name=\"WareBraukman235\"\/><ref>{{Harvnb|Chapman|1998|p=300}}.<\/ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Marler|1998|p=119}}.<\/ref>\n\n==Career==\nAfter arriving in the United States, Gimbutas immediately went to work at [[Harvard University]] translating [[Eastern European]] archaeological texts. She then became a lecturer in the Department of [[Anthropology]]. Her third daughter, Rasa Julija, was born August 1954 in Boston during this period. In 1955 she was made a Fellow of Harvard's [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody Museum]].\n\n===Kurgan hypothesis===\nIn 1956 Gimbutas introduced her ''[[Kurgan hypothesis]]'', which combined archaeological study of the distinctive ''[[Kurgan]]'' burial mounds with [[linguistics]] to unravel some problems in the study of the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) speaking peoples, whom she dubbed the \"Kurgans\"; namely, to account for their origin and to trace their migrations into [[Europe]]. This [[hypothesis]], and the act of bridging the disciplines, has had a significant impact on [[Indo-European studies]].\n\nDuring the 1950s and early 1960s, Gimbutas earned a reputation as a world-class specialist on the [[Bronze Age Europe|Indo-European Bronze Age]], as well as on [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]] [[folk art]] and the [[prehistory]] of the [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]], partly summed up in her definitive opus, ''Bronze Age Cultures of Central and Eastern Europe'' (1965). In her work she reinterpreted European prehistory in light of her backgrounds in [[linguistics]], [[ethnology]], and the [[Religious studies|history of religions]], and challenged many traditional assumptions about the beginnings of [[Culture of Europe|European civilization]].\n\nAs a Professor of European Archaeology and Indo-European Studies at [[UCLA]] from 1963 to 1989, Gimbutas directed major [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]]  of [[Neolithic]] sites in southeastern Europe between 1967 and 1980, including Anzabegovo, near [[\u0160tip]], [[Republic of Macedonia]], and [[Sitagroi]] and [[Achilleion (Thessaly)|Achilleion]] in [[Thessaly]] (Greece). Digging through layers of earth representing a period of time before contemporary estimates for Neolithic habitation in Europe&nbsp;\u2013 where other archaeologists would not have expected further finds&nbsp;\u2013 she unearthed a great number of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] of daily life and of [[Cult (religion)|religious cults]], which she researched and documented throughout her career. During her successful career, Gimbutas stated, \"After a millennium when the Hun Empire collapsed, a distinct [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] culture re-emerged and spread rapidly,\" and \"Neither [[Bulgars]] nor [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] colonized the [[Balkan]] Peninsula, after storming Thrace, Illyria and Greece they went back to their territory north of the Danube. It was the [[Slavs]] who did the colonizing.\"{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n===Late archaeology===\n[[File:Marija-Gimbutas-newgrange.jpg|thumb|right|187px|Marija Gimbutas by Kerbstone 52, at the back of [[Newgrange]], [[Co. Meath]], [[Ireland]], in September 1989]]\nGimbutas gained fame and notoriety in the English-speaking world with her last three English-language books: ''The Goddesses and Gods of Old Europe'' (1974); ''The Language of the Goddess'' (1989), which inspired an exhibition in [[Wiesbaden]], 1993-4; and the last of the three, ''The Civilization of the Goddess'' (1991), which, based on her documented archaeological findings, presented an overview of her conclusions about [[Neolithic]] cultures across Europe: housing patterns, social structure, art, religion, and the nature of literacy.\n\n''The Civilization of the Goddess'' articulated what Gimbutas saw as the differences between the Old European system, which she considered [[goddess]]- and woman-centered ([[gynocentric]]), and the Bronze Age Indo-European [[patriarchal]] (\"androcratic\") culture which supplanted it. According to her interpretations, gynocentric (or ''[[matristic]]'') societies were peaceful, honored women, and espoused [[Economic egalitarianism|economic equality]].\n\nThe androcratic, or male-dominated, Kurgan peoples, on the other hand, invaded Europe and imposed upon its natives the [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] rule of male [[warrior]]s.\n\nGimbutas' work, along with that of her colleague, [[mythology|mythologist]] [[Joseph Campbell]], is housed in the [[Pacifica Graduate Institute#Marija Gimbutas Collection at OPUS|OPUS Archives and Research Center]] on the campus of the Pacifica Graduate Institute in [[Carpinteria, California]]. The library includes Gimbutas' extensive collection on the topics of archaeology, mythology, folklore, art and linguistics. The Gimbutas Archives house over 12,000 images personally taken by Gimbutas of sacred figures, as well as research files on Neolithic cultures of Old Europe.<ref>http:\/\/www.opusarchives.org\/gimbutas_overview.shtml<\/ref>\n\n==Death==\nIn 1993, Marija Gimbutas received an honorary doctorate at Vytautas Magnus University in Kaunas, Lithuania. On 2 February 1994, Gimbutas died in Los Angeles, aged 73. Soon afterwards she was interred in Kaunas' [[Petra\u0161i\u016bnai Cemetery]].\n\n==Influence==\nGimbutas's theories have been extended and embraced by a number of [[neopaganism|neopagan]] authors. Gimbutas did identify the diverse and complex Paleolithic and Neolithic female representations she recognized as depicting a single universal [[Cybele|Great Goddess]], but also as manifesting a range of female deities: snake goddess, bee goddess, bird goddess, mountain goddess, Mistress of the Animals, etc., which were not necessarily ubiquitous throughout Europe.\n\nIn a tape entitled \"The Age of the Great Goddess,\" Gimbutas discusses the various manifestations of the Goddess which occur, and stresses the ultimate unity behind them: all of the [[Earth]] as feminine.\n\nIn 2004, filmmaker [[Donna Read]] and neopagan author and activist [[Starhawk]] released a collaborative documentary film about the life and work of Gimbutas, ''Signs Out of Time''.\n\n==Assessment==\n[[File:Gimbutas.jpg|thumb|Marija Gimbutien\u0117 commemorative plaque in [[Kaunas]], Mickevi\u010dius Street]]\n[[Joseph Campbell]] and [[Ashley Montagu]]<ref>\"According to anthropologist Ashley Montagu, \"Marija Gimbutas has given us a veritable Rosetta Stone of the greatest heuristic value for future work in the hermeneutics of archaeology and anthropology.\" [http:\/\/www.online.pacifica.edu\/cgl\/Gimbutasbio]<\/ref><ref name=\"Steinfels90\">[[Peter Steinfels]] (1990) ''[http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1DD1631F930A25751C0A966958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all Idyllic Theory Of Goddesses Creates Storm]''. NY Times, February 13, 1990<\/ref> each compared the importance of Marija Gimbutas' output to the historical importance of the [[Rosetta Stone]] in deciphering [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. Campbell provided a foreword to a new edition of Gimbutas' ''The Language of the Goddess'' (1989) before he died, and often said how profoundly he regretted that her research on the Neolithic cultures of Europe had not been available when he was writing ''[[The Masks of God]]''.\n\n===Criticism===\nMainstream archaeology dismissed Gimbutas' later works.<ref>Paul Kiparsky, \"[http:\/\/web.stanford.edu\/~kiparsky\/Papers\/handbook.pdf New perspectives in historical linguistics]\", [http:\/\/web.stanford.edu\/~kiparsky\/ To appear in Claire Bowern (ed.)Handbook of Historical Linguistics.]<\/ref> Anthropologist Bernard Wailes (1934\u20142012) of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] commented to ''The New York Times'' that most of Gimbutas's peers<ref>The New York Times book of science literacy: what everyone needs to know from Newton to the knuckleball, page - 85, Richard Flaste, 1992<\/ref> believe her to be \"immensely knowledgeable but not very good in critical analysis. ...She amasses all the data and then leaps from it to conclusions without any intervening argument.\" He said that most archaeologists consider her to be an eccentric.<ref name=\"Steinfels90\"\/>\n\nDavid Anthony has disputed Gimbutas's assertion that there was a widespread peaceful society prior to the Kurgan incursion, noting that Europe had hillforts and weapons, and presumably warfare, long before the Kurgan.<ref name=\"Steinfels90\"\/> A standard textbook of European prehistory corroborates this point, stating that warfare existed in neolithic Europe, and that adult males were given preferential treatment in burial rites.<ref>S. Milisauskas, ''European prehistory'' (Springer, 2002), p.82, 386, etc. See also Colin Renfrew, ed., ''The Megalithic Monuments of Western Europe: the latest evidence'' (London : Thames and Hudson, 1983).<\/ref>\n\nTwo early critics of the \"Goddess\" theory were Andrew Fleming and [[Peter Ucko]]. Ucko, in his 1968 monograph ''Anthropomorphic figurines of predynastic Egypt'' warned against unwarranted inferences about the meanings of statues. Ucko, for example, notes that early Egyptian figurines of women holding their breasts had been taken as \"obviously\" significant of maternity or fertility, but the Pyramid Texts revealed that in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] this was the female sign of grief.<ref>P. Ucko, ''Anthropomorphic figurines of predynastic Egypt and neolithic Crete with comparative material from the prehistoric Near East and mainland Greece'' (London, A. Szmidla, 1968).

Through the example of [[Knossos]] on the island of [[Crete]], which had been misrepresented as the paradigm of a pacifist, matriarchal and sexually free society, Gere claims that archaeology can easily slip into reflecting what people want to see, rather than teaching people about an unfamiliar past.<ref>Cathy Gere (2009), ''Knossos and the Prophets of Modernism'', University of Chicago Press, pp. 4 - 16ff.<\/ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Monographs===\n{{div col|2}}\n* Gimbutas, Marija (1946).

Nearly 7000 people come for the week and almost 350 fiddlers compete in 8 divisions. In addition to the contest there are workshops, performances, a battle of the bands, a parade and a carnival. The contest is held at [[Weiser High School]]. The competition is held in the gymnasium, and most of the contestants camp in the school\u2019s sports fields.\n\n==History==\nThe contest began in 1953 as the Northwest Mountain Fiddlers' Contest. It was organized by [[Blaine Stubblefield]], secretary of the Weiser Chamber of Commerce.<ref>{{cite web |url=http:\/\/www.fiddlecontest.com\/History.php |title=History of Fiddling, Fiddle Contests and the National Oldtime Fiddlers' Contest |author= |date= |work= |publisher=National Oldtime Fiddlers' Contest |accessdate=2010-06-09}}<\/ref> The contest increased in size each year, and competitors came from farther away. The name was changed to the Northwest Oldtime Fiddling Championships in 1956, when a regional division was added for out-of-area fiddlers. In 1963, the present National Oldtime Fiddlers' Contest was inaugurated. The contest has continued to grow since then, and now sets the standard for fiddling competitions across the nation.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http:\/\/www.fiddlecontest.com |title=National Oldtime Fiddlers Contest & Festival \u00bb The National Finals of Fiddling! |publisher=Fiddlecontest.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21}}<\/ref>\n\n==Style==\nThe dominant style of [[fiddling]] that is played in the competition is Texas Contest Style, although there are many other fiddling styles which are played during jam sessions that last well into the night. There are also performances on the contest stage between rounds of competition, where the fiddling styles range from swing to bluegrass to Celtic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.spokaneoutdoors.com\/weiser.htm |title=Army West to Army East |publisher=Spokaneoutdoors.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21}}<\/ref>\n\n==Rules==\nEach [[fiddler]] plays a set (or 'round') of three tunes, which must include a [[hoedown]], a [[waltz]] and a tune of choice, which can neither be a waltz or a hoedown. The fiddlers with the highest scores move on to the next round of competition. The number of fiddlers that get to play in each round is decided before the contest starts. In all divisions, only five fiddlers compete in the final round of competition. Scores are cumulative throughout the contest.<br \/>\nThe contest is divided into seven divisions: '''Small Fry,''' for contestants less than nine years of age; '''Junior-Junior''', for contestants less than 13 years of age; '''Junior''', for contestants less than 18 years of age; '''Young Adult''', for ages 18\u201336; '''Adult''', ages 37\u201359; '''Senior''', ages 60 and above; and finally, '''Grand Champion''', which is open to competitors of any age. No competitor may enter more than one of these divisions. There is no competition between divisions. There are three rounds of competition for the Small Fry and Junior-Junior divisions, four for the Junior, Young Adult, Adult and Senior divisions, and six for the Grand Championship.<br \/>\nIf a contestant wins an age specific division three times, they can no longer compete in that division, but they may play in the next most competitive division the next year (Small Fry and Junior-Junior move up to the next age group, all other ages move up to the Grand Championship). If a fiddler wins the Grand Championship three years, they are asked to sit out a year, and are invited to judge the contest instead of competing.<br \/>\nContestants may perform with up to three accompanists. No contestant may play the same tune twice. There is a time limit of four minutes for rounds one through three, five minutes for rounds four and five, and no time limit for the final round of the Grand Champion division. All contestants must use the microphone provided. No sheet music is allowed on stage and there is no 'trick' or 'fancy fiddling,' nor can there be any cross tuning on stage. Anyone may enter the contest.\n\n==Judging==\nThe judging criteria are: oldtime fiddling style, danceability, rhythm and timing, and tone quality. A simple tune, played well, is scored higher than a difficult tune that is played poorly. There are five judges and each gives up to a maximum score of 100 for each tune a fiddler plays. The highest judge's score as well as the lowest judge's score for the round are thrown out, leaving the middle three round scores to be added to a player's cumulative total (a perfect score for one round is 900). The judges are often fiddlers who have won the Grand Championship in the past, or fiddlers who are well known in other styles of fiddle music.<br \/>\nTo reduce bias, judging is done from a room away from the competition area. Judges only hear the number of the competitor and the performance. This does not prevent judges from recognizing fiddlers by their style. The one exception is the final round of the Grand Championship, during which the judges are in the front row, next to the stage.\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|National Oldtime Fiddlers&#39; Contest}} \n*[[List of old-time music festivals]]\n*[[List of folk festivals]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Music festivals in the United States]]\n[[Category:Festivals in Idaho]]\n[[Category:Visitor attractions in Washington County, Idaho]]\n[[Category:Performing arts in Idaho]]","timestamp":"20160410101017","user-timestamp":"20150410101017"},{"title":"User:PourDoc","content":"*","timestamp":"20160410101018","user-timestamp":"20150410101018"},{"title":"User talk:Marksmith66","content":"\n\n== June 2014 ==\n[[File:Information.svg|left|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia.

This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]]. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the [[WP:Your first article|guide to writing your first article]].\n\nIf you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding <code>{{tl|hangon}}<\/code> to the top of the article ('''just below''' the existing speedy deletion or \"db\" tag), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Be Hussey|the article's talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.\n\nFor guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|for biographies]], [[WP:WEB|for web sites]], [[WP:BAND|for bands]], or [[WP:CORP|for companies]].

During the [[Second Boer War]], Johnston was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] while serving with the [[Imperial Light Horse]]. The medal is displayed at the Light Horse Bar at The Saturday Club in [[Kolkata]], [[India]].

He is one of three Ireland rugby union internationals to have been awarded the Victoria Cross. The other two are [[Thomas Joseph Crean|Tom Crean]], who also served with the Imperial Light Horse in the Second Boer War, and [[Frederick Maurice Watson Harvey|Frederick Harvey]] who served in the [[First World War]]. Johnston, Crean and [[Frederick Maurice Watson Harvey|Harvey]] all played club rugby for [[Wanderers F.C. (rugby union)|Wanderers]].  In [[1896 British Lions tour to South Africa|1896]] Johnston and Crean were also members of the same British Lions squad that toured South Africa \n.<ref>[http:\/\/www.timesonline.co.uk\/tol\/sport\/article696385.ece    www.timesonline.co.uk]<\/ref><ref>[http:\/\/www.wanderers.ie\/info_wanderers-international-players.php      www.wanderers.ie]<\/ref> Johnston was also one of three alumni of [[King William's College]] to have been awarded the VC. The other two were [[George White (British Army officer)|George Stuart White]] and  [[Robert Henry Cain]]. White served in the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] and Cain served in the [[Second World War]].\n\n==Early years==\nJohnston was the son of Robert Johnston who served as [[Queen's Counsel]] in [[County Donegal]]. He was educated at [[King William's College]] on the  [[Isle of Man]].\n\n==Rugby international==\n\n===Ireland===\nIn [[1893 Home Nations Championship|1893]], Johnston made 2 appearances for \n[[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]]. He made his international debut on [[1893 Home Nations Championship#Ireland vs. England|4 February 1893]] in a 4-0 defeat against [[England national rugby union team|England]] at [[Lansdowne Road]]. Then on 11 March he played in a 2-0 defeat against [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] at [[Stradey Park]]\n.<ref>[http:\/\/www.irishrugby.ie\/227_7678.php?player=24007&includeref=dynamic www.irishrugby.ie]<\/ref><ref>[http:\/\/www.irishrugby.ie\/history\/css\/arch_history.htm   www.irishrugby.ie]<\/ref> Two of his brothers were also Ireland internationals \n.<ref name=\"Medal Society of Ireland\">{{Wayback |date=20091027153154 |url=http:\/\/geocities.com\/medal_society\/journal\/tcrean.html   |title=Medal Society of Ireland }}<\/ref>\n\n===British Lions===\nIn 1896 Johnston was a member of the [[British and Irish Lions|British Lions]] squad for their [[1896 British Lions tour to South Africa|tour to South Africa]]. He was part of strong Irish contingent, being one of nine Irishmen selected. The others included  [[Thomas Joseph Crean|Tom Crean]], [[Louis Magee]], [[James Magee|Jim Magee]], [[Lawrence Bulger|Larry Bulger]], [[Jim Sealy]], [[Andrew Clinch]], [[Arthur Meares]] and [[Cecil Boyd]].  He played in three of the four tests against [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]].<ref>[http:\/\/www.lionsrugby.com\/6012.php?player=20528&includeref=dynamic www.lionsrugby.com]<\/ref>\n\n==Military career==\nWhen the [[British and Irish Lions|British Lions]] tour ended, Johnston, together with   [[Thomas Joseph Crean|Tom Crean]], decided to stay on in [[South Africa]]. He played rugby for [[Golden Lions|Transvaal]] and captained them in the [[Currie Cup]]. In 1899, at the start of the [[Second Boer War]], again with Crean, he enlisted in the [[Imperial Light Horse]] and Johnston subsequently reached the rank of [[major]]. Johnston was already an experienced soldier, having previously served with the [[Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers]] between 1890 and 1894.  He served in South Africa between 1899 and 1901 and was dangerously wounded during the [[Siege of Ladysmith]]. In October 1899, according to the ''[[Irish Times]]'', the Imperial Light Horse particularly distinguished themselves in the [[Battle of Elandslaagte]] and it was during this engagement that Johnston, while still a [[Captain (land and air)|captain]], won his VC. The joint citation for him and [[Charles Herbert Mullins|Captain Charles Herbert Mullins]] reads:\n{{quote|On the 21st October, 1899, at Elandslaagte, at a most critical moment, the advance being momentarily checked by a very severe fire at point blank range, these two Officers very gallantly rushed forward under this heavy fire and rallied the men, thus enabling the flanking movement, which decided the day, to be carried out.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=27283|startpage=1059|date=12 February 1901|accessdate=25 November 2009}}<\/ref>}}\nJohnston was badly wounded and was nursed back to health by Crean. He travelled to London in early 1901, and both he and Mullins received the VC from [[Edward VII|King Edward]] during an investiture at [[Marlborough House]] 25 July 1901.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Court Circular |day_of_week=Friday |date=26 July 1901 |page_number=3 |issue=36517| }}<\/ref>\n\nMullins was the brother of [[Cuth Mullins]] who had earlier been one of Johnston\u2019s [[British and Irish Lions|British Lions]] team-mates. In 1902 he was Commandant at a [[List of concentration and internment camps|concentration camp]] at [[Middelburg, Mpumalanga]] and in 1903 he was a District Commissioner in the [[Eastern Transvaal]]. Johnston was awarded the [[Queen's South Africa Medal]] and bars and the [[King's South Africa Medal]] for his service.\n.<ref>[http:\/\/www.stephen-stratford.co.uk\/victoria_cross.htm www.stephen-stratford.co.uk]<\/ref><ref>[http:\/\/www.angloboerwar.com\/component\/content\/article\/12-victoria-cross\/199-johnston-robert www.angloboerwar.com]<\/ref><ref name=\"Find-A-Grave\">[http:\/\/www.findagrave.com\/cgi-bin\/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=11300023   Find-A-Grave]<\/ref><ref>[http:\/\/www.angelfire.com\/biz4\/bigbrian\/fearless.html www.angelfire.com]<\/ref><ref name=\"www.telegraph.co.uk\">[http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/sport\/columnists\/brendangallagher\/2340405\/Heroes-in-battle-and-on-the-field-of-play.html    www.telegraph.co.uk]<\/ref>\n\n[[File:Elandslaagte 1.jpg|250px|thumb|Charge of the 5th Lancers at Elandslaagte]]\n\n==Later years==\nIn 1911 Johnston returned to Ireland and joined the [[Her Majesty's Prison Service|Prison Service]].

The three layers that we are referring to are the endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm.(Moore,p.43,p59, 2011)\n\n\n==Abnormal implantation==\n\nImplantation occurs at the end of the first week. The trophoblast anchors to the endomentrial stroma from the uterus. Implantation may also occur outside the uterus, such as in the rectouterine pounch(pouch of Douglas), the mesentery, in the uterine tuve or in the ovary.\nAll this abnormal implantation is also known as ectopic pregnancies.( Moore,p.47-50, 2011)\n\n\n\n== Second week: Bilaminar germ disc==\n\nAfter the implantation on the uterus of the group of cells (morula: the zygote divided on 16 cells) immersed in the trophoblast on the first week, this cells will start to the develop the embryoblast on the start of the second week.\n\nThis week is also known as the week of the pairs because from the embryoblast will produce two layers as well as the trophoblast.\n\nThe two layers differentiated of the trophoblast are the cytotrophoblast (the inner layer of mononucleated cells) and the syncytiotrophoblast (the outer layer made by multinucleated cells). The citotrophoblast will hold the chorion ( the fetal part of the placenta in which chorionic villi will be developt to feed the fetus) to the endometrium of the uterus. The syncytiotrophoblast will erode the maternal capillarity to start the fetal circulation.(Sadler,p.43-44, 2012)\n\nNow talking about the embryoblast the one who gonna develop into a embryo, will also have 2 layers divisi\u00f3n. The first one is the epiblast that is the topcoat group of cells that in the third week will make the process of gastrulation. The second one is the hypoblast the undercoat group of cells that will make the yolk sac (from this structure will appear the first erythrocytes and germ cells for all the human systems) and the extraembryonic mesoderm.\n\nTogether the layers will flatten on a form of disc. At the same time cavities will appear, the first one two appear is the aminiotic cavity that will house the amnioblast then then this cells will produce the amnion (A membrane from the epiblast that will protect the fetus with the amniotic fluid).\n\nFort he 9 day the trophoblast will start a process known as lacunar stage in which the trophoblast have lacunar spaces and will erodes the maternal capillaries to produce an intercommunicating network between the maternal blood and the lacunar system then while the uteropacental circulation can start. Also in the day 9 the hipoblast cells invaginate and together with the exocoelomic membrane (cells from the cytotrophoblast) forms the primitive yolk sac.\n\nFor the day 13 the blood flow increased into lacunar spaces because this bleeding occurs near the 28th day of the menstrual cycle. Also is important to remember that the trophoblast is characterized by villous structures that are cells from the cytotrophoblast whom proliferate and pen\u00e9trate to the syncitiotrophoblast forming the primary villi.\n\nMeanwhile a different group of cells from the yolk sac form a connective tissue, the extraembryonic mesoderm. \n\nThe only place where extraembryonic mesoderm communicates with the chorionic cavity is the connecting stalk who will develop into umbilical cord.\n(Sadler,p.43-47, 2012)\n==Third week: Trilaminar germ disc ==\n\nThe third week is characterized for the formation of the primitive streak on the surface of the epiblast, the formation of the nothochord and the establishing of the 3 layers (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm).\nThe process of establish the three germ layers is also known as gastrulation. The gastrulation begins when the epiblast of the bilaminar germ disc form the primitive streak and the epiblast invaginate to this primitive streak making the endoderm and mesoderm , unlike the ectoderm are the cells that doesn\u2019t migrate and stay on the highest place of the epiblast make the ectoderm.The gen Nodal establish and develop the primitive streak and the fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF() induce the migration of the cells to the primitive streak.\nThe derivatives of the endoderm are epithelium of the respiratory system and digestive, liver and pancreas. The derivatives of the mesoderm are muscle layers, connective tissue, cardiovascular system , blood cells, bone marrow, skeleton and reproductory sistem. The derivatives of the ectoderm are epidermis, nervous system, eye and other sensitive structures.\nWhen cells move between the epiblast and hypoblast layers , they begin to spread laterally and superiorly then they establish contact with the extraembryonic mesoderm covering the yolk sac and the amnion forming the prechordal plate where prenotochordal cells will arrive and made the notochordal plate. As the hypoblast is replaced by endoderm cells they form the definitive notochord.\nThe notochord is a column of cells at the midline and will induct the neural plate, the motor regi\u00f3n of the brain and spinal cord, and the vertebrae.\nAlso in this week alot of genes will establish the body axes ( anteroposterior, dorsoventral, left and right takes place before and during the period of gastrulation.\nThe cells at the anterior margin of the embryonic disc is known as the anterior visceral endoderm (AVE) ,  this cells expresses transcription factors as OTX2, LIM1 and HESX1 that are essential for the head formation, also important the factors cerberus and lefty establish the cranial end of the  embryo before gastrulation.\nThe bone morphogenic protein 4(BMP4) with the Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) secreted by the embryonic disc induce the mesoderm to ventralized and contribut to divide the mesoderm on those cells migrating more posteriorly through the node and cranialmost aspect of the streak that will form paraxial mesoderm; those cells migrating through the next portion of the streak that will form intermediate mesoderm; those cells migrating through the more caudal part of the streak that will form lateral plate mesoderm; and those cells migrating through the most caudal that part will contribute to extraembryonic mesoderm. Each mesoderm will form different structures.\nThe left side is establish by the expression of LEFTY and PITX2 in which for the left side brain will contributes the serotonin (5HT) that is a broken down by its metabolizing enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO).From the right side is only known the factor Snail. Another important gene that function as barrier to prevent left-sided signals from crossing over is Sonic hedgehog (SHH). (Sadler,p.51-57, 2012).\n== Growth of the Embryonic Disc==\nThe embryonic disc , initially flat becomes elongated with a broad top(for the neural plate) and narrow bottom end. Growth caused and elongation of the top part are caused by the continous migration of cells from the primitive streak until the end of the fourth week then the primitive streak rapidly shrinks and disappears and continue developing until the birth. (Bravo, 2005) \n== Development of the trophoblast==\nThe trophoblast progresses rapidly. On the primary villi arise small capillaries when these villous capillaries make contact with capillaries in the chorionic plate and connect- ing stalk, the villous system is ready to supply the embryo with its nutrients and oxygen (Garc\u00eda, 2005)\n \n\n==Teratogens affect gastrulation==\nThe beginning of the third week , when gastrulation begins is highly sensitive stage for teratogenic atacks. At this time, fate maps can be made for various organs systems, such as the eyes and bran anlage(a precursor or forerunner or a more mature structure), and these cell populations may be damaged by teratogens.

Accents belong to non-native speakers; dialects are geographical or social variations among the native speakers.\n\n==Americentric==\nThis article seems to have been written from a US point of view - there is a list of 'general' characteristics for people from the UK, but not a similar one for Americans. I think that it would be good to add such a category. Unfortunately I'm unable to do so myself. [[User:Andre Engels|Andre Engels]] 14:31 Sep 21, 2002 (UTC)\n\n:: Indeed!

Are there fewer accents of Russian in Russia, fewer accents of Spanish in Spain, etc.? -- [[User:Zoe|Zoe]]\n\n:I meant English accents and dialects.  After all that was the topic of the article. -- [[User:Derek Ross|Derek Ross]] | [[User talk:Derek Ross | Talk]]\n\n==Midwest America==\nI've only heard \"naht\" around Chicago...naht on the west coast, or even Nebraska.  Hence I narrowed the \"Midwest and West Coast\" to \"Midwest (Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin)\".  This accent can probably also be found in Iowa, North Dakota, and South Dakota, but I can't personally vouch for that.  It's not prevalent in Nebraska, Colorado, Wyoming, or Montana, as I recall from living in or visiting many of these states, and definitely not prevalent in Washington, Oregon or Idaho.  As it turns out, the generic American accent of television anchors is deliberately a Nebraska-ish accent, if what I'm told is true - [[User:RobLa|RobLa]] 01:52 Dec 15, 2002 (UTC)\n\nSpeaking of Midwest America, I live in Illinois ([[Crawford County]], to be exact), and, despite what this article says, most people here in southeastern Illinois (and southwestern Indiana as well) ''don't'' pronounce \"roof\", \"book\", and \"root\" with the same vowel. \"Roof\"  (pronunciations in IPA, I'm new to IPA, so sorry if I'm a bit off) (\/ru:f\/) and \"root\" (\/ru:t\/) have the same vowel, but \"book\" (\/b&#650;k\/) doesn't. However, my grandfather pronounces \"Bush\" as \/bu:&#643;\/ and \"fish\" as \/fi:&#643;\/, though most younger people use the Standard Midwestern\/General American accent, so I don't know if it has to do with age, or if it's a regional thing. --[[User:Evice|Evice]] 07:09, Dec 20, 2004 (UTC)\n\n==Australia and NZ==\nAccents ''do'' vary more in the places where the language originated. This is a well-documented phenomenon which can be used by archeologists to trace the movements of peoples back to their ancestral homes; alas, the proper term for it escapes me at the moment. \n\nAlso, I just corrected some mistakes in the Australan section - Oz and NZ accents are very different: instantly recognisable to a native born Australian or New Zealander. I'd imagine that (e.g.) a Canadian or a Californian would notice, but don't know for sure. New Zealand accents can be tricky, as they seem to vary more with social class (working class NZ is similar in some ways to outback Oz, but still has the distinctive \"i\"s and \"e\"s of an educated NZ accent), and also as many NZers spend a few years working in Oz and wind up speaking with a mixture of the two accents. As a native-born Australian, I was astonished to see Peter Garret (until last week, the lead singer of Midnight Oil) cited as having a \"thick accent\"! Not a good example. Note that many Australians who are prominent overseas do ''not'' have typical Oz accents - the golfer Greg Norman, for example has a heavy American overlay, and no-one would know from press baron Rupert Murdoch's (News Corp, London Times, Fox & etc) accent that he was born in Melbourne. [[User:Tannin|Tannin]]\n\nWhile Australia is a close neighbour I believe it is wrong to say that a sufficient majority of NZers work in Oz and return with affected accents to change our national accent as a whole, while this may have been true in the past I feel that a greater influence on our accent is the media we are exposed to. NZ Television has only just, for the most part, gotten off the ground (up until a few years ago our news broadcasters still spoke \"BBC English\") the majority of our television is sourced from the US with small proportions from the UK, Australia and NZ. This has had, and will continue to have, a tremendous effect on our accent.\nAnother aspect to consider is that a growing proportion of NZ's population is immigrating from overseas. Because NZ has a relatively small population it's accent can easily be influenced by the number of migrants from Australia & the UK and increasingly Asia & the Pacific Islands [[Special:Contributions\/219.89.250.11|219.89.250.11]] ([[User talk:219.89.250.11|talk]]) 12:27, 4 February 2011 (UTC)\n\n: I tend to agree with this; being an Australian myself, some of the [[SAMPA]] vowels cited in the Australian accent section are at the extreme end of the scale. [[Steve Irwin]]'s vowels may sound like these, but the so-called \"Australian\" vowels seem to have been taken from either him or an American actor trying to parody an Australian accent. Some of them are right on the money - \/'''{U'''\/ for the vowel in ''now'', for instance - but \/'''@U'''\/ for ''soon''? \/'''U:'''\/ is far closer. As well, the '''l''' in \"Australia\" is not ''smashed'', it may be '''elided''', but it certainly is nothing like universal. It brings back to mind the old stereotype that the Australian pronunciation of \"Australian\" is ostensibly ''Strine'' (SAMPA \/str@In\/), which may be humorous, but from what I can tell, this isn't intended to be a joke article. I've fixed this up where necessary. As well, people from the south - particularly [[Adelaide]] and environs, in South Australia - may pronounce ''dance'' or ''plant'' as SAMPA \/da:ns\/ and \/pla:nt\/ respectively. Again, though, this is by no means universal.[[User:thefamouseccles|thefamouseccles]]\n\nJust added IPA for the SAMPA, but there was one vowel that doesn't seem to be SAMPA at all - [o:] in the description of <i>gone<\/i>.

Human, was pronounced uman, Holy as oly etc.  Later I purposely made the aspirated h as part of my speech.  As a young man I did find the regional differences interesting.  Wellington has somewhat of a \"posh\" sound to the rural ear, and my own accent sounds rather broad in the lower north island, but perfectly at home in the Bay.

My parents came from France and El Salvador. I work with computers and sometimes talk about routers, which I pronounce with the vowel of \"boot\". Everybody else around here calls them \"routers\", rhyming with \"pouters\". To me that's a woodworking tool. It routs. A network router routes. I also rhyme \"root\" with \"boot\", but I've heard of pronouncing it to rhyme with \"foot\". This sometimes causes confusion when I tell someone to run route as root. They su route or run \/sbin\/root. Do I say \"route\" because I'm from California and Ohio, or because my second native language is French? -[[User:PierreAbbat|phma]]\n\n:Actually, the source of the rhyme with \"pouters\" is because many people (in Minnesota, anyway) rhyme \"route\" and \"pout\".  Hence, [rawtrz] instead of [rutrz].  Hope that helps...  BTW, for me \"root\" and \"roof\" rhyme with \"foot\", not \"boot\".  :-)  I've heard \"roof\" with the vowel of \"boot\", but not \"root\", and it will mark someone as non-Minnesotan to rhyme \"roof\" with \"boot\".  [[pgdudda]]\n\n::I'm guessing [[User:PierreAbbat|phma]] learned these pronunciations due to a logical assimilation of English (which brings knowledge of French to the fore as a reason); problem is, English is rarely logical.  Rhyming \"route\" with \"boot\" is logical; however, every American I've talked to (including Californians) rhymes \"router\" with \"pouter\".\n\n::\"Root\" rhyming with \"foot\", on the other hand, I've noticed mostly in the southern US (Texas and Georgia, so it would make sense in NC as well).  I see that as a regionalism, and not even unanimous in the region (especially among computer techs).\n\n::[[User:Hephaestos|Hephaestos]]\n\n:::I grew up in Washington and Florida and I agree that a r-ow-t-er is a woodworking tool.  But most computer people I've spoken to (which isn't a lot) seem to use the pronunciation you and Hephaestos attest is the more common.  My very old dictionary defines \"router\" as \"a person or thing that routs\" and gives the ow pronunciation.  It also gives the primary pronunciation of \"route\" as the oo one, but says that sometimes, and often in the case of definition 3, it is pronounced the same as rout.  Definition 3 is an order \"in military usage\".  Definition 1 is a road or path taken...\n:::  -- [[User:SS|SS]] 20:28, 25 Aug 2004 (UTC)\n\n: In Australia, the \"pout\" pronounciation is used because pronoucing it the other way turns it into a local rude word...\n\nnot true - i'm a west australian, and everyone i know pronounces 'route' and 'root' the same way. 'root' can be a rude word, but it also relates to the below-ground parts of a tree, and is pronounced with the 'oo' in this case also :o) locally 'route' pronounced with an 'ow' sound would be recognised as belonging to an american accent.\n\nYes it is true.  Rooting is a local rude word.  I use router (as like rooter) because I am a stirrer and like to poke fun at peoples prudishness. After causing a stir, in which they say it sounds rude, I then remind them that local pronunciation of route is like (root), and a router routes things so it should be pronounced as rooter, and to stop sounding like Americans.  They roll their eyes and keep calling it a router (as in pouter).  All good fun.\nBy the way the other reason that saying router as rooter is unpopular, is that rooted is a adjective to describe a piece of equipment that is unserviceable.  No one would like a rooter to root (that is break\/destroy) the network.\n[[User:Tony.wallace.nz|Tony.wallace.nz]] ([[User talk:Tony.wallace.nz|talk]]) 09:34, 22 February 2012 (UTC)\n\n==Canadian About, Aboat, Aboot==\nHow \"A Boot\" not having that silly Canadian comment.

There are plenty of people in the UK without respiratory diseases, and they have no problem with the accent.

Perhaps because they seem to be from one of the few provinces which doesn't say \"aboat\".  It's certainly common in Alberta and BC but I've never heard anyone say it in Ontario or NS.

Some sections of Ontario pronounce it differently. A notable example is the Ottawa \"valley\" accent.

British RP does not strongly palatalise \/l\/ sounds, but does velarise them after a vowel and before another consonant, as in \"bell\" or \"milk\". This gives the \"l\" a \"ol\" or \"ul\" quality, as noted by Tolkien in one of the appendices to \"Lord of the Rings\" (when describing how elves would have written Modern English\". Ulster, Scottish lowland\/midland and many American accents use the velarised \"dark\" \/l\/ much more widely. Conversely, Welsh and Southern Irish accents use it less. Welsh \/l\/ tends to be neutral-to-clear even after a vowel and before a consonant (like German), while Irish English inherits the habits of Irish Gaelic, which treats palatalised and velarised \/l\/ as separate phonemes (like Russian). [[Michael Howard]] was born in South Wales of immigrant Romanian-Jewish parents, all of which would tend to make his \/l\/ sounds less velar than usual in England.

There is a \"subjunctive <b>mood<\/b>\". And it's not completely lost since even in the writer's illustration a single past form (rather than the plural past form) is being used which is <b>never<\/b> used in a non-subjunctive mood in the present. A <b>complete<\/b> loss would be \"I wouldn't do that if I <b>am<\/b> you\". &mdash; and nobody would ever say that. In any case this development in the English subjunctive is present in just about every dialect that I'm exposed to - not just Estuary English.\n\nOther loaded POV words which need to go are \"mangle\" and \"smashed\".

[[User:Adambisset|Adambisset]] 13:22, 23 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nThat could be a Gaelic thing. The Irish pronounce loch (or lough) the same way.

The holocaust and the war made New York City the home of the largest population of Jews in the world for decades. When the survivor population aged to retirement,-- i believe in the 70's for the majority-- there was a massive migration to Florida. Florida, is afterall the retirement capital of the country. Because of this, New York no longer houses the largest jewish population, and a large portion of Florida's population is Jewish, New Yorker. Hence that certain strain of floridian accent that's suspiciously similar to Jewish New Yorker. (Mary Bluestocking, 20, Nov. 2005)\n\nI live in Florida, although I am a transplant from Philadelphia.

The [[Hiberno-English]] article seems to think so, and it would be somewhat ludicrous to argue that Irish hasn't affected Northern Irish speech. Isn't Mid-Ulster English a variant of Hiberno-English, as opposed to them being two distinct things? \n\nAlso, isn't it rather confusing to be discussing a ''dialect'' in an article about ''accents'', as though the two terms were freely interchangeable?

For instance, I am Australian and have noticed many accent similarities between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal English speakers. Obviously some of these similarities come from loanwords used by non-Aboriginal Australians such as 'kangaroo' and 'barramundi', but does this borrowing extend beyond Aboriginal words to English ones? Does the mainstream Australian accent have influences from Aboriginal languages, or are Aboriginal-English accents affected by the ways non-Aboriginal speakers talk? Some examples of the kind of thing I'm thinking of are the widespread substitution of 'd' for 't', as in \"gedoudovit\" (\"get out of it\"), the common omission of an 'r' sound, as in \"haahdly\" (\"hardly\"), \"neeahly\" (\"nearly\"), \"paahk\" (\"park\"), etc, and the 'Aboriginalisation' of non-Aborignal words such as 'Nullarbor' (which is actually Latin but is never pronounced that way). It also seems to me that something similar is happening with Maori and non-Maori New Zealand English speakers, and First Nations and non-Indigenous American and Canadian English speakers. The reason I ask this is it seems that large parts of the Australian and New Zealand accents in particular seem quite far removed from their supposed English\/Scottish\/Irish origins.\n[[User:130.95.121.91|130.95.121.91]] 04:54, 24 November 2006 (UTC) machyak\n:All of the examples you give of \"Aboriginalisation\" in Australian accents also appear in some British and\/or Irish accents, so I would need to see more evidence of this.

How is this described on Wikipedia? I couldn't find it in any article I looked in.

The stereotypical Indian etc. pronunciation of \"p\" is somewhere in between \"p\" and \"b\" in standard English pronunciation, for example in the phrase \"make a purchase\", it's almost like \"burchase\", but not quite.

I have no idea what a brrr is.\n\nThe Corkonian accent has a unique lyrical intonation. Every sentence typically ends in the trademark elongated tail-off on the last word. In Cork heavier emphasis yet is put on the brrr sound to the letter R.\n\nSimilar to the Cork accent but without the same unmistakable intonation, Kerry puts even heavier emphasis on the brrr sound to the letter R. For example: the word Forty. Throughout the south this word is pronounced whereby the r exhibits the typified Irish brrr. In Kerry however (especially in rural areas) the roll on the r is enforced with vibrations from the tongue (not unlike Scottish here). \"Are you?\" becomes a co-joined \"A-rrou?\" single tongue flutter (esp. in rural areas). This extra emphasis on R also seen in varying measures through parts of West Limerick and West Cork in closer proximity to Kerry.  <span style=\"font-size: smaller;\" class=\"autosigned\">\u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions\/190.161.180.214|190.161.180.214]] ([[User talk:190.161.180.214|talk]]) 18:11, 9 June 2011 (UTC)<\/span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\n\n==Links to dialect pages==\nIn the England section, many links have been redirected to the dialect page rather than the geographical region page, which typically is primarily focused on a modern administrative division not always co-extensive with traditional accent\/dialect areas.

While I agree that racist is pejorative, segregationalist may not have been necessarily correct.  Was the original writer trying to state that the campaign itself was the last campaign in the U.S. that was openly racist or was he trying to say that it was the last campaign to openly advocate segregation (as you have changed it to say) or both.  I don't know the facts, and someone should research this issue to verify exactly what the significance of the campaign was.  I just wanted to check with you whether you were aware of how you have subtly changed the meaning of this portion of the article and maybe not in the way that the original author intended or is backed up by the facts.

It would be false for us not to properly identify their views. -[[User:Will Beback|Will Beback]] 08:57, 12 May 2006 (UTC)\n\n:Using your logic we should remove \"lefist\", \"left-wing\", \"right-wing\", \"rightist\", \"conservative\", \"liberal\", and all similar tags. except that you are only removing \"far-right\", and that appears to be forwarding a POV. -[[User:Will Beback|Will Beback]] 09:17, 12 May 2006 (UTC)\n\n::At the same time that you removed \"far left\" in regard to a socialist party you added, \"The BNP is accused of being far right and neo fascist but they vehemently deny such accusations.\" I can find no mention of \"far right\" on the BNP website. On what basis did you add that assertion? -[[User:Will Beback|Will Beback]] 09:32, 12 May 2006 (UTC)\n:::Let me ask that again more slowly. According to what source does the BNP \"vehemently deny\" being \"far right\" or \"neo fascist\". It sounds a lot like that is your own interpretation. What happened to \"allow readers to make up their own mind\"? -[[User:Will Beback|Will Beback]] 09:50, 12 May 2006 (UTC)\n\n::This is from the same page:\nThe BNP is generally not regarded as economically right-wing, i.e., as having a strong belief in laissez-faire economics. Rather, the description of them as 'far-right' relates to their authoritarian policies, and beliefs concerning racial segregation [18]. The Thatcherite former Conservative Party Chairman Lord Tebbit has said on the BNP\u2019s position on the political spectrum that having \u201ccarefully re-read\u201d the BNP\u2019s 2005 general election manifesto that he is \u201cunable to find evidence of Right-wing tendencies\u201d believing it to be \u201cpretty Left-wing\u201d in his opinion [19].\n\nEven the same page says that using far right can actually not be accurate. The BNP officially denies being fascist. I dont know where the link is but that is their official stance. They do not say \"Yes, we are fascists.\" as of today. I assure you they deny this as of today. If you think it's wrong take it down. I am not saying they arent neo fascists I am just repeating what they said. Feel free to read their website and talk to BNP members and they will deny being fascists. As I told you before I only set that as an example I didnt expect this sentence to stay up. \n\n[[User:Jerry Jones|Jerry Jones]] 10:07, 12 May 2006 (UTC)\n\nYou added a positive assertion that they not only deny, but \"vehemently deny\", being \"neo fascist\" or \"far right\". Yet, apparently there is no source for them doing so. You are asking me to rely on your personal assurance that they told you so. Do you understand why that is not acceptable? Are you familiar with [[WP:V]]? What BNP members have said to you is not usable as a reliable source. -[[User:Will Beback|Will Beback]] 10:33, 12 May 2006 (UTC)\n\n*How is that a positive assertion? I just tried to balance out the article from the anti fascist liberal overtone i was receiving to make it more credible. Nobody wants to read anti nationalist\/racist attacks from liberals on wikipedia they do not come here to get a repeat of CNN. Let me give you an example of what I was doing. This is from a pretty big article on wiki and I didnt write it:\n\n'''Johnson and the BNP are described by all commentators except those from the Front to be far right.''' \n\nDo you see how this is balanced? They are not stating far right as a fact because its an opinion and describe it that way. Then they let the reader read all the information and they can make up their own mind if the people are racist or not. You dont see me removing information when the BNP admits they were racist down in the article because its a fact. I also didnt remove the term \"far right\" because it was used in a balanced way. I speak with these groups frequentley and a lot of the articles I do on wikipedia are about them. I know what all of these groups say I just cant find a source at the momement and I dont really care to look for one. I only added that as a sentence because i knew editors were going to go into an edit war with me and i added that to try to give them an example on something we can all agree upon. If you want to remove it I dont care just please dont put in \"far right\" in most cases of articles. \n\nBtw for the Mellisa Guile page you will see that I didnt remove the statement \"Mellisa is a racist person from Canada\" because apparantly she admits it. I will leave anything just as long as its a fact and not an opinion. \n\n[[User:Jerry Jones|Jerry Jones]] 19:32, 12 May 2006 (UTC)\n\n::There is a world of difference between the BNP not calling itself \"far right\", and it \"vehemently\" denying the use of the term. As far as I can tell, you either made that up with no source, or it is the result of somenthing that an BNP member told you personally. Either way, such material does not belong in this encyclopedia. Frankly, it calls into question your undserstanding of what we do here, and makes me think that you are trying to whitewash nationalist groups. -[[User:Will Beback|Will Beback]] 19:51, 12 May 2006 (UTC)\n\n:::A new user put a comment about another article and another editor having quasi-neocon views.

I just would prefer to show all of the information and let people draw their own conclusions which would not jeopardize wiki NPOV policy. Racism is an opinion not a fact when it comes down to it. I just dont think we should allow to over use the term because it will be broadly defined by a certain group and people and this is not right.

I just am apprehensive to use the word racism every sentence and label everything relating to race issues racism because 90 percent of the time its an opinion stated as a fact. There are plenty of articles where I dont remove racism. I also left the word racist in the KKK article as an ideology that the KKK preached but I removed it at the bottom and everyone jumps on me.

Drivers can access the road from state highway [[M-26 (Michigan highway)|M-26]] on either end near [[Eagle Harbor, Michigan|Eagle Harbor]] to the west or Copper Harbor to the east in the [[Keweenaw Peninsula]]. The drive runs along the ridge of '''Brockway Mountain''' on the [[Keweenaw Fault]] and climbs to {{convert|1320|ft|m|0}} above sea level, {{convert|720|ft|m}} above the surface of [[Lake Superior]]. Several viewpoints along the route allow for panoramas of Copper Harbor, Lake Superior, and undeveloped woodland. On a clear day, [[Isle Royale]] is visible approximately {{convert|50|mi|km}} in distance from the top of the mountain.\n\nBrockway Mountain was named for Daniel D. Brockway, one of the pioneer residents of the area. The road was constructed by the county road commission with funding through [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era work programs in 1933. It was briefly used as a connection for the parallel state highway after it opened. Since it opened, Brockway Mountain Drive has been recognized nationally and locally in several media outlets for its picturesque qualities, usually in profiles of [[Keweenaw County, Michigan|Keweenaw County]], the Upper Peninsula or other scenic drives.\n\n== Route description ==\nThe road can be accessed from either Eagle Harbor or Copper Harbor and serves as a scenic loop off M-26. The western end starts at M-26 near Lake Bailey and Agate Harbor. Brockway Mountain Drive ascends along the ridgeline of the Keweenaw Fault. Immediately south of the road, Upson Creek runs parallel to the cliff face as it drains Lake Upson.<ref name=googleBMD\/> Two and a half miles (4.0&nbsp;km) <!-- {{convert|2+1\/2|mi|km|spell=in}} --> from the western end, there is a parking area for the Oren Krumm Trail, part of the Brockway Mountain Audubon Sanctuary.<ref name=BMAS>{{cite web |author= Keweenaw Convention & Visitors Bureau |url=http:\/\/www.keweenaw.info\/details_378_brockwaymountainaudubonsanctuary.aspx |title=Brockway Mountain Audubon Sanctuary |publisher=Keweenaw Convention & Visitors Bureau |year=2001 |accessdate=January 26, 2011 |archiveurl=http:\/\/replay.waybackmachine.org\/20090206220535\/http:\/\/keweenaw.info\/details_378_brockwaymountainaudubonsanctuary.aspx |archivedate=February 6, 2009}}<\/ref> The drive is lined with low stone walls, built as part of the original construction of the roadway.<ref name=NSBP\/>\n\n[[File:Brockway Mountain Lake Superior.jpg|thumb|left|View of Lake Superior from Brockway Mountain with information signage|alt=There are wooden information signs in the foreground, left and Lake Superior in the distance beyond the top of Brockway Mountain.]]\nUpon reaching the top of the mountain, drivers are greeted with a full panoramic view of the surrounding area, allowing views of Lake Superior, Copper Harbor, Eagle Harbor and the surrounding lakes and forests.  Freighters occasionally can be seen traversing Lake Superior, and on clear days [[Isle Royale]] can be spotted nearly {{convert|50|mi|km}} in the distance.<ref name=hunt>{{cite book |last1=Hunt |first1=Mary |last2=Hunt |first2=Don |chapter= Brockway Mountain Drive |year=2007 |title=Hunts' Guide to Michigan's Upper Peninsula |publisher= Midwestern Guides |location=Albion, MI  |url=http:\/\/hunts-upguide.com\/ |chapterurl= http:\/\/hunts-upguide.com\/copper_harbor_brockway_mountain_drive.html |accessdate=February 21, 2008 |lastauthoramp=y}}<\/ref>\n\nContinuing eastward, the drive descends down the mountain toward Copper Harbor. The roadway twists and turns as it alternately climbs and descends several smaller hills along the ridgeline. Along the drive, several viewpoints provide the opportunity to pull off and take in the surroundings. A few of them lie directly adjacent to the face of the bluff where the mountain quickly rises from the surrounding land.

The road was designed in 1932 with three different options considered. The first involved the construction of the current road from near the Silver River on the west to the summit. It followed a route used by the previous [[U.S. Route 41 in Michigan#Military Road|Military Road]] that connected [[Fort Wilkins]] to [[Fort Howard (Wisconsin)|Fort Howard]]; traffic would have to turn around to descend Brockway Mountain. Another option included a route from the summit southwest across the Upson Creek Valley to a second summit on the nearby Mount Lookout, a total of about {{convert|16|mi|km}}.

The church is dedicated to [[Lawrence of Rome|Saint Lawrence]] who was martyred in 258 AD.\n\n==History==\nThe exact date of the construction of the church is not known but the style of the aisle-less [[nave]] which is the oldest part of the current building, is early [[Norman architecture|Norman]] and dates it to the 11th century. The church is constructed in [[Flint#As a building material|flint work]] and the external south wall which also dates from the Norman period is typical of early work with this material with whole flints laid in wide courses. The south wall had a double splayed window which is also typical of the early Norman period, it was not rediscovered until a 1960s refurbishment. Further expansion of the church continued with the external north wall being constructed in the early 12th century with more loose coursed flints. The [[Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular]] windows in the south wall were added in the 1350s and indicate the modifications in design and construction after the impact of the [[Black Death in England|Black Death]]. A three stage tower was added around 1370 at the west end of the church, this probably replaced an earlier tower.<ref name=\"Historic England\">[http:\/\/list.historicengland.org.uk\/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1049189&searchtype=mapsearch Historic England] Gives details of architecture and some history.<\/ref>\n\nThe church underwent a substantial reconstruction in the middle part of the  15th century. The three stage tower was raised to its current height with the addition of a belfry with decorative [[battlement]]s, it was also strengthened by two diagonal buttresses and modifications to the tower arch. The belfry originally had three bells but two of these were sold in 1746, the remaining bell was cast by the bell founders William Brend of [[Norwich]]. The south [[transept]] was also added at this time and its fine construction and design indicates it was probably a gift from a wealthy patron of the church, it was used as the [[Lady chapel]] with a [[piscina]] for washing the church vessels. The internal roof of the south transept is the only medieval woodwork left in the church. The south [[porch]] was also added during the 15th century restoration, this disproportionately tall building was typical of the middle 15th century, the lower diagonal buttresses have a flint design of an L with a crown and a griddle on top and refers to the martyrdom of St Lawrence.<ref name=\"Norfolk coast\">[http:\/\/norfolkcoast.co.uk\/churches\/ch_hunworth.htm Norfolk Coast] Gives historical details.<\/ref>\n[[File:Hunworth Church slab.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Memorial to Edmund and Henrietta Britliffe]]\nIn 1779 the original [[chancel]] was devastated in the great New Year gale of that year, many of the original [[medieval]] features were lost, including [[stained glass]] windows, wall paintings and [[rood screen]]. The chancel was not rebuilt until 1850 when the Reverend [[James Bulwer]] directed the restoration and includes the triple [[Lancet window|lancet]] east window. Bulwer was St Lawrence\u2019s most famous incumbent and became Rector in 1848, he was a well known antiquarian and artist. He amassed a huge collection of historical papers, many of which are now at [[Norwich Castle]] Museum. He was also a gifted artist who was a friend of [[John Sell Cotman]] and a patron of [[Frederick Sandys]]. Several of Bulwer\u2019s watercolours of St Lawrence\u2019s church are stored in Norwich Castle Museum. His modest grave is on the north side of the churchyard. [[Poppyhead (carving)|Poppyhead]] benches were added to the church during the chancel rebuilding of 1850.<ref name=\"church leaflet\">''\"Hunworth Church History\"'', Hunworth PCC (August 2008), No ISBN (leaflet), Gives comprehensive history.<\/ref> In 1935 [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere]] spent several hundred pounds on interior fittings and furnishings, including copies of the [[Book of Common Prayer]], the brass altar vase and the eagle [[lectern]].<ref name=\"Briningham Benefice\">[http:\/\/www.brininghambenefice.org.uk\/c_hunworth.php Briningham Benifice] Details of Viscount Rothermere.<\/ref>\n\n===Interior===\nThe medieval [[font]] stands underneath the west tower, there is a small statue of the church\u2019s patron Saint Lawrence in an alcove on the north side while the floor has ceramic tiling.

Dayna has three children Andrew, Madison and Sage.    She attended and graduated Marlboro High School and went on to attend and graduate from Douglass College (Rutgers University) in New Brunswick, New Jersey, where she majored in English.\n\nDayna worked in marketing after college, where she began to learn graphic design.  In doing so, she learned that she loved to edit images for marketing brochures.    That followed with an interest in photography, and her career took a new path when, in 2008, Dayna launched her own photography business Dayna Titus Photography (previously known as Artistic Captures).     At that time, she specialized in lifestyle and portraiture for local clients.     Though very successful and having won several awards (including the completion of a 365 project and named winner of a 1,600 entry photo contest thru www.365project.org), she decided in 2013 to focus on a more family-friendly schedule.\n\nCurrently, Dayna Titus is partnered with Getty Images to provide them with quality stock images for use worldwide, in print and on the web.    Dayna's images have been seen in magazines in Europe and South Africa, as well as dozens of websites. \n\nIn addition, Dayna spends a fair amount of time serving on the Jewish National Fund's Northern California Board of Directors (www.jnf.org).    She is a Sapphire Society and President's Society member, having traveled to Israel several times to support philanthropic projects.\n\nDayna Titus and her family reside in Pleasanton, CA.","timestamp":"20160410101048","user-timestamp":"20150410101048"},{"title":"User talk:Mbarak~enwiki","content":"== Your account will be renamed ==\n\n<div class=\"plainlinks mw-content-ltr\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\nHello,\n\nThe developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications.

It is one of the four terrestrial planets in our Solar System. This means most of its mass is solid. The other three are Mercury, Venus, and Mars. The Earth is also called the Blue Planet, \"Planet Earth\", and \"Terra\".\n\nThe Earth is home to millions of species of plants and animals, including humans. Earth is the only planet in the galaxy known to support life. Earth has many places that are suitable for humans to live in, although some areas of the planet can are dangerous or uninhabitable.\n\nScience shows that Earth formed around 4.5 billion years ago.  The organisms that live on Earth have completely changed its air (atmosphere); this is called a biosphere. \n\n71% of Earth's surface is covered in salt water oceans. Earth is the only place in the Solar System where liquid water is known to exist at present. The other 29% is made of rocky land in the shape of continents and islands.\n\nEarth interacts with other objects in the Solar System, particularly the Sun and the Moon. The Earth orbits the Sun roughly once every 365.25 days. One spin is called a 'day' and one orbit around the Sun is called a 'year'. This is why there are 365 days in a year, but a leap day added to the calendar once every 4 years.<ref>Gnawledge, O'penn. \"Planet Earth in the Balance of History\". Science and Nature Journal. SandNjournal.com\/Earthinthebalance. March 21, 20. Retrieved April 24th, 2013.<\/ref>\n\n== Shape and structure ==\n[[File:The Blue Marble.jpg|thumbnail|wolrd]]\n\nEarth is a terrestrial planet. This means it is made up of solid rock unlike a gas giant such as Jupiter. It is the largest out of the four terrestrial planets in mass and diameter. The Earth's shape is an oblate spheroid. This means it is basically a sphere but it bulges around the middle. The [[circumference]] of the Earth is about 40,000 kilometers; the average width of the Earth is about 12,700 kilometers. The highest point on Earth is the peak of Mount Everest at 8,848 meters above sea level. The lowest natural point is the bottom of the Mariana Trench at 10,911 meters below sea level. Because of the bulge at the middle or the equator, the farthest point from the Earth's center is the top of Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador.<ref>\"Origin of the Moon and Earth\". Reisch, Maggy. Nature.com: Volume 10:2, p.19-27. http.www.nature.com\/102\/Reisch\/Earth. Retrieved 2009-07-28.<\/ref>\n\nInside, the Earth is similar to the other terrestrial planets. It has an outer, solid rock layer called the crust. Everything that lives on Earth is on top of the crust. Below that is a layer of thick, semi-liquid rock called the mantle. Under that is a thin liquid layer called the outer core and then the solid iron inner core. The thickness of the crust changes. On land the average is between 30\u201350 kilometers thick. Under the oceans in some places it is only 6 kilometers thick.<ref>\"Tectonic plates. Shifting Sands\". Roberts, Paul. Harvard University Press. http.www.harvard.edu\/roberts\/shifting. Retrieved 2009-07-28.<\/ref>\n\n== Tectonic plates ==\n<gallery>\n\n<\/gallery>\nThe Earth is the only terrestrial planet with active plate tectonics. Due to plate tectonics the Earth's crust basically floats on the thick liquid rock of the mantle below. The crust is split up into parts called plates. These plates interact as they move about causing earthquakes and creating volcanoes and mountain ranges. The place where plates meet are called plate boundaries. There are three types of plate boundary: constructive, destructive and transform.<ref>Toshiro Tanimoto. \"Crustal of the Earth\". American Geophysical Union. Retrieved 2009-08-02.<\/ref>\n\n== Surface ==\n\nThe Earth changes greatly from place to place. Over 70% of the Earth surface is covered by water. The underwater surface has many of the same features as the above sea with volcanoes, mountains and trenches or canyons. The 30% not covered by water is mostly forests, deserts plains, mountains and plateaus. Human civilization has led to increasing urbanisation \u2014 the growth of cities. Many things can change the surface of the Earth. Plate tectonics is main cause of change but there are others such as erosion from wind and rain, erosion by the oceans or meteorite impacts. There are three main types of rock that make up the Earth's surface: Igneous rock is made when magma or lava from the mantle reaches the surface and cools. As it gets colder it turns into rock or solidifies. Sedimentary rock is made from sediment, like sand or small bits of other rock, that has been crushed and packed tightly together. Metamorphic rock which is made when either of the other two types are changed by high or low temperatures and pressures.<ref>\"The Crust\". Alphonz, Edgar. Oregon State University. http.www.osu.edu\/Alphonz\/Crust. Retrieved 2009-07-03.<\/ref>\n\n== Atmosphere ==\n\nA planet's atmosphere is a layer of different gases surrounding it. It is kept there by gravity. The Earth's atmosphere is made of about 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and small amounts of other gases. This mixture is often called air. Further up there is a layer of ozone gas called the Ozone layer. Ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. Ultraviolet radiation is dangerous to people, so without the Ozone layer life would not be possible. The atmosphere also protects the earth from crashes with meteors and small asteroids. This is because they burn up due to all the friction as they fly through it. It also helps to keep Earth warm. Some gases including carbon dioxide and methane act like a blanket around the Earth, they trap heat under them, keeping the Earth warm.<ref>\"NASA - Earth's atmosphere\". NASA Student Guides. http.www.nasa.gov\/student\/atmosphere. Retrieved 2009-08-06.<\/ref>\n\n== Weather, climate, and water cycle ==\n\nHot air rises. As it rises it gets colder again and falls. This creates convection currents. When hot air meets cold air different weather effects happen. Convection currents are the cause of almost all weather on Earth. When it gets hot on the surface water evaporates and becomes steam or water vapour. This hot water vapour rises. As it rises it gets colder. When it gets cold enough it turns back into water again. This causes the clouds and rain. It is called the water cycle.<ref>\"What causes weather?\". NASA Student Guides. http.www.nasa.gov\/student\/weather. Retrieved 2009-08-06<\/ref>\n\n== Orbit and rotation ==\n\nThe Earth takes about 24 hours to complete one day and about 365 days to complete a year. Actually, the Earth take 365.24 days to revolve around the sun. After every four years, an extra day is added, and the year has 366 days. This is a leap year. The Earth is, on average, 150 million kilometers away from the Sun, and moving at a speed of 30 kilometers a second or 108,000 miles an hour. The Moon orbits the Earth at an average distance of 250,000 miles. It is tidally locked to Earth, which means it always has the same side facing the Earth. It takes roughly one month to complete one orbit. The Earth is part of the Solar System and orbits the sun along with thousands of small objects and eight planets. The Sun, and therefore the Solar System, are currently traveling through the Orion Arm of the Milky Way Galaxy and will be for approximately the next 10,000 years.<ref>\"Earth's in the Milky Way\".

In 1864, Inuit hunters shot and killed an enormous yellow-furred bear and gave the skin and skull to the [[Anderson River (Northwest Territories)|Fort Anderson]] post manager and amateur naturalist [[Roderick MacFarlane]] (sometimes given as Robert MacFarlane) of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]].<ref name\"curlew\">[http:\/\/www.npwrc.usgs.gov\/resource\/birds\/curlew\/search.htm Two Nest Searches for the Eskimo Curlew -- A Century Apart]<\/ref><ref>[http:\/\/www.irc.inuvialuit.com\/publications\/pdf\/Inuvialuit%20Smithsonian%20Report.pdf The Inuvialuit Smithsonian Project: Winter 2009-Spring 2011]<\/ref><ref>[http:\/\/www.inuvialuitlivinghistory.ca\/wiki_pages\/Roderick%20MacFarlane Roderick MacFarlane] at Inuvialuit Living History<\/ref><ref name=\"myst\"\/> MacFarlane shipped the skin and skull to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] where they were placed in storage and soon forgotten. Eventually, Dr. [[Clinton Hart Merriam]] uncovered the remains, which he thought{{clarification needed|date=June 2013}} had been shot very far outside the [[brown bear]]'s normal range, and concluded that it wasn't a brown bear at all. In 1918, he described the specimen as a new species and [[genus]], ''Vetularctos inopinatus'', calling it the \"ancient unexpected bear.\"<ref name=\"myst\">[http:\/\/www.strangeark.com\/bfr\/historical\/bille-mystery-bears.html Mystery Bears.] Reprinted with permission from Rumors of Existence, Matthew A. Bille at Strange Ark. Retrieved on February 5, 2008<\/ref>\n\nWith the exception of unconfirmed sightings, MacFarlane's bear is sometimes thought to have become [[extinct]] since the specimen was obtained in 1864. There have been many theories concerning the origin of MacFarlane's bear, which include suggestions that it may have been a [[grizzly\u2013polar bear hybrid]], or even a surviving representative of a [[Pleistocene]] species.<ref name=\"Shuker97\">[[Karl Shuker]]. ''From Flying Toads To Snakes With Wings.'' Llewellyn: St Paul (1997). ISBN 1-56718-673-4<\/ref>\n\nToday, it is known that grizzly-polar bear hybrids do occur on occasion and that they match the specimen's description very well, notably the pale tan fur, and apparently also the oddly shaped skull which led Merriam to propose his new genus. While this seems to be a satisfying explanation, it was not tested thoroughly because the hybridization theory was for long just a hypothesis. Now that more than circumstantial data from such hybrids exists, [[ancient DNA]] analysis and\/or a [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] study of the skull may well resolve the case of McFarlane's specimen. If it turns out to be a hybrid the scientific names ''Vetularctos'' and ''Ursus inopinatus'' would become invalid under the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]].\n\nIn episode #215 of the History Channel program ''[[Monster Quest]]'', \"Giant Bear Attack\", paleontologist Dr. Blaine W. Schubert (of East Tennessee State University) was allowed to examine the skull (although the Institute did not allow the examination to be filmed). Schubert stated that he was \"100% sure\" that it was the skull of a young, female brown bear and \"actually, not a particularly large individual.\"\n\nIn a 1984 publication intended to correct [[Clinton Hart Merriam|Merriam]]'s 1929 taxonomy proposing 96 distinct species names for varieties of brown bear,<ref>[[E.

I believe that the reviewer, while not needing to err on the side of passing, has an obligation to help with the last little fixes that may be necessary before an article is listed as a GA. This need not, however, involve the reviewer editing the article personally. Only articles that are patently terrible should be failed without a process to improve them, and given that I believe most editors listing things at GAN know what they're doing, failures should be very rare. This is not to say that editors should nominate articles before they believe them to be ready, meaning to use the intervening time between nomination and review to \"get the article there,\" only that if an article is, to pick a somewhat random number, 85% of the way there, that the reviewer should point out its faults so that it makes it to 100% and not just fail it.","timestamp":"20160410101113","user-timestamp":"20150410101113"},{"title":"Boghe\u0219ti","content":"{{Infobox settlement\n|name=Boghe\u015fti\n|settlement_type=[[Communes of Romania|Commune]]\n|total_type=&nbsp;\n|image_map=\n|map_caption=\n|coordinates_region=RO\n|subdivision_type=Country\n|subdivision_name={{flag|Romania}}\n|subdivision_type1=[[Counties of Romania|County]]\n|subdivision_name1=[[Vrancea County]]\n|population_total=1835\n|population_as_of=2002\n|population_footnotes=<ref>[\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20120921174727\/http:\/\/recensamant.referinte.transindex.ro\/?pg=3&id=2793 Romanian census data, 2002] Retrieved on April 7, 2016.<\/ref>\n|latd=46|latm=10|lats=|latNS=N|longd=27|longm=24|longs=|longEW=E\n|pushpin_map=Romania\n|timezone=[[Eastern European Time|EET]]|utc_offset=+2\n|timezone_DST=[[Eastern European Summer Time|EEST]]|utc_offset_DST=+3\n}}\n'''Boghe\u015fti''' is a [[Commune in Romania|commune]] located in [[Vrancea County]], [[Romania]].

His HM Plant Honda teammate [[Josh Brookes]] finished as runner-up, taking five victories as he finished 24 points behind Kiyonari. [[Tommy Hill]] finished third, having tailed off from a positive start to the season, having finished each of the first six races in the top three placings.

[[Michael Laverty]] finished fourth in the championship with two wins, with the Ducati of [[Michael Rutter (motorcycle racer)|Michael Rutter]] \u2013 another double race-winner \u2013 finishing in between Laverty and his teammate [[Alastair Seeley]], who took a single victory at Brands Hatch.

Steve Brogan, riding a BMW for Jentin Racing and [[Hudson Kennaugh]], riding a Kawasaki for Malcolm Ashley Racing and an Aprilia for Splitlath Motorsport, duked it out for class glory. By season's end, just three points separated the two riders, with Brogan finishing as victor, winning the class on twelve occasions. Kennaugh won seven, including the best result for an Evo rider, finishing in ninth place in the second race of the first Oulton Park meeting.

Qualifying was altered, with the \"Roll for Pole\" only setting the grid for race one of each weekend. This was due to the race two grid being set by the fastest laps of each rider in race one. Also introduced was a \"second chance\" system if a rider crashes on lap one, that rider only dropped eight places from where they started the first race. At the triple-race meetings, the same rules applied for race two, but were also applied for race three.<ref name=\"2010 rule changes\">{{cite news | url = http:\/\/britishsuperbike.com\/news\/bsb-set-to-intensify-in-2010-with-new-rule-changes.aspx | title = BSB set to intensify in 2010 with new rule changes | work = [[British Superbike Championship]] | publisher = [[MotorSport Vision]] | date = 2010-02-03 | accessdate =  2010-02-03}}<\/ref>\n\n===Championship restructure===\nPerhaps the biggest rule change was the dividing of the championship into two parts. The first nine meetings, totalling nineteen races, formed the \"Main Season\" of the championship, before the final three meetings, the remaining seven races, make up \"The Showdown\". The championship change was introduced after [[Leon Camier]] clinched the [[2009 British Superbike Championship season|2009 title]] with four races to spare, thus introducing a crescendo of competition.<ref name=\"2010 rule changes\"\/>\n\nThe normal FIM point-scoring system still applied, with 25 for the winner all the way down to a single point for fifteenth place. At the end of the Main Season, all riders dropped their two worst scores, which had to be from events they qualified for. From this points order, the first six riders in the championship standings were elevated to a new base level and became the Title Fighters for the final three events and seven races of the championship.<ref name=\"2010 rule changes\"\/>\n\nThe six-rider format was based on the [[Chase for the Sprint Cup#Seeding and scoring|2007-10 NASCAR Chase format]] of rewarding wins with bonus points for the playoff.  Unlike the Chase, where only wins awarded bonus points, '''any''' top-three finish in the Main Season were awarded bonus points, referred as Podium Credits. A win was worth three bonus points, second place was worth two bonus points, and third place was worth one bonus point. Each Title Fighter started The Showdown with 500 points and bonus points earned for each podium finish.<ref name=\"2010 rule changes\"\/> The standard points scoring format from the Main Season then continued for The Showdown, with all points scores from the final seven races counting.<ref name=\"2010 rule changes\"\/> All riders outside of the Title Fighters continued to race for the BSB Riders' Cup, continuing to add to their points total from the end of the Main Season. This also applied to the new Evolution class.<ref name=\"2010 rule changes\"\/>\n\n===Qualifying changes===\nThe Swan Combi Roll for Pole remained, but set the grid for Race 1 only. All riders take to the track for Q1 over 20 minutes. The field was then whittled down to 20 riders in Q2 over 12 minutes, and then the final 8 minutes shoot-out for pole position by the top 10 riders in Q3.

These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage\/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.\n\nUnfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Yaadein. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Yaadein~enwiki that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]]. If you think you might own all of the accounts with this name and this message is in error, please visit [[Special:MergeAccount]] to check and attach all of your accounts to prevent them from being renamed.\n\nYour account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.\n\nSorry for the inconvenience.\n\nYours,<br \/>[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]<br \/>Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation\n<\/div> 03:58, 20 March 2015 (UTC)\n<!-- SUL finalisation notification -->\n\n== Renamed ==\n\n<div class=\"plainlinks mw-content-ltr\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\u201d>\nThis account has been renamed as part of [[m:Special:MyLanguage\/Single User Login finalisation announcement|single-user login finalisation]].

Thanks. --[[User:Randykitty|Randykitty]] ([[User talk:Randykitty|talk]]) 08:47, 7 March 2016 (UTC)\n:::*'''Comment''' Thanks for your comment. you are again wrong at one point, none of the more than 15 citations that i have added today is being edited and authored by Mr Jha on whom this article is based. They are all third party citations of journals and anthologies edited and authored by someone else editors and authors. Those journals and anthologies published his pieces after selecting and reviewing them from number of submissions. These are review and criticism in itself. on your one point i can agree to some extent that it may need some citations which may be criticism and reviews on his creative works. That can be done, not a big thing. Such reviews and articles of him are available in the print version of books and journals that will be added soon after verification. Thanks again.[[User:Prinshukr|Prinshukr]] ([[User talk:Prinshukr|talk]]) 12:52, 7 March 2016 (UTC)\n::::*Have a look at [[WP:ACADEMIC]]. Academics are judged by their publications that on top of any editorial selection are [[peer-reviewed]] by usually several peers. Yet, no academic is judged notable just because they have published a number of papers. What counts is whether anybody ''noted'' those papers by citing them in their own work or including them in a literature review. For authors, what we use are book reviews in reputable sources (so reviews on Amazon or someone's blog don't count). Just publishing something does not make an author notable. --[[User:Randykitty|Randykitty]] ([[User talk:Randykitty|talk]]) 13:34, 7 March 2016 (UTC)\n:::::* thanks again. I agree with this points.

That doesn't show it might not be important in India (India has no union catalog or other way of finding this sort of information) , but it does show it isn't important elsewhere. The other books listed for him in WorldCat are similar--the most widely held is ''The novels of Amitav Ghosh : an analytical appraisal'' in 17 libraries. WP:PROF is normally interpreted on an international scale, but inn the humanities, there can be considerable national interest in work that is on national subjects, and this can be notable also. I don't really see any way of telling this--there is not only no citation indexes for India, but  index of any sort to publications from India in the field of humanities.  \n:However, possibly it might meet   WP:AUTHOR.  For authors of poetry (as for short stories)  publication of their works as complete books is not essential, and publication in multiple major  anthologies has usually been accepted here. The ones currently listed as publishing his work  do not impress me as likely to be major anthologies.  \n:Of course, this is part  of a campaign for self-advertising, and could probably be deleted as such. The contributor does not seem to realize that the purpose of WP is not to help anyone's career--doing that would be promotional, and WP is not a medium for promotion. The purpose of WP is to have information that ordinary readers who might have encountered the subject might want to know. If the person has been covered by major reviews or appears in major anthologies or is a best-seller in a documented way, people might reasonable come to an encyclopedia to find   information. If the work is less well-known than that, they are not likely to come, and an article is inappropriate. (And that's the point of the notability guidelines).

The article under discussion was accepted for publication on 06 Jan 2015. Since then and till 04 Mar 16, not a single question is raised against this article. On 04 Mar 16 one editor recommend it to speedy deletion as he was not happy and contended with my other three articles [[Authorspress]], [[Phenomenal Literature]] & [[VerbalArt]].  I contested this speedy deletion and one admin declined its speedy deletion. Again same editor who recommended its speedy deletion, mobilize [[AfD]]. My question is that if this article was so much full of flaw and fallacies why anyone could not pay attention for one and more than year. Is article accepted for publication without any scrutiny? Is the speedy deletion is declined without any reason and investigation? Still I have tried utmost to address the grievances raised by the nominating and other editors. \n\n:Now coming to our next article [[Authorspress]], same editor recommended this article for speedy deletion and on contesting the deletion, the speedy deletion declined by another admin\/editor. Now who declined its speedy deletion and has now started [[AfD]] against this article. Don\u2019t you think all these make the things something contraries? I appreciate this debate because it teaches many things to a new editor but what I observed is that if such debate is started on every article of Wikipedia, half of total articles created even by experience editors need to be deleted. It seems that we are peeling a piece of hair.  I agree that I have written four articles of which three are co-related and one on different theme. I also agree that my two articles [[VerbalArt]] & [[Phenomenal Literature]] should not have been written but written in passion as a new editor. These also have a scope and can be merged with the article, [[Vivekanand Jha]].  \n\n:But I still strongly believe that articles [[Vivekanand Jha]] & [[Authorspress]] deserve to be on Wikipedia and this I am telling after going through a host of article available on authors and publishing houses on Wikipedia. While writing so many things I do understand the purpose of Wikipedia and every day and moment I turn for it to clear a cloud of any doubts. I do understand that it is not a platform for cataloging, promotion and advertising, like social networking sites and it needs a lot of patience, knowledge and hard work to remain riveted here.\n\n:I got some co-operation too. But, so far, especially in a month,  more than getting co-operation from experienced editors, I am sorry to say, I suffered a bite, witch hunt, aggression and vandalism which is also against the policy of Wikipedia. If we need to observe all other policies of Wikipedia we need to follow this policy as well. Sorry for trespassing!

The [[Leaf|leaves]] are pleated in the upper part and deciduous. The pseudobulbs become spiny after the leaves have dropped.\n\nThe [[inflorescence]] is borne on the basis. It consists of very fleshy [[flower]]s that are unisexual, which is exceptional for orchids. The colorful male and yellowish-green female flowers are typically situated on different plants.  Which type of flower a plant produces is determined by the conditions under which it grows.\n\nThere are rare cases in which a single plant in intermediate conditions will produce both male and female flowers.  These flowers are markedly different in size and color.

Species of this genus all host wood devouring mycorhizzial fungi which supplement the plants' nutrition by breaking down decomposing wood.  Most of these species have a prolonged saprophytic stage in decomposing wood as seedlings before developing leaves and photosynthesis.  Fungi which break down wood require a [[Nitrogen]] source since wood is primarily composed solely of hemi-cellulose, cellulose, and lignin and lacks nitrogen, and these plants are heavy feeders with high nitrogen requirements typically.\n\nMany of these species are known to germinate in ant nests high in the canopy and host ant colonies, which provide the plants with an abundant supply of nitrogen, and they also host ants in cultivation frequently.<ref>The Orchids, Natural History and Classification, Robert L. Dressler.  ISBN 0-674-87526-5<\/ref>  Most of these species are considered moderately difficult to maintain in cultivation without a greenhouse or wardian case and some of them defy cultivation.  Most of them cannot tolerate dryness and some of them have very specific temperature requirements.

The castle was plundered in 1257, and underwent a reconstruction but it was burned down in around 1293-4 and likely never rebuilt.<ref name=\"rc\">{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.coflein.gov.uk\/en\/site\/94553\/details\/LLANGYNWYD+CASTLE\/|title=Llangynwyd Castle|publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales|accessdate=5 April 2016}}<\/ref>\n\n==Structure==\nThe [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales]] describes the ruined castle as occupying the \"tip of a steep sided spur between two streams\", and consisting of a \"heart shaped walled inner court some 35-37m across set at the south-east end of a larger outer court\". \nThe twin-towered gatehouse overlooking the outer court was said to resemble that of the great gatehouse at [[Caerphilly Castle]]. It is believed to date to the time of the rebuilding in the 1260s.<ref name=\"rc\"\/>\n\nThe inner court is surrounded by a deep ditch, except on the northeastern side. The curtain wall around it is in a poorly degraded state, and possibly predates 1257.<ref name=\"rc\"\/> Several of the building foundations can still be seen in the interior.

We made our own fire-crackers for Easter, and we flew our kites which were made form paper, water and flour. When we rode our bikes, if we happened to have one, we wore no helmets, just flip-flops and shorts in the middle of the winter. As children, we would ride in cars with no seat belts or airbags. Riding in the passenger seat was a treat.\n\n\nWe drank water from the garden hose, not from a bottle and it tasted so good. We did not have the worry of dandruff shampoo, dry hair or greasy hair shampoo, thanks to the all- purpose green soap.\n\n\nWe ate chips as the main meal, bread and butter and drank fizzy juice with sugar in it, but we were never overweight because we were always outside playing. We shared one drink with four friends, from one bottle, and no one actually died from this.\n\n\nWe would spend hours building toys out of scraps, which were so much appreciated. We would leave home in the morning and could play all day, as long as we were back before it got dark. No one was able to reach us and no one minded.  We did not have Play stations or X-Boxes, no video games at all. No 99 channels on TV, no videotape movies, no surround sound, no mobile phones, no personal computers, no DVDs, no Internet chat rooms. We had REAL FRIENDS - we went outside and found them.  We played with sticks and stones, and we would go to a patisserie waiting for our luck to strike for some well-off friend to come and buy us a sweet.\n \n\nWe swam all the way to the anchored boats, and sometimes all the way to the visiting ships. We would dive in shallow water no deeper than 40 cm. We fell off trees, got cut and broke bones but there were no lawsuits. We had full on fistfights but no prosecution followed from other parents. We played chap-the-door-run-away and were actually afraid of the owners catching us. We walked to friends' homes. We also, believe it or not, WALKED to school. We didn't rely on mummy or daddy to drive us to school, which was not exactly round the corner.\n\n\nThe idea of a parent bailing us out if we broke the law was unheard of. They actually sided with the law. This generation has produced some of the best risk-takers and problem-solvers. The past 50 years have been an explosion of innovation and new\nideas. We had freedom, failure, success and responsibility, and we learned how to deal with it all.\n \n\nYou must know lots of people who have had the luck to grow as real kids, before lawyers and government regulated our lives, for our own good!!!! The majority of us now are one step away from our retirement\u2026. the sunset of our lifetime, but we are all what they called \u2018youth\u2019.\n\n\nYouth now may have never heard of the Rolling Stones, they probably never heard Twist and Shout or watched [[Jerry Lewis]], [[Norman Wisdom]] or [[Thanasis Veggos]]. For them, there has always been only half Cyprus; AIDS and CDs have existed since they were born. Michael Jackson has always been white. They can never imagine life before computers. They'll never have pretended to be the 'A' Team. They can't believe a black and white television ever existed. And they will never understand how we could leave the house without a mobile phone. But despite the odds, we are here breathing and screwing.\n\n Now let's check if you are getting old:\n\n1. You understand what was written above and you smiled.\n\n2. You need to sleep more, usually until the afternoon, after a night out.\n\n3. Your friends are grandparents.\n\n4. You are always surprised to see small children playing comfortably with computers.\n\n5. When you see teenagers with mobile phones, you shake your head.\n\n6. You meet your friends from time to time, talking about the good old days, repeating again all the funny things you have experienced together.\n\n7. Having read this you are thinking of sending it to some other friends because you think they will like it too... Yes, you're getting OLD!\n \n \n==Pearls of wisdom==\n\nLife has two doors. I opened one and entered. I looked around in the morning. And by the afternoon, I got out of the other (Greek song).\n\n\nI am a weak, temporary creature, made from mud and dreams. But inside me I feel all the powers of the universe. I want, just for a moment before these crush me, to open my eyes and see them. I have no other aim in my life (Nikos Kazantzakis). \n\n\n\nEverything is in vain (\u038c\u03bb\u03b1 \u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03b1)\nStreet slang by shopkeepers in Hermes Street, Larnaka 1970's\n\n\n== My Epitaph ==\n\nI came.

Recently promoted articles can't be brought to FAR, and even if you waited six months to bring it to FAR, a FAR over one image would likely be dismissed as an inappropriate use of FAR.  Every image reviewer who reviews FACs comes to different conclusions: the nominator switched the images initially objected to and no one objected.  Discussion on the article talk page, or wherever images are discussed and image people actually come to consensus is indicated.  That's the best we can do unless more editors are willing to review images, and in the absence of concurrence among the different reviewers.

[[OCLC]] helped push libraries towards acquiring digital resources by providing a centralized technology resource for participating libraries.<ref>Malinconico, S. Michael: \"[[Digital Preservation]] Technologies and Hybrid Libraries,\" ''[[Information Services and Use]]'', 159(74): 173, 2002<\/ref> Now, with the widespread availability of digital content, it includes [[Internet]] resources and documents which are online, such as [[eprint]]s.\n\nHybrid libraries are the new norm for many [[archivist]]s as well.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} [[Digitization]] has changed the way archivists have gone about preserving historical items. Archivists are now using digital technology to preserve items that were once only preserved by things like [[microfiche]]. Archivists now use things like [[digital imaging]] which make it possible for researchers to see historical items online.<ref>Malinconico, S. Michael: \"Digital Preservation Technologies and Hybrid Libraries,\" ''Information Services and Use'', 159(74): 162, 2002<\/ref>\n\nThe emergence of the hybrid library has put a new emphasis on [[copyright]] issues for many libraries. The complicated and changing copyright laws in both the [[United States]] and the [[European Union]] have made it a challenge for many libraries to make sure their patrons are using the digital items lawfully.<ref>Oppenheim, Charles: \"Copyright Issues in Digitisation and the Hybrid Library,\" ''Information Services and Use'', 203(7): 204.{{when|date=August 2010}}<\/ref>\n\nHybrid libraries need staff that are trained in helping patrons navigate the vast amount of information available in the digital age. Librarians working in hybrid libraries have training in electronic media as well as the traditional print forms.\n\n==Issues in hybrid library==\n\nSome of the issues facing the hybrid libraries are the [[digital divide]], [[interoperability]], [[collection development]], ownership of electronic resources and preservation of digital media.\n\nAny advancement in information technology will be useful only when you know how to use it.The term [[digital divide]] is used to describe the gap between those with information technology knowledge and those who do not.<ref>Choemprayong, S.: ''Closing Digital Divides: The United States' Policies'', 2006.{{where|date=August 2010}}<\/ref>\n\nMajority of the libraries these days are hybrid libraries. The libraries own and subscribe to different resources in different formats. Some of the common formats are [[ejournal]]s, serials, print monographs, [[CD]] and [[DVD]]. The main components of digital library framework are user interfaces, repository, handle system, and search system.<ref>Arms, W. Y., Blanchi, C., & Overly, E. A.: \"An Architecture for Information in Digital Libraries\". ''D-Lib Magazine'', February 1997.<\/ref> The handle system and search system are the major components that should be designed with interoperability features to search across different repositories owned by different vendors. The user interface should be designed in a generic way that it helps library patrons develop a common knowledge to do advanced searches across all repositories.\n\n==Collection development==\n\n[[Collection development]] is another challenge facing the hybrid libraries. The process of collection management in a hybrid library is similar to that of a traditional library. Hybrid libraries follow the same policies and procedures followed in traditional library collection development.<ref name=\"chowdhury\">Chowdhury, G. & Chowdhury, S.: ''Introduction to Digital Libraries''. London: Facet Publication, 2003. \n<\/ref>\n\n==Ownership of electronic resources==\n\nOwnership of electronic resources is another issue facing the hybrid libraries. Ownership of electronic materials is virtual and not physical. There are no clear policies about the ownership of electronic materials once the subscription is cancelled or expired. Libraries have to pay attention to the legal contracts from the database vendors. If the libraries plan on archiving the electronic resources, then there are legal issues related to it. The most prominent legal issues are intellectual property and authenticity of digital information.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\n==Preservation of digital media==\n\nWith any new advanced technology related to digital information storage, the main question to be answered is its durability. Digital storage media like disc or tapes deteriorate over time. The main question related to digital preservation is what and how much should be preserved. To make the preservation of digital media cost effective, standardization of different media format is required.

The most familiar of his many contributions in the field of economics were his statement of [[consumer theory|consumer demand theory]] in [[microeconomics]], and the [[IS\/LM model]] (1937), which summarised a [[Keynesian]] view of [[macroeconomics]].  His book ''[[Value and Capital]]'' (1939) significantly extended [[general equilibrium theory|general-equilibrium]] and value theory.  The [[compensated demand function]] is named the Hicksian demand function in memory of him.\n\nIn 1972 he received the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] (jointly)  for his pioneering contributions to [[general equilibrium theory]] and [[welfare economics|welfare theory]].<ref>[http:\/\/nobelprize.org\/nobel_prizes\/economics\/laureates\/1972\/index.html The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1972].

His father was a journalist at a local newspaper.\n\nHe was educated at [[Clifton College]] (1917\u201322) and at [[Balliol College, Oxford]] (1922\u201326), financed by mathematical scholarships. During his school days, and in his first year at Oxford, he specialised in mathematics  but also had interests in literature and history. In 1923, he moved to [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]], the \"new school\" just being started at Oxford, graduating with [[British undergraduate degree classification|second-class honors]] and, so he states, \"no adequate qualification in any of the subjects\" that he had studied.<ref>[http:\/\/nobelprize.org\/nobel_prizes\/economics\/laureates\/1972\/hicks-autobio.html John R.

Hick's influences included [[Lionel Robbins]] and such associates as [[Friedrich von Hayek]], [[R.G.D. Allen]], [[Nicholas Kaldor]], and [[Abba Lerner]] \u2013 and [[Lady Ursula Hicks|Ursula Webb]], who, in 1935, became his wife.\n\nFrom 1935 to 1938, he lectured at [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] where he was also a fellow of [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Gonville & Caius College]]. He was mainly occupied in writing ''Value and Capital'', which was based on the work he had done in London. From 1938 to 1946, he was Professor at the [[University of Manchester]]. It was there that he did his main work on welfare economics, with its application to social accounting.\n\nIn 1946 he returned to [[Oxford University|Oxford]], first as a research fellow of [[Nuffield College, Oxford|Nuffield College]] (1946\u201352), then as [[Drummond Professor of Political Economy]] (1952\u201365), and finally as a research fellow of [[All Souls College]] (1965\u201371) where he continued writing after retirement. He was also an honorary fellow of [[Linacre College]].  He died in 1989.\n\nHicks was knighted in 1964 and was co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences (with [[Kenneth J. Arrow]]) in 1972. He donated the Nobel Prize to the [[London School of Economics|London School of Economics and Political Science]]'s Library Appeal in 1973.<ref name='lse'\/>\n\n==Contributions to economic analysis==\nHicks's early work as a [[labour economics|labour economist]] culminated in ''[[The Theory of Wages]]'' (1932, 2nd ed. 1963), still considered standard in the field.  He collaborated with R.G.D. Allen in two seminal papers on [[value theory]] published in 1934.\n\nHis [[magnum opus]] is ''[[Value and Capital]]'' published in 1939.  The book ''built'' on [[ordinal utility]]  and mainstreamed the now-standard distinction between the [[substitution effect]] and the [[income effect]] for an individual in [[Consumer theory|demand theory]] for the 2-good case. It generalised the analysis to the case of one good and a [[composite good]], that is, all other goods. It aggregated individuals and businesses through demand and supply across the economy. It anticipated the [[aggregation problem]], most acutely for the stock of capital goods. It introduced [[general equilibrium theory]] to an English-speaking audience, refined the theory for dynamic analysis, and for the first time attempted a rigorous statement of stability conditions for general equilibrium.  In the course of analysis Hicks formalised [[comparative statics]].  In the same year, he also developed the famous \"compensation\" criterion called [[Kaldor\u2013Hicks efficiency]] for welfare comparisons of alternative public policies or economic states.\n\nHicks's most familiar contribution in [[macroeconomics]] was the [[IS\u2013LM model|Hicks\u2013Hansen IS\u2013LM model]],<ref>{{cite journal |first=J. R. |last=Hicks |year=1937 |title=Mr. Keynes and the 'Classics', A Suggested Interpretation |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=5 |issue=2 |jstor=1907242 |pages=147\u2013159 }}<\/ref> which formalised an interpretation of the theory of [[John Maynard Keynes]] (see [[Keynesianism]]). The model describes the economy as a balance between three commodities: money, consumption and investment. Hicks himself did not embrace the theory as he interpreted it; and, in a paper published in 1980, Hicks asserted that it had omitted some crucial components of Keynes's arguments, especially those related to [[uncertainty]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=J.

It is particularly associated with the town of [[Ligni\u00e8res, Cher|Ligni\u00e8res]] and neighbouring areas of the [[d\u00e9partement]]s of [[Cher (department)|Cher]] and [[Indre]]. It is found mostly in those d\u00e9partements and in those of [[Ni\u00e8vre]] and [[Allier]], but is distributed through much of central and northern France. It was in the past used both for in agricultural work, particularly in [[vineyard]]s, and for [[barge]] haulage on the canals of the area. The breed was recognised by the [[Minist\u00e8re de l'Agriculture (France)|Minist\u00e8re de l'Agriculture]], the French ministry of agriculture, in 1994. The [[stud book]] is kept by the breeders' association, the Association Fran\u00e7aise de l'\u00c2ne Grand Noir du Berry. \n \n== History ==\n\nThe origins of the Grand Noir du Berry are unknown. It has been variously suggested that it was influenced by imports of donkeys from [[Algeria]] in the 1850s,<ref name=assoc\/> or that it descends from [[Catalan donkey]]s brought to the area by itinerant [[Romani people]].<ref name=bataille\/> From the early twentieth century onwards there is ample documentation in photographs of its use in agriculture, in harness and for barge haulage.<ref name=assoc\/> A breeders' association, the Association Fran\u00e7aise de l'\u00c2ne Grand Noir du Berry, was formed in 1993 and in January 1994 the breed was officially recognised by the agriculture ministry and the [[Haras Nationaux]]. The association maintains the stud book for the breed.<ref name=assoc2\/>\n \nIn 1994 there were 100 animals registered in the stud book; the current population is about 1300.<ref name=haras\/>\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Grand noir du berry.jpg|thumb|280px|A Grand Noir du Berry donkey]]\nGrand Noir du Berry jacks measure {{convert|1.35|\u2013|1.45|m|in|abbr=out}}, and jennies a minimum of {{convert|1.30|m|in|abbr=on}} The coat is black, with or without ''[[pangar\u00e9]]'' markings. There is no [[dorsal stripe]], [[shoulder-stripe]] or [[zebra bars|zebra-striping]] of the legs. The lower part of the muzzle is pale grey, as is the belly.<ref name=haras\/>\n \n== Use ==\n\nThe Grand Noir du Berry was in the past used in agricultural work, particularly in vineyards, and for light agricultural draught work; from about 1850 it was also used to draw barges on the [[Canal de Berry]] and other canals of the region, work that had previously been done by men.<ref name=assoc\/> Today it may be used as a pack animal for hiking or trekking, or for recreational [[carriage driving|driving]];<ref name=haras\/> jacks may be used to sire [[mule]]s.<ref name=farissier\/>\n \n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=assoc>[http:\/\/www.afagnb.com\/le-grand-noir-du-berry\/historique\/ Historique] (in French).

In this station 14 super fast trains, 18 express trains and 6 passenger trains halt in this station \nin both directions.\n\n== History ==\n\nThis station was built during the period 1893\u20131896, supporting 1,287&nbsp;km (800&nbsp;mi) of railway tracks covering the coastal area from Cuttack to Vijayawada. It was built and opened to traffic by East Coast State Railway. Later in 1900s this was handed over to Bengal Nagpur Railway (BNR). When India became independent the station came under jurisdiction of [[South Eastern Railway zone|South Eastern Railway]]. After 2003, as per restricting of Indian railways zones, the station fell under jurisdiction of [[East Coast Railway zone|East Coast Railway]].\n\nThe Bengal Nagpur Railway was nationalised in 1944. The Eastern Railway was formed on 14 April 1952, with the portion of East Indian Railway Company east of Mughalsarai and the Bengal Nagpur Railway. In 1955, South Eastern Railway was carved out of Eastern Railway. It comprised lines mostly operated by BNR earlier. Among the new zones were East Coast Railway and South East Central Railway. Both these railways were carved out of South Eastern Railway\n\n\n== Amenities ==\n\nThis station has a First Class Waiting Hall, computerised reservation offices, II class waiting room, footbridge, and a Public Address System. A computerized reservation counter is available from 08:00Hrs to 20:00Hrs.\n\nThis station has 4 platforms.\n\n== Administration ==\n\nThis station is staffed by 1 station superintendent, 3 station masters, 10 traffic pointsmen, and 3 booking clerks.\nThe station superintendent is in overall charge of the station, and is responsible for all aspects of station maintenance, staff administration, and commercial statistics.\n\nThe station contains the office of a senior section engineer for the railway.

Majority of the believers in Novi Sad are from [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], while others are from Roman Catholic Church, many Protestant churches, and [[Jews and Judaism in Serbia|Jewish community]]. [[Stari Grad, Novi Sad|Stari Grad]] is the place with the majority of churches and temples, and they are all built in the 18th and 19th century.\n\nThe oldest religious building in the city was Orthodox church dedicated to [[John the Baptist|Saint John]]. This church was built in 1700, but was burned in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|1848\u201349 revolution]]. It was rebuilt in 1853, but was razed in 1921.\n\n==Orthodox churches==\nThe main Orthodox church in the City is [[The Orthodox Cathedral of Saint George]] (''[[Saborna Crkva]] svetog \u0110or\u0111a''), built in 1742, it is next to the Bishop\u2019s Palace, the seat of the Serbian Orthodox [[Eparchy of Ba\u010dka]]. In city centre there are also [[the Church of Holy Dormition (Novi Sad)|the Church of Holy Dormition]] (''Uspenska crkva''), built in 1736, [[Alma\u0161 Church]] (''Alma\u0161ka crkva'') in [[Alma\u0161ki Kraj]], built in 1797 and [[Russian Orthodox]] [[Church of St. Nicholas (Novi Sad)|Church of St. Nicholas]] (''Nikolajevska crkva''), built in 1730. There is also Church of Presentation (''Vavedenjska crkva'') in [[Petrovaradin]], as well as an Orthodox church in [[Sremska Kamenica]], built in 1737\u20131758.\n\nIn the 1990s, at end of the state socialist period in [[Serbia]], numerous new Serbian Orthodox churches were built in Novi Sad's neighbourhoods: in [[Klisa, Serbia|Klisa]], [[Telep]], [[Bistrica (Novo Naselje)|Novo Naselje]], [[Detelinara]], [[Petrovaradin]], [[Paragovo]], and [[Veternik]]. These new churches are all built in [[Neo-Byzantine architecture]], which is more [[Balkans|Balkanic]] architecture and very different from the older Orthodox churches in the city, which are of a more Central Europe-type architecture.\n\n[[Kovilj Monastery]] is the only Orthodox monastery in the municipal area of Novi Sad. It is located near the village of [[Kovilj]]. It was reconstructed in 1705\u201307 and according to the legend, the monastery was founded by the first Serb archbishop [[Saint Sava]] in the 13th century.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Almaska crkva.JPG|Alma\u0161 Church\nImage:Nikolajevska crkva.JPG|Church of St. Nicholas (''Nikolajevska crkva'')\nImage:Serbia-0304 - The Dormition of the Virgin Mary Church.jpg|Church of Holy Dormition (''Uspenska crkva'')\nImage:Telep02.jpg|New Orthodox church in [[Telep]], built in [[Neo-Byzantine architecture]]\nImage:Novo naselje crkva.JPG|New Orthodox church in [[Bistrica (Novo Naselje)|Novo Naselje]] (under construction)\nImage:Slana bara crkva brvnara.jpg|Wooden Orthodox church in Slana Bara\nImage:Slana bara orthodox church.JPG|Orthodox church in Slana Bara\nImage:Petrovaradin, \u00e9glise Saint-Paul Ap\u00f4tre.jpg|Orthodox church in [[Petrovaradin]]\nImage:SremskaKamenica 03.jpg|Orthodox church in [[Sremska Kamenica]]\nImage:Monast\u00e8re de Kovilj.jpg|[[Kovilj monastery]]\n<\/gallery>\n\n==Roman Catholic churches==\nAlthough Roman Catholic churches and worshippers are a minority in the city, for historical reasons, [[The Name of Mary Church]] (''Crkva imena Marijinog'') dominates city centre and it is one of the most recognised structures in Novi Sad. Built in [[Gothic Revival architecture]], in 1895 on the site of an older church, which was burnt down, it is the tallest temple in the [[Ba\u010dka]] region. There are also two more Roman Catholic churches in the city, one in [[Telep]] and one in [[Grbavica (Novi Sad)|Grbavica]] (in Futo\u0161ka street). There are also three Catholic churches in [[Petrovaradin]] and one in [[Sremska Kamenica]] (built in 1746), as well as a [[Franciscan]] monastery in Petrovaradin (1701\u20131714). [[Tekije Church]] in Petrovaradin, built in 1881, is used by all 3 Christian communities in the city: Orthodox, Protestant, and Catholic. There was also one [[Armenians|Armenian church]] dedicated to [[St. Gregory the Illuminator]], which was built in 1746, destroyed during bombardment in 1849, and then rebuild in 1872 with funds of Serbian philanthrope [[Marija Trandafil]]. This church was finally demolished in 1963 to make way for new boulevard.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Novi Sad crkva.JPG|[[The Name of Mary Church|The Name of Mary Catholic Church]]\nImage:Saint George church in Petrovaradin.JPG|Saint George church in Petrovaradin\nImage:Telep,_Catholic_Church.jpg|Saint Elizabeth Catholic Church in Telep\nImage:Petrovaradin,_The_Our_Lady_of_Snow_ecumenic_Church.jpg|The Our Lady of Snow ecumenic Church in Petrovaradin\n<\/gallery>\n\n==Protestant churches==\n[[Rotkvarija]] neighborhood is home to the [[Slovaks|Slovak]] [[Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Slovakia|evangelical]] church, built in 1886, conducting services predominantly in [[Slovak language]] (occasionally in [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[German language|German]]) and two [[Calvinism|Reformist]] churches, on in city Center, built in 1865, and another one in [[Telep]], both having services performed in [[Hungarian language]]. There are also many smaller temples of [[Baptists|Baptist]], [[Methodist]], [[Adventist]], [[Pentecostal]] and other Protestant communities. In most Protestant churches in Novi Sad, services are performed in Serbian language.

The channel now focuses entirely on music videos, with many Top 20 and Top 40 countdowns.\n[[File:VH-1.svg|150px|thumbnail|left|1st logo (October 10, 1994-1998).]]\n[[File:VH1 94-2003 logo.svg|150px|thumbnail|left|2nd logo (1998-2003).]]\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:VH1 logo.svg|150px|thumbnail|right|3rd logo (until October 1, 2013).]] -->\n\nBetween its UK launch and the late 1990s the channel played many 1980s videos including the present day at the time, while the logo was displayed in the top right hand corner with \"MUSIC FIRST\" displayed underneath it. The channel also at the time would dedicate particular days to an artist. Examples of these included \"[[The Jackson 5|Jacksons]] Day\", \"[[The Beautiful South|Beautiful South]] Day\" and \"[[Elton John]] Day\". A \"[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] Day\" in 1998 featured a full-length concert, alongside her music videos on the then daytime ''Upbeat'' programme.\n\nIn July 1998, the channel ran a \"[[Pop-Up Video|Pop Up Video]] Marathon\". Another feature which would run on the channel was ''Ten of the Best'', in which an artist's video is played and then the act themselves are on camera selecting their ten best videos, in which they would say why they like it along with the song with a description of the video that the viewer would be shown. After the show ended on VH1, the same idea was then transferred to VH2, in which alternative artists like [[Feeder]] and [[Athlete (band)|Athlete]] would choose the videos. The videos shown were usually bands like [[Pixies|The Pixies]], [[Elbow (band)|Elbow]] and [[Biffy Clyro]]. Despite VH2 later ceasing to exist, VH1 have not re-considered the concept.\n\n==Sister channels==\nTwo sister channels to VH1 have previously existed.\n\n*[[MTV Classic (UK & Ireland)|VH1 Classic]] (launched 1 July 1999; closed 1 March 2010) played all time greats from the 1960s to the 1990s. The channel was replaced by [[MTV Classic (UK & Ireland)|MTV Classic]].\n*[[VH2]] (launched 16 December 2003; closed 1 August 2006) showed mainly music videos and live concerts. It focused on [[Rock music|rock]], [[Independent music|indie]] and [[Punk rock|punk]] music and branded itself as \"the alternative to manufactured pop\". The channel was replaced by [[MTV Flux]], which itself was replaced by MTV +1.\n\n==See also==\n*[[VH1]]\n\n==External links==\n* [http:\/\/www.mtv.co.uk\/vh1 VH1 at MTV.co.uk]\n\n{{Viacom Media Networks}}\n{{MTV Networks Europe}}\n{{Viacom}}\n{{Music television in the United Kingdom}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vh1 (Uk and Ireland)}}\n[[Category:MTV channels in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Music video networks in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1994]]","timestamp":"20160410101302","user-timestamp":"20150410101302"},{"title":"User talk:U-bootwisky","content":"== July 2011 ==\n[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|30px|alt=|link=]] Please do not [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not a soapbox|use Wikipedia for promotion or advertising]], as you did at several articles by inserting references to books by a single author albeit these references are not being used in the article.

Deriving his power from his position as ''[[magister militum]]'' of the Western Empire, Ricimer exercised political control through a series of [[puppet monarch|puppet emperors]].\n\nRicimer's military office and his dominance over the empire led to historians such as [[J. B. Bury]] to conclude that he was a link between previous ''magistri militum'', such as the [[Vandals|Vandal]] [[Stilicho]], and the Germanic King of Italy, [[Odoacer]].<ref>J. B. Bury, ''History of the Later Roman Empire'' (London: Macmillan, 1889), vol. 1 p. 241<\/ref> Odoacer deposed Western Emperor [[Romulus Augustulus]] in 476, in an act often considered to mark the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of the Roman Empire]].\n\n==Lineage== \nRicimer was the son of [[Rechila]], the [[Suevi]]c [[King of Galicia]]. His mother was the daughter of [[Wallia]], King of the [[Visigoths]]. It has been surmised that such an alliance between the Suevi and the Visigoths would have been made before Wallia's death in 418, after which Wallia's successors may have become hostile toward the family members of the deceased king. As entry into the Western Empire's military was a frequently-used option for \"losers of struggles for leadership among the barbarians\",<ref>Gillett, [http:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/4436388 \"The Birth of Ricimer\", ''Historia: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Alte Geschichte''], '''44''' (1995), p. 382<\/ref> Ricimer's family would have thus entered the service of Rome.<ref>Sister: Herwig Wolfram, ''History of the Goths'', (1979) 1988:33, following Martindale, ''Prosopography'', 2:524f; daughter: Wolfram 1988:202.<!--please check against Martindale--><\/ref>  Ricimer's younger sister later married [[Gondioc]], the [[List of Kings of Burgundy|King]] of the [[Burgundians]].\n\n==Rise to power==\nAccording to [[Sidonius Apollinaris]], Ricimer served under the ''magister militum'' [[Flavius Aetius]] alongside the ''[[comes domesticorum]]'' [[Majorian]], whom he befriended.<ref>Sidonius, ''Carmen V'', 266-268; translated by W.B. Anderson, ''Sidonius: Poems and Letters'' (Harvard: Loeb Classical Library, 1980), vol. 1 p. 83<\/ref>\n\nA power vacuum was created in the Western Empire after the events of 454 and 455, which saw the consecutive murders of Aetius and of the Western Emperor [[Valentinian III]], who had been responsible for the ''magister militum's'' assassination. After the assassinations, the Roman Senator [[Petronius Maximus]] proclaimed himself emperor. Petronius, however, was killed by a Roman mob immediately prior to the Vandal sacking of the city in 455. After the sack, the Visigothic King [[Theodoric II]] proclaimed as Emperor [[Avitus]], the Roman military commander in [[Gaul]]. In return for Theodoric's support, Avitus agreed to allow the Visigoths to enter Suevi-controlled [[Hispania]]. Theodoric consented to Avitus's offers and the new emperor, with the Visigoths under his command, marched on Rome to secure the throne. Avitus named the Visigoth [[Remistus]] as ''magister militum'', a position which had been vacant since Aetius's death.\n\nFollowing the arrival of Avitus in Rome, Majorian gave his support, albeit reluctantly, to the new emperor. Avitus subsequently appointed Ricimer as a ''[[comes]]'', or count of the empire, a prominent military position. By this point, however, the Western Empire encompassed only the Italian Peninsula and portions of southern [[Gaul]], a mere fraction of the territory held by Rome in previous centuries.\n\nRicimer raised an army and navy from the [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] mercenaries available to him, and commenced campaigns directed against \"barbarian\" tribes in conflict with the empire. Ricimer achieved his first important victory in 456, when he defeated the Vandals in a naval battle. Although [[Priscus]] wrote that Avitus had sent him to Sicily to engage the Vandals, [[Hydatius]] states he defeated the Vandals near Corsica.<ref>Priscus, fragment 24; translated by C.D. Gordon, ''The Age of Attila: Fifth Century Byzantium and the Barbarians'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1966), p. 115. Bury, ''History of the Later Roman Empire'', vol. 1 p. 236<\/ref> After his Mediterranean victory, Ricimer was appointed by Avitus as ''magister militum praesentalis'', the commander of the Western Empire's field army in Italy and effectively the second-highest rank available to a general of the West.\n\nRicimer used his new position to assist his colleague Majorian in plotting against Avitus, who had not yet been recognized as Emperor of the West by [[Marcian]], the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Emperor]]. Ricimer and Majorian convinced the [[Roman Senate]] to authorize a military expedition against Avitus, who had established himself at the imperial capital of Ravenna. The two led an army against an imperial force commanded by the ''magister militum'' Remistus and defeated it at [[Piacenza]] on October 16, 456. They then besieged Avitus in Ravenna, which fell. Avitus was captured, forced to assume the [[bishop of Piacenza|bishopric of Piacenza]], and finally executed.<ref>[[John of Antioch (chronicler)|John of Antioch]], fragment 202; translated by C.D. Gordon, ''Age of Attila'', p. 116<\/ref> With the Western throne vacant, the new Eastern Emperor, [[Leo the Thracian|Leo I]], granted Ricimer the title of [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] and the rank of ''magister militum'' on February 28, 457. Leo appointed Majorian to replace Ricimer in his Italian command. Without a Western Emperor, Leo hoped to use Ricimer as his effective vicegerent in the West.\n\n==''Magister militum''==\n\n===Majorian (457\u2013461)===\n\nAs a Germanic tribesman, Ricimer could not assume the imperial throne himself, but as ''magister militum'' he gained influence over the Germanic peoples occupying Gaul, Hispania, and [[Northern Africa]]. He was left with the options of dissolving the Western Empire and ruling as an official viceroy of Leo in Constantinople or exerting his power over the West through a puppet emperor.  Though he had hoped to take the first option, the Roman aristocracy refused to consent to this step and Ricimer was forced to take the latter.\n\nWith a vacant Western throne, the [[Alamanni]] invaded Italy. They moved from [[Raetia]] and managed to penetrate Italy, reaching [[Lake Maggiore]]. Majorian led his field army north to fight the Alamanni, defeating them. Majorian was proclaimed emperor by his troops in a place called ''ad Columellas'' on April 1, 457.<ref>Sidonius, ''Carmina; Letters''. Translation: Anderson, W.B., ''Sidonius. Poems and Letters'', 2 vols. (Loeb, 1936\u20131965)<\/ref> Realizing Majorian's potential as a puppet, Ricimer induced Leo to give his consent to this arrangement.\n\nThough Ricimer had expected to control his friend, Majorian proved to be a capable ruler and soon distanced himself from his ''magister militum''. Majorian demonstrated his military skill through his re-conquest of Gaul and his campaigns in Hispania. Majorian's campaigns effectively subdued the Visigoths and returned them to their pre-Avitus ''[[foederati]]'' status, greatly increasing his standing among the senate and army. Majorian then prepared for a campaign against the [[Vandals]] of [[Geiseric]]. With Majorian in Hispania, Ricimer was left in Italy.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nMajorian was defeated by Geiseric, possibly through treachery, near modern-day [[Valencia]], Spain, while organizing a mercenary army. During his absence, Ricimer convinced the senate to turn against the emperor, who soon disbanded his army and returned to Italy. Learning that the emperor was in Tortona, Ricimer led a detachment there and arrested him. Deposing Majorian on August 3, 461, Ricimer had the emperor tortured and finally beheaded on August 7.<ref>Priscus, fragment 27, John of Antioch, fragment 203; both translated by C. D. Gordon, ''Age of Attila'', pp. 116f<\/ref>\n\n===Libius Severus (461\u2013465)===\nRicimer's murder of Majorian did not sit well with some portions of the military establishment, notably the commanding general in Gaul, [[Aegidius]], and the commanding general in Dalmatia, [[Marcellinus (magister militum)|Marcellinus]], who ruled their respective domains independent from imperial authority. These two generals entered open hostilities with Ricimer and refused to recognize Ricimer's position. Ricimer ruled the West without an emperor for three months. Facing pressure from the senate and Italian aristocracy, Ricimer named the undistinguished Senator [[Libius Severus]] as his puppet emperor. Though Severus was recognized by the senate, the Eastern Emperor Leo I refused to recognize him as his Western counterpart. Though he faced open military opposition from Western generals, with the docile Severus as emperor, Ricimer was master of Rome.\n\nThe chief problems facing Ricimer during Severus' \"reign\" was military opposition from the Vandals and political opposition from the Eastern Empire. The Vandals had continuously raided the Italian coast since the assassination of [[Valentinian III]] in 455, wreaking havoc upon the Italian economy. At the same time Eastern Emperor Leo refused to recognize Severus as the legitimate Western Emperor and refused to provide assistance to the Western government as a consequence. Constantinople had made peace with [[Geiseric]] in 462, but had refused to intervene in the Vandal raids. Due to diminished tax revenues and with the key armies of the West under opposition control, Ricimer needed assistance from the East in order to maintain order in the West. As such, Severus, despite his docile nature, represented an obstacle to Ricimer's power. Upon Severus' death in 465\u2014rumored, according to [[Cassiodorus]], to have been poisoned by Ricimer<ref>Cassiodrus, ''Chronicle'', 1280, quoted in Oost, [http:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/268600 \"D. N. Libivs Severvs P. F. AVGA\", ''Classical Philology''], '''65''' (1970), p. 229<\/ref>\u2014Ricimer proceeded to rule the West for eighteen months without an emperor as he waited for Leo to name Severus' successor.\n\n===Anthemius (467\u2013472)===\nThe Vandals saw the vacant Western throne as an opportunity to increase their role in imperial politics. Geiseric supported [[Olybrius]]' candidacy for appointment as emperor. Geiseric had family ties with Olybrius as both Olybrius and Geiseric's son [[Huneric]] had married the two daughters of [[Valentinian III]]. With Olybrius on the throne, Geiseric would become the real [[power behind the throne]] in the West, replacing Ricimer. To put Leo under pressure, the Vandals extended their attacks on Sicily and Italy to the territories of the Eastern Empire, sacking and enslaving people living in Illyricum, the Peloponnese and other parts of Greece.\n\nFaced with increased Vandal raiding, in 467 Leo named the commanding general of the Illyrian Army, [[Anthemius]], as Western Emperor. Leo sent Anthemius to Italy with an army led by the commanding general of the Dalmatian Army, [[Marcellinus (magister militum)|Marcellinus]], who had previously rebelled against Ricimer, to secure the Western throne and recapture North Africa from the Vandals.  Ricimer must have initially viewed Anthemius' appointment as undermining his position. Unlike [[Libius Severus]], Anthemius had a proven history of military success and had family ties to the [[Theodosian Dynasty]]. However, needing the support of the Eastern Empire, Ricimer was forced to accept him. To solidify his connections with the new emperor, Ricimer diplomatically married Anthemius' daughter [[Alypia (daughter of Anthemius)|Alypia]],<ref>[http:\/\/www.roman-emperors.org\/anthemiu.htm Ralph W. Mathisen, \"Anthemius (12 April 467 - 11 July 472 AD.)\"]<\/ref> and for some time lived in peace with Anthemius.\n\nSoon after assuming the Western throne, Anthemius granted Marcellinus the rank of [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] in an effort to counterbalance the authority of Ricimer. In the East, it was established practice for there to be two supreme commanders where in the West it had become common to only have one. With his experience with the Eastern military structure, this may have been an attempt by Anthemius to introduce the Eastern structure and rule like an Eastern Emperor using the successful and trustworthy Marcellinus as co-supreme commander with Ricimer. Both Eastern Emperor Leo and Anthemius had seen the difficulty any Western Emperor had in maintaining control over the Western military with the existence of a singular unchallenged supreme commander.\n\nIn 468, Eastern Emperor Leo organized a grand campaign attack against the Vandals in North Africa, in which the East and West would commit substantial forces. The commanding general of the Thracian Army [[Basiliscus]], brother-in-law of Leo, assumed supreme command over the joint West-East assault, with Marcellinus given direct command of the forces from the West. The overall plan called for a three-pronged attack between Basiliscus, Marcellinus, and the [[comes|Military Count of Egypt]] [[Heraclius of Edessa]].<ref name=\"Hussey 1967, p. 426\">Hussey (1967), p. 426<\/ref> Basiliscus was to land at a distance from [[Carthage]] with the main army (transported by an armada of over 1,000 ships) and then link up with Heraclius, advancing from [[Tripolitania]]. Marcellinus was to secure [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]] and then advance to Carthage.<ref name=\"Hussey 1967, p. 426\"\/><ref>Stephen Williams and Gerard Friell, ''The Rome That Did Not Fall: Survival of the East in the fifth century'', pp 178<\/ref> Ricimer, under the overall command of Marcellinus, commanded a large portion of the Western forces in the expedition. Ricimer's behavior raised suspicions that he secretly wanted the expedition to fail, which it ultimately did following the disastrous [[battle of Cape Bon (468)|battle of Cape Bon]]. Most of the joint armada was destroyed, with Marcellinus himself being assassinated by his own soldiers while in Sicily, perhaps at the instigation of Ricimer.\n\nThe failed joint expedition against the Vandals bankrupted the Western and Eastern Empires and greatly reduced their military might. Upon hearing of the disastrous defeat, the Visigoths resumed their wars of expansion against the West and the Vandals resumed raids on Italy. Additionally, with Marcellinus dead, Ricimer was left as the sole Supreme Commander of the West. Marcellinus had been Anthemius' favorite of the two generals, and his death served to widen the divide between the emperor and Ricimer. The tipping point of their relationship was the trial of [[Romanus (usurper)|Romanus]], the imperial chancellor (''[[magister officiorum]]'') and supporter of Ricimer, whom Anthemius accused of treachery and condemned to death in 470.<ref>[[Cassiodorus]], ''Chronicon'', 1289; [[Paul the Deacon]], ''Historia Romana'', xv.2; [[John of Antioch (chronicler)|John of Antioch]], fragments 209.1\u20132, 207, translated by C.D. Gordon, ''The Age of Attila'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1966), pp. 122f<\/ref> Following the execution of Romanus by Anthemius, Ricimer moved north to [[Mediolanum]] with a force of several thousand soldiers. Relations between the two deteriorated to the point that [[Epiphanius of Pavia]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|bishop of Milan]], was asked to negotiate peace between them.<ref>Related in Ennodius, ''Vita Epifanius'', 51-75; translated in Sr. Genevieve Marie Cook, The Life of Saint Epiphanius by Ennodius: A translation with an introduction and commentary (Washington: Catholic University of America, 1942), pp. 53-63.<\/ref>\n\nDespite the bishop's efforts, open warfare broke out between Ricimer and Anthemius again in 472. Ricimer, along with his barbarian mercenary units (including the soldiers of [[Odoacer]]), marched on Rome. Besieged, Anthemius took refuge in [[Old St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's Basilica]]. The Eastern Emperor Leo dispatched [[Olybrius]] to mediate a truce between Ricimer and Anthemius but, according to John Malalas, had sent a secret letter to Anthemius, urging him to kill Olybrius. Ricimer intercepted the letter, showed it to Olybrius, and had him proclaimed emperor.<ref>John Malalas, ''Chronographica'', 373\u2013374.<\/ref> The siege lasted for five months. Ricimer finally entered the city and succeeded in separating the port on the [[Tiber]] from the [[Palatine]], starving the supporters of the emperor.<ref name=\"john_antioch_209.1-2\">John of Antioch, fragment 209.1\u20132; translated by C.D. Gordon, ''The Age of Attila'', pp. 122f<\/ref> Both sides appealed to the field army in Gaul, but the [[Burgundians|Burgundian]] commanding general of Gaul, [[Gundobad]], supported his uncle Ricimer.\n\nAnthemius held out until his supporters deserted him. Disguised as a beggar, the emperor was caught attempting to flee the city at the Church of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]], where he was beheaded on July 11, 472.<ref>John of Antioch, fragment 209, translated by C.D Gordon, ''Age of Attila'', pp. 122f<\/ref> Ricimer then proclaimed [[Olybrius]] as emperor, who was the candidate for emperor that he and Geiseric had once favored.\n\n==Death==\nRicimer's rule lasted until his death from a hemorrhage on August 18, 472, six weeks after deposing Anthemius. His title of patrician and position as supreme commander were assumed by his nephew [[Gundobad]].\n\nWithout a powerful figure to guide it, the Western Roman Empire experienced an even more rapid succession of emperors, none of whom was able to effectively consolidate power. The line of Western Roman Emperors ended with [[Odoacer's deposition of Romulus Augustulus]] (arguably in either 476 or 480), reunifying the imperial power in far-off Constantinople.\n\n==Appearances in opera==\nRicimer's life was used as a subject of opera libretti in the 17th and 18th centuries, embellishing his biography with romantic and political intrigues. The earliest setting was [[Matteo Noris]]'s ''Ricimero re de' Vandali'' (set by [[Carlo Pallavicino]], 1684), which focuses on the installation of Arthemius in Rome and the promise of marriage to his daughter Domizia. A better-known setting was [[Apostolo Zeno]] and [[Pietro Pariati]]'s libretto ''Flavio Anicio Olibrio'', set by [[Francesco Gasparini]] (1708), [[Nicola Porpora]] (1711), [[Leonardo Vinci]] (1728), and [[Niccol\u00f2 Jommelli]] (1740). This libretto is based on Ricimer's siege of Rome and his relationship with Olybrius and their loves.<ref>{{GroveOnline|Ricimer|Paul Cauthen|January 12|2014}}<\/ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Ricimer |volume=23 |page=314}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Friedrich Anders: ''Flavius Ricimer: Macht und Ohnmacht des westr\u00f6mischen Heermeisters in der zweiten H\u00e4lfte des 5.

His paintings examine the contemporary relationship with consumerism and branding among other themes.

His use of neutral colors and depictions of the human form delve beyond [[pop culture]] and bring to the surface many of the things that operate underneath the cultural construct.  Aspects of Micallef's work examines our dichotomous relationship with [[consumerism]], questioning how we can despise multi-national brands yet still allow ourselves to be seduced by them. He frequently uses the union of two opposites to make an intriguing chemistry. Micallef's practice has been summarized as 'critical pop', exposing the darker side of our consumerist society and the [[human condition]].\n\nHis painting style has been compared to [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]] and is seen as an [[wikt:amalgamation|amalgamation]] of influences from the old masters such as [[Caravaggio]] and [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez|Vel\u00e1zquez]] to more modern contemporary photographers and [[graphic artists]]. His depiction of the human body and mark making echo his teachings from [[John Virtue]], a former student of [[Frank Auerbach]]. The rawness of expressionistic [[painterly]] marks is a stark contrast to the more graphic elements which surfaces throughout his work.\n\nFrom 18 June 2007 [[Sotheby's]] catalogue:\n{{quote|Having won second prize in the BP\/Amoco Portrait of the Year awards in 2000, Anthony Micallef moved away from strict [[Portrait painting|portraiture]] preferring to combine his exquisite [[draughtsmanship]] with a dark and passionate exploration of colour and contemporary expressionism as a means of dissecting what he sees as the frivolities of pop culture. He says, \"The trouble with pop imagery is that it doesn\u2019t really go deeper than the surface, you have to drag it down and challenge it to make it interesting. When you put two contrasting images together it causes friction and that is the bit I\u2019m interested in.\" In the present work, the dark, [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Bacon]]-esque smears to the face conjure unlooked for associations when combined with the delicately alluring roses, the juxtaposition revealing at once the [[saccharine]] seduction of colourful pop imagery and consumerism alongside its dark and troubling underbelly. This complexity and brutal beauty explain why Anthony Micallef has become one of the most promising young artists working in Britain today.<ref name=News>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.antonymicallef.com\/news.php|title=Antony Micallef - News|publisher=antonymicallef.com|accessdate=2010-08-08}}<\/ref>}}\n\nIn 2012 to go alongside the AKA Peace Exhibition at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] (ICA) <ref name=\"peaceoneday\">{{cite web|url=http:\/\/peaceoneday.org\/aka-peace-2012\/ |title= Peace One Day\u2019s 2012 Art Project |work=peaceoneday.org |date=2012-07-12 |accessdate=2013-03-07}}<\/ref> [[Art Below]] showcased selected works from the AKA Peace series on the [[London Underground]] including Micallef's. \"AKA Peace\" originally conceived by photographer Bran Symondson and now curated by artist [[Jake Chapman]], is an exhibition of new works made specially for The [[Peace One Day]] Project 2012, bringing together a group of Contemporary Artists, all of whom agreed to transform a decommissioned [[AK-47]] assault rifle, refashioning into artworks.<ref name=\"AKABelow\">{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.artbelow.org.uk\/ab\/Exhibitions.action?Open&exhibitionId=86|title= AKA BELOW |work=artbelow.org.uk |date=2012-11-27 |accessdate=2013-03-07}}<\/ref>\n\n==Artist Statement==\n\n{{cquote|When I begin painting a face it feels like I'm facing for marks randomly, trying to catch an expression of a character, an identity.<ref name=Micallef>{{cite web |url=http:\/\/www.the-artists.org\/ArtistView.cfm?id=7783040C-9CF0-0DE9-0A0BD2AABAC7E934\n|title=Antony Micallef\n|publisher=the-artists.org\n|accessdate=2006-08-04\n|archiveurl = http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20060613222920\/http:\/\/www.the-artists.org\/ArtistView.cfm?id=7783040C-9CF0-0DE9-0A0BD2AABAC7E934 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-06-13}}<\/ref>}}\n\n{{cquote|My work is like watching a Disney movie which slowly turns into violent pornography.<ref name=\"Micallef\"\/>}}\n\n==Key Exhibitions==\n\nTunnel 228. <br \/>\nMay 2009.
