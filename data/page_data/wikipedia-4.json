One of the earliest references to St. Oswald's can be found in Bradshaw's [http:\/\/www.medievalchester.ac.uk\/texts\/reading\/bradshaw.html?page=10#StO-1 Life of St. Werburge (Chapter 4)] The Parish Registers date back to 1580.

A chapel dedicated to St. Thomas Becket stood by 1200 in the graveyard belonging to St. Werburgh's abbey outside the Northgate, in the fork of the later Parkgate and Liverpool roads. Serving also as the meeting place for the abbot's manor court of St. Thomas, it became a private house called Green Hall after the Dissolution. The building probably survived only until the demolition of the northern suburbs during the Civil War siege, though in 1821 it was claimed that the former chapel was still in use as a barn.<ref>'Churches and religious bodies: Medieval chapels', A History of the County of Chester: Volume 5 part 2: The City of Chester: Culture, Buildings, Institutions (2005), pp. 156-159<\/ref> Today on the site is the pub The George & Dragon.\n\nThe church of St. Thomas of Canterbury as built between 1869 and 1872 by Sir George Gilbert Scott had a chancel with a south aisle and an aisled nave of three bays, all in an Early English style. On becoming the parish church in 1881, the church was enlarged to the designs of J. O. Scott (younger son of George Gilbert Scott) with a faculty being granted giving permission to enlarge the nave and aisle by adding two bays and erecting a porch on the north side; to build a tower (which was never completed) and place a clock and bells therein; to place a pulpit, reredos, and sedilia in the church; to remove and re-erect the font at the west end of the church; to construct a heating apparatus; to construct an organ chamber and two vestries for the use of the clergy and choir; to place new seats for use of the choir and seat the whole of the church with open seats; to place stained glass in all the windows (with a spire which was never completed).<ref>Church Faculty 1881, copy held in Cheshire & Chester Archives, P 29\/17\/3<\/ref> In 1896 permission was given to re-seat the chancel with oak seats and desks for the choir and clergy, cost of clergy seats to be defrayed by Henry John Birch and John Shenton Latham, churchwardens, cost of choir seats out of a legacy of \u00a3100 bequeathed by the late Miss Eliza Ann Ward and by voluntary contributions.<ref>Church Faculty, 1896, copy held in Cheshire & Chester Archives, P 29\/17\/5<\/ref> The High Altar reredos designed by Charles Deacon was installed in 1909.\n\n[[File:St. Thomas' groudplan 1880-82.jpg|thumb|Ground plan for the westward extension by two bays, with completion of tower and spire, John Scott]]\n\nSt. Thomas's opened as the parish church in 1881 with between 190 and 250 communicants. Services then included a weekly communion, held in the early morning or at midday. An experiment with a choral communion in 1889 did not meet with universal approval, and Sunday services remained unchanged for another twenty years. More successful was the establishment in 1895 of the mission church of the Good Shepherd on South View Road in the western part of the parish.  A curate was required for services there, and in the early 20th century the vicar generally had two curates. In the early 1910s the congregation at the mission church usually numbered 50\u201380, ten or twenty of whom were communicants, but services were cut back in 1918 and discontinued in 1919.<ref>Mission Church Register of services, Jan 1912 - Sep 1919, held in Cheshire & Chester Archives, P 29\/3521\/8<\/ref> The building seems not to have been used regularly thereafter and in the mid-1960s the mission church of the Good Shepherd was finally closed. The mission church was also home to the Sealand Road C. of E. Infants' school. Sealand Road Infant School was opened in January 1883 in the Mission Church of the Good Shepherd, attached to St. Oswald's parish, in South View, off Tower Wharf. It was forced to close in December 1921 because the managers were unable to carry out structural repairs.<ref>A short history of our church building, Ian Thomas (Parish Newsletter September 2010)<\/ref>\n\nH. E. Burder (vicar 1909\u201348) introduced Anglo Catholic services at St. Thomas's, with a daily mass and a sung celebration on Sundays, a tradition which continued under his successors.  From 1948 onwards the Vicar of St Oswald's Parish was priest in charge of the church of Little St John alias St John without the Northgate, and in 1967 the two benefices were officially united to become The united benefice of St Oswald with Little St John, Chester.\n\n''Notice is hereby given that Her Majesty in Council was pleased on the 28th November 1967, to make an Order in Council approving a Scheme framed by the Church Commissioners for effecting the union of the benefice of Saint Oswald, Chester, and the benefice of Little Saint John, Chester, both in the diocese of Chester.''<ref>Order in Council, 28th November 1967<\/ref>\n\nIn 1969 Little St John's church ceased to be used for church services when a faculty was granted confirming a lease by the owners, the City Municipal Charities Trustees, to Chester Corporation, for secular use. St. Oswald's Parish was incorporated in the new parish of Chester in 1972, St. Thomas of Canterbury remaining in use as one of four churches serving the parish.<ref>A short history of our church building by Ian Thomas (Parish Magazine September 2010)<\/ref> The Parish name of Saint Oswald was lost at the formation of the Chester Team Parish, which grouped all the parish churches in the City of Chester into one single parish.<ref>London Gazette, Order in Council 1972<\/ref>\n\nOn March 1, 2005 Chester Team Parish was dissolved into two new parishes. The new Parish is called ''Saint Oswald and Saint Thomas of Canterbury'', which restores the ancient [[Patron Saint]] of the Parish and incorporates the patron of the parish church. The remaining part of the Team Parish of Chester forms the ''Parish of Saint Peter with Saint John the Baptist''.<ref>Order in Council, 2005<\/ref>\n\nThe former red brick [[St Oswald's Vicarage, Chester|vicarage]] and attached parish room were built to serve the parish of St Oswald and the church of St Thomas of Canterbury in 1880 to a design by John Douglas. The building now houses the English Department of The University of Chester.<ref>{{NHLE |num= 1375900|desc= Old Vicarage and Parish Room to Church of St Thomas of Canterbury, Chester|accessdate= 11 April 2015|mode=cs2|ps=none|fewer-links=x}}<\/ref>\n\n==The Church Today==\nThe church is still firmly rooted in the [[Anglo-Catholic]] tradition on which it was founded.\nThe [[Parochial Church Council]] has recently released the Parish's mission statement which is:\n*Welcome all people\n*Proclaim God's love\n*Teach, Baptise and nurture\n*Respond to human need with loving service\n*Rejoice through the beauty of Word, Sacrament and music.\n\nThe church also has strong links with the local school which bears its name. Low Mass is currently celebrated three times a week, with choral High Mass on Sundays. Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament takes place most Wednesdays from 2-4pm. There is a well-attended annual [[Eucharist]]ic Festival. This is usually held in July. The Church's patron saint's day is December 29.\n\n==Organisations==\nSt. Thomas' benefits from a number of groups which help support the ministry of the church and provide fellowship among the members.

Its style is [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]], designed by [[Giles Gilbert Scott|Gilbert Scott]] and is still unfinished. The tower has a ringing chamber but lacks the bell chamber above and [[spire]]. some of the [[tracery]] around the windows and at the top of the [[nave]] columns remains incomplete, it is also possible that the walls and ceiling were intended to be plastered. This has also been left undone. The plan of the church consists of an East Tower at the end of the south aisle, the north aisle and a five-bay nave. The [[chancel]] is raised three steps above the nave with a further three steps at the other end of the choir into the sanctuary. There is a [[Lady Chapel]] at the end of the north aisle, which again is raised three steps above the nave.\n\n==Architectural features==\nThere are two magnificently-carved [[reredos]]es by Deacon, one in the Lady Chapel (1913) and one in the sanctuary (1909). The Lady Chapel reredos features a [[Madonna and Child]] with the inscription \"Magnificat anima mea Dominum, et exsultavit spiritus meus in Deum\" from the [[Magnificat]] The Lady Chapel Altar has three carved panels featuring a [[pelican]] feeding her chicks with her own blood, a Lamb holding a Shepherd's staff with the inscription \"Ecce [[Agnus Dei]]\" and another carved panel depicting an [[Eagle]] in flight. Around the base of the Altar is carved the Inscription \"I believe in the Communion of Saints\" a quotation from the [[Nicene Creed]]. Permission was given by a Faculty dated 16 June 1913 to remove the tapestry hangings behind the communion table in the Lady chapel and erect in lieu a reredos of oak with the cost to be defrayed by Helen Catherine Tidswell of Northgate House, the reredos being intended to complete the memorial to her late husband Richard Thomas Tidswell.<ref>Faculty dated 16 June 1913<\/ref> The Faculty also provided for a canopy of carved oak for the font as a memorial of the late mother of Jane Wright of 22 Chichester Street.\n\nThe Reredos in the Sanctuary, which was installed in 1909, was by the architect Charles Deacon (1844\u20131927) as a memorial of Rev E C Lowndes, and is carved with the [[Arma Christi|Instruments of the Passion]]. Atop which are four statues of [[archangels]] [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] [[Gabriel (archangel)|Gabriel]] [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]] and [[Uriel]]. The wooden high [[altar]] (in the sanctuary) is decorated with three painted panels, featuring: the [[Annunciation]], the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] and the [[Visitation (Christian)|Visitation]].\n\nThe West Window is by [[Charles Eamer Kempe|Kempe]] dating from 1885. The [[baptismal font]] at the west end of the church used to have a magnificently-carved suspended cover which collapsed in 1980. Also at the West End there is a [[Sacristy]] created in 1897 and a choir [[vestry]].\n\nIn the south aisle there is an Altar to St. Oswald & St. Thomas with a Triptych of St. Oswald and St. Thomas of Canterbury which was dedicated on All Saints Day 2005 in memory of Irene Waller.<ref>Taken from a plaque in the South Aisle of the church<\/ref> and a wooden desk in memory of Ernest Waller containing a book with the names of the faithful departed.\n\nThe tower clock was erected as a thank offering for the birth of Beatrice Mary Latham by her parents John and Almeida Latham, Christmas 1913.<ref>Vestry Minutes 30 October 1913<\/ref> The clock was installed by J.B. Joyce and Co from Whitchurch, Shropshire.\n\n[[File:TriptychAll.jpg|thumb]]\n\nThe church bell bears the following inscription 'Sanci Oswaldi C W. J W. W W.' and was originally hung in the parish of St. Oswald, Chester and afterwards at Hilbre Island, before being taken from there to St. Oswald's Bidston at the suppression of the religious house and was hung in Bidston until 1856.<ref>The Church Plate of the City of Chester, T. Stanley Ball<\/ref>\n\n==Organ==\nThe current three-manual [[Electronic organ|digital organ]] was installed in 1996 by Wyvern Organs. The first organ was built by the Chester firm of organ builders C.H. Whiteley. This organ was rebuilt in 1901 by the organ builder Young and had three manuals. In 1984 this organ was replaced by a 2 manual organ built by Nicholson & Lord which lasted until 1996 with some of the pipework from the previous organ added to it. The Nicholson and Lord organ remained in the organ case until 2014 whereupon it was removed by Alsopp & Hind Organ Builders.

The incorporation was governed by the mayor, recorder, justices of the peace, and seventy-four other guardians. The Act also gave control of the Roodee workhouse for a period of 99 years.<ref>Burne, R.V.H.

A new workhouse was built Hoole in 1873 at a cost of about \u00a330,000. The design for the buildings was opened to competition and the winning plans were submitted by W Perkin and Sons.

This followed the building in Parkgate Road, in 1871, of a church dedicated to St. Thomas, which in 1881 became the parish church of St. Oswald's parish. In February 1871 an appeal was made to the National Society for funds towards the building of the school. This appeal gave two reasons for building the school, one being `to supply a want for a new district which has sprung up', and the other `to obviate the necessity which might otherwise arise for building a rate-aided school in this district'. The National Society voted \u00a355 towards the cost of building St. Thomas' school. Land was donated by the church and a grant of \u00a355 was given by the National Society allowing for the first part of the school to be built.<ref>Cheshire Record Office reference ZDES 40<\/ref> The school doors opened on 25 March 1873.

If tecemotide is not approved until 2015, GSK may terminate its obligation to supply the adjuvant MPL. In this case, Oncothyreon would retain the necessary licenses from GSK required to have the adjuvant MPL manufactured, but the transfer of the process to a third party would delay the development and commercialization of tecemotide.<ref>[http:\/\/ir.oncothyreon.com\/annuals.cfm Oncothyreon\u2019s Annual Report 2013 (Form 10-K)]<\/ref>\n\nGSK is developing the MAGE A3 vaccine in Phase 3, a direct competitor to tecemotide (see section below).\n\n===Risks related to competition===\n\nCompetition in NSCLC: There are currently two products approved as maintenance therapy following treatment of inoperable locoregional Stage III NSCLC with induction chemotherapy, [[erlotinib|Tarceva (erlotinib)]], a targeted small molecule from [[Genentech|Genentech, Inc.]], a member of the Roche Group, and [[pemetrexed|Alimta (pemetrexed)]], a chemotherapeutic from [[Eli Lilly and Company]]. Tecemotide has not been tested in combination with or in comparison to these products. It is possible that other existing or new agents will be approved for this indication. In addition, there are at least two vaccines in development for the treatment of NSCLC, including GSK\u2019s MAGE A3 vaccine in Phase 3 and [[Transgene SA|Transgene\u2019s]] TG-4010 in Phase 2\/3. TG-4010 also targets MUC1, although using technology different from tecemotide.<ref>[http:\/\/ir.oncothyreon.com\/annuals.cfm Oncothyreon\u2019s Annual Report 2013 (Form 10-K)]<\/ref>\n\n==Drug development cost==\nThe cost spent for the tecemotide development \u2013 beginning in the late 1990s \u2013 have not been published in detail by the companies Biomira\/Oncothyreon, Merck KGaA and Ono Pharmaceutical. Additionally, the estimation of full cost of bringing a new drug to market \u2013 from discovery through clinical trials to approval \u2013 is complex and controversial.\n\nHowever, a cautious estimate of the tecmotide development cost spent until 2014 ranges from 300 to 500 million Euros (390 to 650 million US$; for more information see [[Drug development]]).\n\n==History==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:10em\" | Date !!

These range from dehydration and diarrhea to high fevers and malaria, but also include more broad phenomena, such as gender-based violence and maternal health. All of these ailments, however, are multiplied for refugee women because of the external factors contributing to their particularly poor health. These external factors include culturally-reinforced gender inequality, limited mobility, lack of access to healthcare facilities, high population density within the refugee camps, and low levels of education.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Poureslami|first=IM|coauthors=et al.|title=Sociocultural, Environmental, and Health Challenges Facing Women and Children Living Near the Borders Between Afghanistan, Iran, and Pakistan (AIP Region)|journal=MedGenMen|date=September 20|year=2004|volume=6|issue=3|url=http:\/\/www.medscape.com\/viewarticle\/487825|accessdate=13 April 2011}}<\/ref> <ref>{{cite web|title=Women as Refugees: A Health Overview|url=http:\/\/www.globalhealth.org\/images\/pdf\/events\/krause_041806.pdf|publisher=Women\u2019s Commission for Refugee Women and Children|accessdate=13 April 2011}}<\/ref> <ref>{{cite web|title=Women\u2019s Concerns|url=http:\/\/www.unhcr.org\/pages\/49c3646c1e2.html|publisher=UNHCR}}<\/ref>      \n\nOne of the biggest concerns regarding female refugees\u2019 health is their reproductive health. In refugee situations, reproductive health often falls to the bottom of the list of priorities, primarily because in situations where healthcare is already scarce, life-saving measures are often of prime concern. Much of reproductive health is not seen as a \u201clife or death\u201d issue, although it clearly is. Because of the lack of healthcare infrastructure in refugee-dense areas, women often give birth without any trained medical staff present. Complications during birth can often result from a lack of healthcare assistants or medical facilities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reproductive Health in Refugee Situations: An Interagency Field Manual|url=http:\/\/www.un.org\/en\/documents\/udhr|publisher=UNHCR|accessdate=13 April 2011}}<\/ref>  \n\nAnother key healthcare concern is that of gender-based violence within the refugee camps.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sexual and Gender-Based Violence against Refugees, Returnees and Internally Displaced Persons|url=http:\/\/www.unhcr.org\/3f696bcc4.html|publisher=UNHCR|accessdate=13 April 2011}}<\/ref>   It is generally recognized that, \u201cdisplacement, uprootedness, the loss of community structures, the need to exchange sex for material goods or protection all lead to distinct forms of violence, particularly sexual violence against women,\u201d<ref>{{cite web|title=Reproductive Health in Refugee Situations: An Interagency Field Manual|url=http:\/\/www.un.org\/en\/documents\/udhr|publisher=UNHCR|accessdate=13 April 2011}}<\/ref>  making women in refugee situations particularly vulnerable.

Especially related to this sentence: \"[...] as they only seem to cool air just around drop stairs or access panels [...] [1]\". That paragraph is based on citation [1]. I've read citation [1]. The writer of that paragraph mis-understood what citation [1] is trying to say about drop stairs and access panels.\n\nBy the way, citation [1] is no longer on the web. A Google cache version is here (don't know how long this cache will last): \n*[http:\/\/72.14.253.104\/search?q=cache:tWGuyr8L0bUJ:www.hometownannapolis.com\/cgi-bin\/read\/2005\/06_11-03\/HOM+attic+fans+do+more+harm+than+good&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us On the Level: Attic fans do more harm than good] \n\nI am citing the actual text relevant to the inaccuracy below, so that the article could be corrected even without the cache:\n\n<blockquote>\"Powered attic ventilators can and will pull conditioned air from the house. These fans will pull indoor air not from just around the drop stairs or access panels but from any penetration into the attic, such as wires going through top plates of walls, plumbing pipes, drywall that's not tight, etc. These fans can be counter-productive to your interior cooling efforts. You've already paid good money to cool the inside air and now you're additionally paying for the electricity used by the fan to pull it out.When the attic fan motors get old and wear out, the bearings can seize up and become a fire hazard. They are not something people keep an eye on. They get installed and then forgotten. I've met people who have lost their homes and all their possessions to fires begun by a malfunctioning attic vent fan. I found a hot, seized fan in an attic last week in an unoccupied house. It was hours or even minutes from causing a fire.\"<\/blockquote>\n\nI've deleted the \"Attic fans\" section, due to the inaccuracy. Plus, there is already an [[Attic fan]] stub. If anyone wishes to correct this inaccuracy, s\/he can re-write the article in the actual Attic fan stub.<small><span class=\"autosigned\">\u2014Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:65.125.183.194|65.125.183.194]] ([[User talk:65.125.183.194|talk]] \u2022 [[Special:Contributions\/65.125.183.194|contribs]]) <\/span><\/small><!-- Template:Unsigned -->\n\n==Question: whole house fan PLUS AC???==\nMy question is : might it not make sense to run both the whole house fan AND the AC?  I ask because I live in a four story house.  The top floor gets VERY hot... seems like with the rising heat, one could benefit by using the whole house fan.  Perhaps it wouldn't be on \"high\" power, but perhaps it might help some of the hot air vacate the house.  I see this as a very interesting question.  I realize that it completely contradicts the orthodox position, but I still think it's worth pursuing.  I wonder if anyone has tested this scientifically--how much power would be used in scenario A (AC only) vs. B (AC plus whole house fan).  I think in a vertical house such as mine, scenario B might lead to lower energy use.  I'd love to hear your thoughts. --[[User:Dylanfly|Dylanfly]] 18:53, 4 August 2007 (UTC)\n: I think you would be better off installing more than one unit (as necessary) to cool your house. Four stories is a lot to cool for one unit. Another suggestion is to provide air return vents to the a\/c system in the hottest parts of the house.   The difficulty with using a whole house fan to exhaust this hot air is that air must be blown (sucked) in somewhere else to replace the air being pushed out by the whole house fan. This (outside) air will be hot and humid.  It takes energy to pull the moisture out of the air, and this will lead to warmer air temps coming out of your vents. For the most part, you don't want to use a whole house fan and an a\/c at the same time. If you can seal off the top couple of stories, and isolate them from the a\/c system, a whole house fan might help up there (with windows open in the 3rd story). You must have a rather large a\/c system for a four story home. An a\/c professional will have great suggestions for you, including a process to determine how large of a system you need to meet your comfort needs. I doubt he or she will suggest a whole house fan and a\/c system at the same time.

However, I'm not going to correct them for the same reason that I'm not going to allow this discussion to continue -- it's completely inappropriate for Wikipedia. This talk page is for discussion about the article itself, not the article's subject. So if you have comments about the spelling, grammar, adherence to Wikipedia policies, etc., of the '''article''', then by all means feel free to post it here -- but if you're looking to talk about whole-house fans (not this Wikipedia article ''about'' them), then this is the wrong place -- contact an expert off-site. Some Google-searching should help you find sources for information, and I'm willing to volunteer my own expertise as a long-time worker in the fan industry. But again, this page is the wrong place for this. Please feel free to refer to [[Wikipedia:Talk page guidelines]] and [[WP:FORUM]]. Thank you. [[User:Piercetheorganist|Mr. P. S.

The question is relevant to the content of the article: the query asks about the known utility of a combination of whole house fan and AC.  If no such combination is common, then the content may not be useful for the article.  But there's also no need to insult [[User:Eyknough|Eyknough]]'s fine effort, nor to claim that you are \"not going to allow this discussion.\"  The whole tone is rather autocratic and haughty.  Let's be nice. [[User:Smilo Don|Smilo Don]] ([[User talk:Smilo Don|talk]]) 14:25, 2 April 2008 (UTC)\n::::Policy is policy, and by definition immutable.

I'm in the process of trying to correct these.\n\nIn an article on a current politician, it's absolutely critical that WP not give the impression that it's endorsing the candidate's positions on issues (or, for that matter, the positions of the candidate's opponents).  This means that we need to use arm's-length phrasing when reporting those positions.

She was the daughter of [[Louis IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt]].  On 3 October 1775 she married duke (later grand-duke) [[Charles Augustus, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Charles Augustus of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] and as such a member of the court sphere of [[Weimar Classicism]].  She was held to be serious and introverted but also compassionate and sympathetic, in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Jena]] which guaranteed her part in the later \"myth of Weimar\" (\"Weimarmythos\").\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early life===\nThe princess belonged to the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|House of Darmstadt]], which held the Hessian landgraviate. She was born on 30 January 1757 in [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]]'s Prussian capital, Berlin, where her parents were due to the [[Seven Years' War]]. Her father [[Louis IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt|Louis IX]] succeeded to the landgraviate in 1768 and was at the time of her birth fighting as a general for the Prussian forces. He was thus often away from his children and so the princess's education was in her mother [[Countess Palatine Caroline of Zweibr\u00fccken|Caroline]]'s hands. Caroline educated Louise in the evangelical Protestant tradition, and she became interested in literature and music.\n\nAs the youngest daughter, with eight siblings, Louise's education was important to improve her marriage prospects. Since Louis IX showed little interest in his children, it was vital to get Louise married off and a matter also in the hands of her mother, becoming known as the \"great Landgr\u00e4fin\" and von Zweibr\u00fccken due to her expert international dynastic politics in ancien regime Europe. In  1773 Louise travelled with her mother and sisters Amalie and Wilhelmine to Beschau then to the Russian court in [[St Petersburg]]. Tsarina [[Catharine II of Russia|Catharine II]] decided Louise was unsuitable as a wife for the grand-prince and future Tsar [[Paul I of Russia|Paul]], preferring her sister Wilhemine. This rebuff and her relationship with her future brother-in-law Paul formed Louise, leading to her being a persistent influence in the Russian state.\n\nNevertheless this journey was not without influence on Louise, since on the way to Russia Caroline had learned of another female regent of a small German state - [[Anna Amalia von Braunschweig-Wolfenb\u00fcttel (Sachsen-Weimar-Eisenach)|Anna Amalia]]. Anna and Louise probably found favour together.\n\n===Marriage===\nAt the end of this acquaintance, under the influence of the governor in Erfurt from the [[Archbishopric of Mainz]], [[Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg]], the 18-year-old Louise was betrothed to the young knight Carl August of [[Sachsen-Weimar]]. The marriage occurred on 3 October 1775 at the Karlsruher court, where (as a new princess-consort) Louise became caught up in the [[Ernestine duchies|Ernestine]] Weimar court.\n\nThe marriage was wholly dynastic in purpose (her sisters were married off to [[Frederick William II of Prussia|heir to Prussia]] and the [[Paul I of Russia|Tsarevitch]]), consolidating the duchy of Saxe-Weimar's place at the heart of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Primary and secondary sources agree that it was as unhappy, with Louise (noted for her delicacy and timidity) had difficulty fitting in at court and remained in the shadow of her mother-in-law, the dowager duchess Anna Amalia. Louise especially attended the convents in her new country. A [[Romanticism|Romantic]] ''avant la lettre'', she did not have a taste for the Romantic lifestyle. [[Goethe]] was court poet and minister to her husband (and his companion in his extra-marital affairs), but was moved by her charm, noble-heartedness and her eyes \"the colour of cornflowers\". Taking her under his wing, Goethe  dedicated the following words to her:\n{{Cquote|I know one, thin as the lily \/ Whose pride is only innocence. \/ No one - not even Solomon - ever saw her like. <br>(J'en sais une, mince comme lys\/ Dont la fiert\u00e9 n'est qu'innocence.\/ Nul - pas m\u00eame Salomon -n'en vit de pareille.)}}\n\nAfter four years of marriage, in 1779 Louise finally gave birth her first child; sadly, wasn't the hoped male heir but a daughter, named after her and lived only five years; her next pregnancy, in 1781, produced a second daughter who died immediately after birth. At this time the Weimar ducal court also went through its [[sturm und drang]] phase, drawing not only Goethe but also the Ernestines from Miseleien and Eseleien. The resulting emotional coldness did not help their marriage, with her husband publicly humiliating the marriage by a long-term affair with the actress [[Karoline Jagemann]]. Louise only gave him the heir in 1783, with the birth of [[Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Charles Frederick]]; after him, followed four more children, of whom two survive infancy: [[Princess Caroline Louise of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Caroline Louise]] in 1786 and [[Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1792\u20131862)|Bernhard]] in 1792. With the birth of Bernhard the marriage had finally served its purpose of guaranteeing the succession to the throne and the continuation of the dynasty. Charles Frederick later married [[Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia (1786-1859)|Maria]] (sister of [[Alexander I of Russia]], and their daughter [[Augusta of Saxe-Weimar]] married prince [[Wilhelm I, German Emperor|Wilhelm of Prussia]], thus becoming the first empress of Germany.\n\n===Napoleonic Wars===\nLouise had her great moment in October 1806. Despite her childhood and her early experiences in Weimar, she was a great influence in literary circles. The [[battle of Jena-Auerstedt]] (14 October), led to the defeat of the Prussian-Saxon forces and the total submission of all the German states to France and precipitated the fall of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Soon after the battle, the victorious French troops advanced on Weimar. The other family members either fled or were away fighting in the Prussian forces, and so Louise remained in Weimar as mother and protector of the nation.\n\nTwo days after the battle she ended up opposing [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] himself. He insisted that her husband withdraw from Prussian military service but she quite undiplomatically made it clear to Napoleon that he could not do so. Nevertheless, at her husband's request and inspired by the example of the German patriot queen [[Princess Louise of Prussia (1808-1870)|Louise of Prussia]], she managed to arrange the French plundering of the area so that Weimar got of lightly compared to the university-city of Jena. Whether Napoleon let himself soften towards Louise, or whether he acted this way due to his own calculations in power-politics remains open to discussion. The Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach duchy remained with the alliance upon the [[Treaty of Pozna\u0144]] and survived the Napoleonic era via further politicking. Since Louise was now considered as the country's leader, and her subjects and contemporaries maintained this image of her - along with her part in the Weimar myth.\n\nIn 1815 her politicking during the war ensured that at the [[Congress of Vienna]] her husband's small duchy not only retained all its territory but rose to become a grand duchy (her [[Thuringia]]n cousins the [[house of Saxony]], in contrast, merely preserved their title of duke). She then became devoted to ambassadorial duties. The Russian alliance ended with her successor [[Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia (1786-1859)|Maria Pawlowna]]. The jubilee of her rule and her golden wedding, both in 1825, passed with little celebration and - already very withdrawn - she died aged 73 on 14 February 1830.\n\n==Issue==\n[[Image:Karl August Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach children.jpg|thumbnail|right|150px|'''Charles Augustus and Louise's three surviving children: Charles Frederick, Caroline Louise and Bernhard.''']]\nShe and Charles Augustus had 7 children, of whom only three survive adulthood:<ref>[http:\/\/wwperson.informatik.uni-erlangen.de\/cgi-bin\/l1\/LANG=engl\/INDEX=I130697 ''Louise Auguste Prinzessin v.Hessen-Darmstadt'' in: Genealogy Database by Herbert Stoyan] [retrieved 14 November 2014].<\/ref>\n* Louise Auguste Amalie (Weimar, 3 February 1779 \u2013 Weimar, 24 March 1784).\n* A daughter (born and died Weimar, 10 September 1781).\n* [[Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] (Weimar, 2 February 1783 \u2013 Schloss Belvedere, Weimar, 8 July 1853).\n* A son (born and died Weimar, 26 February 1785).\n* [[Princess Caroline Louise of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Caroline Louise]] (Weimar, 18 July 1786 \u2013 Ludwigslust, 20 January 1816), married Hereditary Prince [[Frederick Louis of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]].\n* A son (born and died, Weimar, 13 April 1789).\n* [[Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1792\u20131862)|Charles Bernhard]] (Weimar, 30 May 1792 \u2013 Liebenstein, 31 July 1862).\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel top|width=100%}}\n{{ahnentafel-compact5\n|style=font-size: 90%; line-height: 110%;\n|border=1\n|boxstyle=padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0;\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

They are among the few butterflies that breed on plants of the [[cycad]] family.\n\n==Description==\n:''See [[glossary of Lepidopteran terms|glossary]] for terms used''\n\n===Wet-season brood===\nMale upperside is lavender-blue. Fore wing has the costa narrowly and terminal margin more broadly fuscous brown, the latter with in addition an anticiliary black line; cilia light brown transversely traversed close to but not at their bases by a dark brown line. Hind wing: costa narrowly fuscous brown; a sub-terminal series of black spots outwardly edged by a white line; the spot in interspace 2 the largest and inwardly crowned more or less broadly with ochraceous yellow; an anticiliary black line and the cilia as on the fore wing.\nUnderside: greyish brown. Fore and hind wings: the following transverse darker brown markings on each wing, the markings edged on the inner and outer sides with white lines\u2014a short bar across the discocellulars, a discal catenulated band, the posterior two elongate spots of which on the fore wing are ''en Echelon'', while the band on the hind wing in bisinuate and is capped anteriorly near the costa by a round black spot encircled with white; the above are followed by maculated inner and outer subterminal bands, which on the hind wing are curved and more or less interrupted on the tornal area by a comparatively large round black spot ill interspace 2 and a smaller similar spot in interspace 1, both spots inwardly crowned with ochraceous; the white edgings on the inner side to both sub-terminal bands on the hind wing are more or less lunular. In addition on the same wing there is a subbasal curved row of four white-encircled spots, of which the anterior two and the spot on the dorsum are black, the other dark brown. Antennae black, shafts ringed with white; head, thorax and abdomen brown, the head and thorax clothed with bluish hairs; beneath: palpi, thorax and abdomen whitish.\n\nFemale upperside: brown. Fore wing: shot with blue from base outwards for a little over half its length down its middle, this blue irroration not extended to the costal margin; a slender anticiliary black line. Hind wing: a touch of blue iridescence near base; terminal markings much as on the forewing but the subterminal spots larger and not extended beyond interspace 6 ; in addition postdiscally there is a lightening of the shade of the ground-colour, between which paler area and the subterminal spots tho ground-colour assumes the form of a post-discal, short, transverse lunular band.\n\nUnderside of female as in the male, the markings slightly larger and more clearly defined. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in the male but slightly paler.\n<gallery>\nImage:Plains cupid (chilades pandava) I IMG 0009.jpg|Wet-season brood, [[Kolkata]]. \nImage:Plains_cupid_(chilades_pandava)_I_IMG_9966.jpg|Wet-season brood, [[Kolkata]]. \nImage:Plains cupid (chilades pandava) I IMG 9961.jpg|Wet-season brood, [[Kolkata]]. \nImage:Plains cupid (chilades pandava) laying eggs I IMG 9965.jpg|Wet-season brood- Laying eggs at New Alipore, [[Kolkata]]. \nImage:Plains cupid (Chilades pandava) on Coat buttons (Tridax procumbens) in Hyderabad W2 IMG 7106.jpg|Wet-season brood- on Coat buttons ''[[Tridax procumbens]]''  in  [[Hyderabad, India]]. \nImage:Plains cupid (chilades pandava) I IMG 9971.jpg| Wet-season brood- At New Alipore, [[Kolkata]].\n<\/gallery>\n\n===Dry season brood===\nVery similar to the same sexes of the wet-season brood, but can be recognized by the following differences:\u2014Upperside: Male Ground-colour slightly duller; sub-terminal spots on the hind wing less clearly defined. Female: The blue shot area extended outwards on the fore wing for three-fourths of its length from base, but as in wet-season specimens not reaching the costal margin; on the hind wing the blue suffusion covers the entire medial portion of the wing from the base to the subterminal row of spots, of which latter the spot in interspace 2 is entirely without the inner ochraceous edging.\n\nUnderside: ground-colour darker than in specimens of the wet-season brood, the discocellular and discal transverse bands on both fore and hind wings broader, the terminal markings very ill-defined, the inner white edging to the inner of the two subterminal transverse bands broadened and very diffuse. On the hind wing the discocellular and discal bands coalesce and form an ill-defined diffuse medial cloud on the wing.<ref name=\"Bingham\">Bingham, C. T. 1907. Fauna of British India. Butterflies.

The larva throughout is very rough, widely pitted or depressed and covered with very minute white tubercles bearing very short fine hairs, neither the hairs nor the tubercles being visible without a lens. The body at its highest and widest part is wider than high. It is extremely variable in its markings, hardly any two being exactly alike; there is usually a dark, dorsal, subdorsal and lateral line dividing the upper surface of the body into three equal areas, the dorsal and two subdorsal lines coalescing on the eleventh segment and forming a broad band to the thirteenth. In some specimens the divisions between the segments are marked with darker and there is a subdorsal series of oblique dark lines, one on each segment between the dorsal and subdorsal lines. The underside of the body and legs seems to be always green. The erectile organs on the twelfth segment very small, feeds in Calcutta on ''[[Cycas revoluta]]''. In Calcutta three species of ants attend this larva, which Professor Forel has identified for me as ''Prenolepis longicornis'', Latr., ''Monomorium speculare'', Mayr and ''Crematogaster, n. sp.''\" ([[Lionel de Nic\u00e9ville]] quoted in Bingham)<ref name=\"Bingham\"\/>\n\n===Pupa===\n\"Of the usual Lycaenid form, quite smooth, more or less fuscous, with a darker dorsal and subdorsal line, head-case somewhat square, thorax slightly humped and constricted posteriorly, spiracles pale. Though the larva) swarm in April and May in Calcutta on tho cultivated cycads in gardens, eating the hardly opened shoots or fronds, thereby utterly destroying the appearance of the plant for the year, I have never succeeded in finding the pupa on the plants, and can only conclude that the ants drive the full-grown larvae down the stems of the plants into their nests, where the larvae undergo their transformations.\"  (de Niceville.)<ref name=\"Bingham\"\/>\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Chilades_pandava_by_kadavoor.JPG|thumb|Plains Cupids in a fight to mate\nImage:Chilades pandava egglaying cb blore.JPG|Plains Cupid Female laying eggs\nImage:Chilades pandava early instar caterpillar cb blore.JPG|Plains Cupid Early instar caterpillar tended by ants\n<\/gallery>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Plains cupid (9).jpg|Seen in [[Chennai]]\nFile:Plains cupid (14).jpg|Seen in [[Chennai]]\nFile:Plains cupid (5).jpg|Seen in [[Chennai]]\n<\/gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Chilades pandava}}\n*[http:\/\/www.asahi-net.or.jp\/~EY4Y-TKNM\/philframe.html Photos of ''E. pandava'' (as ''Chilades pandava'') from the Philippines]\n\n[[Category:Chilades]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of India]]\n[[Category:Insects described in 1829]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Singapore]]","timestamp":"20160410101406","user-timestamp":"20150410101406"},{"title":"Talk:FxCop","content":"{{WikiProjectBannerShell|1=\n{{WikiProject Computing |class=Start |software=yes |software-importance=Unknown |importance=Unknown}}\n{{WikiProject Microsoft |class=start |importance=unknown |net=yes |net-importance=mid}}\n}}\n\n==What does the name mean?==\nWhat does the name mean and where did it come from?\n[[User:Tzadikv|Tzadik]] ([[User talk:Tzadikv|talk]]) 14:33, 27 May 2009 (UTC)\n\nFxCop is a word means:\n1.

The perspective was developed in the joint authorship of ''[http:\/\/bookshelved.org\/cgi-bin\/wiki.pl?UnderstandingComputersAndCognition Understanding Computers and Cognition]'' by [[Fernando Flores]] and [[Terry Winograd]] in 1987.\n\n== Overview ==\nAs part of a reflection published in 2006, [[Terry Winograd]] describes the language-action perspective as resting on two key orienting principles:\n:The first is its focus on linguistic communication as the basis for understanding what occurs in information systems. Ultimately ''all information is communication'': not an abstract system of bits and bytes but a means by which people interact.\n:The second principle is that ''language is action''. Through their linguistic acts people effect change in the world. In imposing a language-action framework on information technology, we emphasize the action dimension over the more traditional dimension of information content.<ref>http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1125944.1125978 Terry Winograd, \"Developing a framework for effective design principles\", [[Communications of the ACM]], May 2006<\/ref>\n\n''Language is action'' argues that speech isn't simply composed of assertions about the situation: utterances may also create a situation, such as, \"Let's go to the park.\" That utterance may be subject to interpretation but is not verifiable via the state of the world.<ref>Winograd, Flores 1987 p. 35<\/ref> This principle is closely linked to the ideas from [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. Furthermore, language is not the transmission of information, which simply correspond to the state of the world. By creating a situation, language forms a consensual domain to further encourage more action through language. These [Speech act|speech acts] may often take the form of commitment to other actions.<ref>Winograd, Flores 1987 p. 76-77<\/ref>\n\nIn the design of information systems, the perspective is based upon the notion as proposed by [[Terry Winograd]] that information technology may be limited in its ability to improve human communication.  \"Expert behavior requires an exquisite sensitivity to context and an ability to know what to commit to. Computing machines, which are purposely designed to process symbols independent of their context, have no hope of becoming experts.\".<ref>[http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1125944.1125973 (cited by) Hans Weigand, ''Two Decades of the Language-Action Perspective]'', [[Communications of the ACM]], May 2006<\/ref>  That sensitivity to context is thus more in the realm of the [[human]] than in that of the [[artificial intelligence|artificial]].<ref>''The Language\/Action Perspective'' [http:\/\/hci.stanford.edu\/winograd\/action\/language-action-conf.html International Workshop on Communication Modeling (LAP'96)] Tilburg, The Netherlands, JULY 1-2 1996<\/ref> \n\n== History ==\nResearch on LAP was done in the [[Apple Advanced Technology Group|Advanced Technology Group]] (ATG) at Apple Computer in the late 1980s.  Winograd was invited to present the basic concepts in a seminar at Apple in the winter of 1988.  Some Apple ATG researchers, notably Tom Pittard and Brad Hartfield, saw potential for enhancing the [[user experience]] of network based computer interactions if LAP was included in the mix of basic design considerations.<ref>'''Language, Action, and Computer Network Interaction''', Apple Technical Report No:14, PITTARD, February 1989, Dept. of Special Collections, Stanford University Libraries, M1007<\/ref>  \n\nResearch on the application of LAP to business process modelling was done in the System Modelling Research Group, Faculty of Computing, Engineering and Mathematical Sciences, University of the West of England in the early 2000s.<ref>''Using A Language Action Framework To Extend Organizational Process Modelling'', Beeson, I., and Green, S., [http:\/\/www.cems.uwe.ac.uk\/~sjgreen\/UKAIS2003.pdf UK Academy for Information Systems (UKAIS) Conference 2003, University of Warwick, April 9th - 11th, 2003]<\/ref>\n\n== Applications ==\nInsights from related work have been applied over the past two decades.

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] all secular plays were called ''comedias'', which embraced three genres: [[tragedy]], [[drama]], and [[comedy]] itself.  During the [[Spanish Golden Age]], ''corrals'' became popular sites for theatrical presentations in the early 16th century, when the theater took on a special importance in the country. The performance was held in the afternoon and lasted two to three hours, there being no intermission, and few breaks. The entertainment was continuous, including complete shows with parts sung and danced. All spectators were placed according to their sex and social status.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Almagro. Representaci\u00f3n del M\u00e9dico Apaleado.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Performance of ''El M\u00e9dico Apaleado.'']]\nBefore the end of the 16th century there were no buildings devoted to theater in Spain. Representations of ''comedias'' were instead held in the courtyard of houses or inns where a stage with background scenery was improvised along one of the sides. The three remaining sides served as public galleries to the wealthy, with the remaining spectators watching the play from the open courtyard. This structure was maintained in permanent theaters built for the purpose from the end of the sixteenth century, called ''corrals de comedias,'' which used the open-air enclosed rectangular courtyard typical of a block of houses.<ref name=Haza>{{Cite web|url=http:\/\/aix1.uottawa.ca\/~jmruano\/Corral.html|title=El Corral del Pr\u00edncipe (1583-1744)|accessdate=August 2013|last=Ruano de la Haza|first=Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda|language=Spanish}}<\/ref>\n\nThe first permanent theater of this type, [[Teatro de la Cruz|Corral de la Cruz]], was constructed in [[Madrid]] in 1579.

In front of the stage was the outdoor patio at the end of which sat the so-called ''musketeers.'' The balconies and windows of the adjoining houses formed the quarters reserved for men and women of nobility. In Madrid, above the ''cazuela'', were the quarters of the councilors and other authorities, such as the chairman of the [[Council of Castile]].<ref name=Corral>{{Cite web|url=http:\/\/www.corraldecomedias.com\/|title=Compa\u00f1ia del Corral de Comedias de Almagro|accessdate=August 2013|language=Spanish}}<\/ref>\n\nOn the upper floors were the ''desvanes'' (attics), very small quarters, among which stood the [[tertulia]] of the church and a second ''cazuela.'' The stage and lateral galleries  were protected by an overhang. An [[awning]], hung from hooks, protected the men of the common public who sat in the patio from the sun, avoiding contrast between sunlit and shaded areas, such as was found on stage and in the courtyard. That probably also improved the acoustics of the venue, avoiding straining the voices of actors. This provision was similar to the [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan theaters]] from the same period in England.<ref name=Henares>{{Cite web|url=http:\/\/www.corraldealcala.com\/|title=Teatro Corral de Comedias - Alcal\u00e1 de Henares|accessdate=August 2013|language=Spanish}}<\/ref> In the earlier built corrals, there were no toilets: with the advent of \"new enlightened governments\" during the reign of [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], some ''corrales'' were closed due to hygiene issues, risk of fire or disorder. With the arrival of a bourgeois class who did not want to watch the plays in awkward spaces such as these, larger theatrical structures were constructed, which required confined spaces and specific acoustic treatment.\n\n==Performances==\nDuring the Spanish Golden Age, any theatrical event was known as ''comedia''. The public came in masses for entertainments like this, whether comedy, drama or tragedy. The season of performances usually began on Easter Sunday, ending on Ash Wednesday. Smoking was forbidden because of the risk of fire, and from October to April the ''comedia'' began at two in the afternoon, in the spring at three and at four during summer, in order for all to finish before sunset. The performance's duration was approximately four to six hours, structured in six different rounds: the first act or ''[[Loa (Spanish play)|loa]]'', the opening round, then an appetizer, the second round, the masquerade or ''[[j\u00e1cara]]s'', a third round and the final act. Men and women could not sit together; men occupied the courtyard, side stands, the benches or the central stands, and the women watched the performance from their ''cazuelas'' above. The only place where they were allowed to be together was in the chamber corridors. Children were not allowed to attend. The audience paid fees at different points: at the entrance, then a tip to the \"brotherhood\" or beneficiary, and a third one for the privilege of a seat so they could watch the play comfortably. The theatrical company rarely received as much as 20% of the total. In university towns, it was forbidden to perform on weekdays, so the students would not be distracted. Two characters were instantly recognized in the ''corrales'': the ''mozo'', maintainer of order, equipped with a big [[garrote]] to calm the exited spectator, and the \"spacer\", that is, the one in charge of finding a suitable place for an individual in between two others. The first regulation on the operation of corrals was published by the Royal Council of Castile for the ''corrales'' of Madrid, later extended to the whole kingdom.<ref name=cot>{{Cite journal|last=Cotarelo y Mori|first=Emilio|year=2001|title=El corral de comedias de Almagro: construcci\u00f3n, propriedad e arrendamiento|language=Spanish|journal=Boletin de la Real Academia de la Historia|volume=CXCVIII|url=http:\/\/books.google.pt\/books?id=kkC4xH3-mZoC&pg=PA519|accessdate=August 2013}}<\/ref> Among its provisions, were the presence of a [[bailiff]] whose function was to ensure that no noise, tumults, or scandals ensued, and that men and women were kept separated in their respective seating by the required entrances and exits.<ref name=\"cot\"\/>{{sfn|Pel\u00e1ez Mart\u00edn|2002|p=n.s.}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n;Attribution\n*''This article is based on the translation of the corresponding article of the Portuguese Wikipedia.

Its western terminus is located at the [[Turcot Interchange]], a junction with [[Quebec Autoroute 15|Autoroute 15]] and [[Quebec Autoroute 20|Autoroute 20]], and its eastern terminus is near the [[Jacques Cartier Bridge]] ([[Quebec Route 134|Route 134]]), where the highway merges with [[Notre-Dame Street]]. The Autoroute Ville-Marie designation is named after the downtown [[Ville-Marie, Montreal|borough of Ville-Marie]], through which the expressway is routed.\n\nPart of A-720 runs underground (below grade) through [[Downtown Montreal]]. This section begins from the west at [[Mountain Street|Rue de la Montagne]]&nbsp;\/ [[Rue Atwater]] (exit 4) and remains underground almost all the way to its eastern end, except for a short section between Rue Bleury and [[Boulevard Saint-Laurent]]. The tunnelled section west of this gap is known as the '''Ville-Marie Tunnel''', and the section east of it is known as '''Viger Tunnel'''. However, locals regard both tunnels as one, and the term ''Ville-Marie Tunnel'' is often used to refer to both tunnels.\n\nThe [[Turcot Interchange]], which is the western terminus of A-720, is currently undergoing a reconstruction project. Once completed in 2019, the A-720 will be downgraded from an autoroute to a national highway and renumbered '''Route 136'''.<ref name=turcot\/>\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Autoroute Ville-Marie.jpg|thumb|left|230px|The Ville-Marie Expressway near [[Old Montreal]]]]\nThe [[Transports Qu\u00e9bec|provincial transport ministry]] (Le minist\u00e8re des Transports du Qu\u00e9bec, or MTQ) had planned to extend the Vigor Tunnel east to [[Quebec Autoroute 25|Autoroute 25]] at its Souligny Avenue interchange. The right-of-way has existed since the original layout of the A-720, and buildings along the extension were demolished at that time, even though the 720 was not completed due to cost constraints. The government of Montreal instead converted the portion of Rue Notre Dame east of the Jacques Cartier Bridge into a six-lane ''urban boulevard'', rather than continue a sunken limited-access expressway. The final project was approved, and work began on Souligny Avenue to double the span of the travel lanes. In late July 2009, an A-720 westbound shield that was installed on this stretch. It was originally envisioned that Autoroute 20 would extend from the [[Turcot Interchange]], along the route of the 720, to the [[Louis Hippolyte Lafontaine Bridge-Tunnel]].\n\nIn 2007, working crews for [[Transports Qu\u00e9bec]] discovered major cracks in a support pillar and closed several lanes of the expressway. Transports Quebec announced on August 10, 2007, major repair projects for a large section of the Expressway west of the Ville-Marie tunnel.<ref>[http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/canada\/montreal\/story\/2007\/08\/10\/commuter-traffic.html Repairs]<\/ref>  In addition, the full reconstruction of the Turcot Interchange in the next several years will also affect portions of the 720. As of 2012, the 720 will be renamed Route 136 at the end of the reconstruction, which is due to be late 2019.<ref name=turcot>[http:\/\/www.turcot.gouv.qc.ca\/projet\/Pages\/cartes.aspx Turcot Project](in French)<\/ref>\n\nOn July 31, 2011, part of the roof of the Ville-Marie Tunnel collapsed, sending large chunks of concrete to the road below. Fortunately, this incident occurred at a time with little traffic and no vehicles were damaged. Several construction workers were on site at the time and were unharmed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Huge concrete slab falls in Montreal expressway tunnel|url=http:\/\/ca.news.yahoo.com\/large-concrete-slab-collapses-montreal-ville-marie-tunnel-150005865.html|publisher=CBC.ca|accessdate=Aug 1, 2011}}<\/ref> The tunnel had to be closed for repair of the roof and several other parts of the tunnel.

Self-portrait in pencil from 1777 or 1778. Now in the Mozart-Museum in Salzburg.<ref>Solomon (1995, 162)<\/ref>]]\n'''Maria Anna Thekla Mozart''' (September 25, 1758 &ndash; January 25, 1841), called ''Marianne'', known as '''B\u00e4sle''' (\"little cousin\"), was the cousin of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:BoezlschiessenTargetMozartAndBaesle.PNG|thumb|left|Modern reconstruction of a target for [[B\u00f6lzlschiessen]] (dart shooting), a light entertainment of the Mozart family. It depicts a sad farewell between Marianne and Mozart in 1777.]]\nShe was born in [[Augsburg]], Germany, the third (and only surviving one) of five daughters of Franz Alois Mozart, a younger brother of [[Leopold Mozart]] and Maria Victoria Eschenbach. Between October 11 and October 26, 1777, 19-year-old Marianne met the 21-year-old Wolfgang in Augsburg. The young people developed a close, probably intimate relationship.\n\nTen letters of their subsequent correspondence have been preserved, all from Wolfgang to Marianne. These are called the \"B\u00e4sle letters\" (\"B\u00e4sle\" is a [[diminutive]] form in German, meaning \"little cousin\"). They are striking for their abundance of scatological and sexual humor. [[Maynard Solomon]] translates one passage into rhymed English as shown below (from a letter dated 23 December 1778):\n:\"Come for a bit or else I'll shit. If you do, this high and mighty person will think you very kind, will give you a smack behind, will kiss your hands, my dear, shoot off a gun in the rear, embrace you warmly, mind, and wash your front and behind, pay you all his debts to the uttermost groat, and shoot off one with a rousing note, perhaps even let something drop from his boat.\"<ref>Solomon 1995, 169. The German original, taken from [http:\/\/www.fh-augsburg.de\/~harsch\/germanica\/Chronologie\/18Jh\/Mozart\/moz_br03.html ''Die B\u00e4sle Briefe''] ({{ill|de|Bibliotheca Augustana}}), is: \"Also kommen sie gewis, sonst ist ein schys; ich werde alsdan in eigner hoherperson ihnen Complimentiren, ihnen den arsch Petschieren, ihre h\u00e4nde k\u00fcssen, mit der hintern b\u00fcchse schiessen, ihnen Embrassiren, sie hinten und vorn kristiren, ihnen, was ich ihnen etwa alles schuldig bin, haarklein bezahlen, und einen wackeren furz lassen erschallen, und vielleicht auch etwas lassen fallen.\" (Mozart's own spelling).<\/ref>\n\nAfter Mozart's return from Paris, Marianne accepted an invitation (given in the letter just quoted) to visit Mozart and his family in [[Salzburg]]. She accompanied him in January 1779 from [[Munich]] to Salzburg and stayed there for about two-and-a-half months, despite the disapproval of Mozart's father [[Leopold Mozart|Leopold]].<ref>Solomon 1995<\/ref> She may have hoped for marriage to Wolfgang. If so, her wish was shattered; the former warm relationship cooled off. Their last reunion was in Augsburg in March 1781.\n\nMarianne had been educated accordingly to her rank as citizen of the Free City of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and, as a teenager, gained further social education in Munich. She is described{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} as having been beautiful, endearing, bright, humorous, and in love with life. In 1784, she gave birth to an illegitimate daughter, Maria Josepha, whose father, [[Canon (priest)|canon]] Dr. Theodor Franz de Paula Maria Baron von Reibeld (1752\u20131807), provided generously for mother and child.\n\n[[File:Stadtfriedhof Bayreuth, Plakette Maria Anna Thekla Mozart.jpg|thumb|Memorial plate at the municipal cemetery.]]\nMarianne Mozart remained unmarried her entire life. After the death of her mother, who had been widowed in 1791, she moved to live with her daughter and son-in-law, postmaster Franz-Joseph Streitel, in 1808. Already in 1803 the only grandchild, Carl Joseph, had died in infancy. Moving to [[Kaufbeuren]] in 1812, she and her family finally ended up in [[Bayreuth]] in 1814, where she lived for 27 years until her death.\n\nFifty years after her famous cousin, Marianne died in Bayreuth, Germany, at the age of 82. In her estate, the portrait of her cousin was found, which he had sent her from Mannheim in 1778. Only 15 months later, her 58-year-old daughter died. Both were buried in the municipal cemetery in Bayreuth, but the graves can no longer be found. In the course of the years, two memorial plates were placed, one at the Old Coaching House, the other at the entrance of the municipal cemetery.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Mozart and scatology]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references \/>\n\n==References==\n* Dempf, Peter (2004) ''Mir ist so federleicht ums Herz'', Eichborn Verlag, Frankfurt\/Main.

Substantial dispute existed at the beginning among water quality regulatory agencies, dischargers, and environmental advocates over the condition of the  [[Ecology of the San Francisco Estuary|estuary]] and the importance of contamination in the decline of aquatic resources. AHI helped synthesize existing information about pollution and pollution effects for the State Water Resources Control Board D.1485 Bay Delta Hearings<ref>http:\/\/www.waterboards.ca.gov\/waterrights\/water_issues\/programs\/bay_delta\/notices\/1997\/2dec97ntc.shtml<\/ref> and for the [[San Francisco Estuary Partnership]], established through the [[Clean Water Act]]. AHI was transformed into the SFEI [[501(c)(3)]] non-profit organization in 1993 in correlation with the Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan developed in the [[San Francisco Estuary Partnership]] for a comprehensive, coordinated Regional Monitoring and Research Strategy to assess the chemical, physical and biological health of the Estuary.<ref>http:\/\/www.sfei.org\/history<\/ref>\n\n=== Current Programs ===\n\n==== Clean Water ====\nSFEI\u2019s Clean Water Program anticipates and meets the water quality data needs of policy-makers, resource managers, and the public. It helps the public, regulators, and those who discharge into our waters create more effective policies to ensure the health of our waters. The Clean Water Program consists of several programs and initiatives:\n* The Regional Monitoring Program for Water Quality in San Francisco Bay<ref>http:\/\/www.sfei.org\/programs\/what-rmp<\/ref>\n* The Delta RMP to inform better policy-making for Delta water quality\n*Nutrient Numeric Endpoints (NNE), San Francisco Bay Water Board staff has embarked on an effort working with the Southern California Water Research Program and SFEI to develop nutrient numeric endpoints for the estuary. This effort is part of a statewide initiative, supported by the U.S. EPA Region IX and the State Water Board, to address nutrient over-enrichment (eutrophication) in State waters, specifically to develop the NNE framework for streams and lakes and for California's coastal estuaries.<ref>http:\/\/www.waterboards.ca.gov\/sanfranciscobay\/water_issues\/programs\/planningtmdls\/amendments\/estuarynne.shtml<\/ref><ref>http:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/1469351?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents<\/ref>\n*Green Chemistry research in efforts to prevent pollution by advising manufacturers about safer options\n*[[The Watershed Project]]\n*Emerging Contaminants<ref>http:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/levels-of-persistent-flame-retardants-decline-in-san-francisco-bay\/<\/ref>\n\n==== Resilient Landscapes ====\nSFEI develops innovative ecosystem restoration, management and green infrastructure strategies that balance the priorities of healthy ecosystems and healthy communities.

But An Lushan's attack was far too bold and cost him almost all of his troops.\n\n\n He escape usual execution for such disobedience cases in part because of Zhang affection for him, and in part thanks to Emperor Xuanzong who -overviewing death penalty cases- believed that his audacious and mid-barbarian character should not be pay by death.[13]\n\nBack to Youzhou, he soon became the Bingmashi (\u5175\u99ac\u4f7f) of Pinglu Army (741, seventh month), cultivating carefully relationships with other officials and generals to earn praises, and bribing Imperial messengers to advantageously include him in their reports. As the consequence of this systematic bride, he was promote commandant at Yingzhou (Ying prefecture) and Jiedushi (military governor) of the Pinglu army[14] in 742 to face and defeat northern threat (Khitans, Xi, Bohai, and Heishui Mohe).[13][15] and military governor of Fanyang Circuit (\u8303\u967d, headquartered in modern Beijing) in 744, plundering Khitan and Xi villages to display his military abilities. This continuous harassment of Khitan is understand by some scholars as volunteer provocation to up the Khitan aggressiveness and threat, in the aim to get more troops from Chang'an for his future rebellion, and as the reason of the 745's Khitan-Xi rebellion.[15]\n\nAs commander of the northeastern frontier (744\u2013755), An Lushan organised military operations against the Khitan-Xi nomads. His motivation was to curry favour with the Tang court, and probably also to obtain more troops for his subsequent campaigns to defeat what he saw as the enormous threat presented by the northeastern \"babarians\", amongst whom the Khitan were the most significant. He may also have been motivated by thoughts of preparing for his future rebellion (755\u2013763).\n\n\n== Cleaning agent ==\n{{Incomplete|date=December 2007}}\n{{unreferenced|date=December 2007}}\n{{wikify|date=December 2007}}\n'''Cleaning Agents''' are substances, usually [[liquids]], that are used to remove [[bacteria]], \n[[stains]], and [[dust]]. \n\nPurposes of cleaning agents include [[health]], and to avoid the spreading of dirt and contaminants. \n\n== Uses ==\nCleaning agents are useful in cleaning Coils and Fins, and [[metals]].

It was designed and built at the [[Bell Boatyard]] on Bell's [[Beinn Bhreagh, Nova Scotia|Beinn Bhreagh]] estate near [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia]]. In 1919 it set a [[water speed record|world marine speed record]] of {{convert|70.86|mph|km\/h}}.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe March 1906 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article by American pioneer William E. Meacham explained the basic principle of [[hydrofoil]]s and [[Hydroplane (boat)|hydroplane]]s. Bell considered the invention of the hydroplane a very significant achievement.  Baldwin studied the work of the Italian inventor [[Enrico Forlanini]] and began testing models based on his designs, which led them to the development of hydrofoil watercraft. Based on information gained from that article he began to sketch concepts of what is now called a hydrofoil boat.  Bell, with his chief engineer [[Frederick W. Baldwin|Casey Baldwin]], began hydrofoil experiments in the summer of 1908. During Bell's world tour of 1910\u20131911, Bell and Baldwin met with Forlanini in Italy, where they rode in his hydrofoil boat over [[Lake Maggiore]]. Baldwin described it as being as smooth as flying. \n\nOn returning to Bell's large laboratory and boatyard at his [[Beinn Bhreagh, Nova Scotia|Beinn Bhreagh]] estate near [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia]], they experimented with a number of designs, culminating in the ''HD-4''. In 1913, Dr. Bell hired Walter Pinaud, a Sydney yacht designer and builder as well as the proprietor of Pinaud's Yacht Yard in [[Westmount, Nova Scotia|Westmount]] to work on the pontoons of the HD-4. Pinaud soon took over the [[Bell Boatyard]] at Beinn Bhreagh. Pinaud's experience in boat-building enabled him to make useful design changes to the HD-4. After the [[First World War]], work began again on the HD-4. Bell's report to the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] permitted him to obtain two {{convert|350|bhp|kW}} [[Liberty L-12]] engines in July 1919. \n\nBell and assistant [[Frederick W. Baldwin|Frederick W. \"Casey\" Baldwin]] began hydrofoil experimentation in the summer of 1908 as a possible aid to airplane takeoff from water. On September 9, 1919 on the [[Bras d'Or Lakes]] at Baddeck, the HD-4 set a [[water speed record|world marine speed record]] of {{convert|70.86|mph|km\/h}}, that stood for two decades.\n\n== Museum display ==\n\n[[File:MuseeBaddeck.JPG|thumb|The HD-4 hydrofoil at the [[Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site|Alexander Graham Bell museum]]]] \n\nA full-scale replica of Bell's HD-4 is viewable at the [[Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site|Alexander Graham Bell museum]] in [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia]], Canada.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Bras d'Or (R-103)]], a small experimental hydrofoil built for the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) during the 1950s\n* [[HMCS Bras d'Or (FHE 400)]], a hydrofoil that served in the Canadian Forces from 1968 to 1971, and the fastest unarmed warship in the world for several years\n\n== References ==\n\n; Citations\n\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{no footnotes|date=May 2012}}\n\n\n; Bibliography\n\n* {{Cite web\n  |title=Alexander Graham Bell and the Hydrofoils\n  |url=http:\/\/www.lesliefield.com\/other_history\/alexander_graham_bell_and_the_hydrofoils.htm\n}}\n* {{Cite web\n  |title=Hydrofoil\n  |url=http:\/\/www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com\/articles\/hydrofoil\n  |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia\n}}\n* {{Cite web\n  |title=Alexander Graham Bell's Hydrofoil HD4\n  |url=http:\/\/gardenofpraise.com\/agbell6.htm\n  |publisher=[http:\/\/gardenofpraise.com Garden of Praise]\n}}\n* {{Cite web\n  |title= Remaining Pieces of Bell's Original HD-4 Hydrofoil\n  |url=http:\/\/seniortravel.about.com\/od\/canadatravelphotos\/ig\/Alexander-Graham-Bell-Museum\/Interior-of-HD-4-Hydrofoil.htm\n}}\n\n{{Alexander Graham Bell}}\n{{Baddeck}}\n\n[[Category:Hydrofoils]]\n[[Category:Water speed records]]\n[[Category:Alexander Graham Bell]]\n[[Category:1919 ships]]","timestamp":"20160410101445","user-timestamp":"20150410101445"},{"title":"Talk:Norton High School (Ohio)","content":"{{WikiProject United States|class=stub|importance=Low|OH=yes|OH-importance=Low}}","timestamp":"20160410101446","user-timestamp":"20150410101446"},{"title":"User:Ambirch1\/Autograph Book","content":"==Hello, Please sign your autograph below==\n\nPlus you can leave an optional comment!\n# [[User:Ambirch1|Ambirch1]] 19:15, 6 July 2007 (UTC)\n#[[User:Djmckee1|<font color=\"Blue\" face=\"verdana\">Djmckee1<\/font>]] - [[User_talk:Djmckee1|<font color=\"SteelBlue\" face=\"verdana\">Talk<\/font>]] 05:40, 9 July 2007 (UTC)\n#[[User:Djminisite|DJminisite]] 08:21, 12 July 2007 (UTC)\n# Since you signed mine, I'll [[WP:SIG#Internal_links|sign here!]] Cheers! --[[user:teh tennisman\/welcome|<font color=\"SteelBlue\" face=\"verdana\">tennis<\/font>]][[user talk:teh tennisman|<font color=\"ForestGreen\" face=\"verdana\">man<\/font>]] 17:58, 22 July 2007 (UTC)\n#<span style=\"font-family:Comic Sans MS\">[[User:Socks 01|'''<span style=\"background:Yellow;color:Black\"> &nbsp;Socks 01&nbsp;<\/span>''']] <\/span><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman\"><\/span> 03:00, 2 September 2007 (UTC)\n#Hey, how are you?

The campaign became a siege on a fastness at Chencang from December 228 to early 229 during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period of [[History of China|Chinese history]]. The expedition concluded with Shu-Han retreat.\n\n==Background==\nIn 228, after [[Eastern Wu]] defeated Cao Wei at the [[Battle of Shiting]], Wei reinforced the east by mobilizing its troops in the west. Shu Chancellor and regent, Zhuge Liang, hoped to use this opportunity to launch an incursion into Wei territory. Before the Chancellor finalized an operation plan, [[Cao Zhen]] of Wei had distinctly anticipated Zhuge's route of advancement and recommended Hao Zhao to build fortifications for Chencang. The Supreme General, Cao Zhen, assured the young emperor [[Cao Rui]] of the defence against probable invasions from Shu. However, Hao Zhao was only assigned 1,000 men for his task. The prognosis was made after Zhuge Liang had lost the first expedition earlier that year.<ref name=\"SGZ Volume 35\">Chen Shou. ''Records of Three Kingdoms'', Volume 35, Biography of Zhuge Liang.<\/ref>\n\n==The battle==\n===Prelude===\nAfter his failure on Mount Qi and Jieting, Zhuge Liang indeed changed his target to Chencang as Cao Zhen reckoned. Thoroughly prepared, the Shu Chancellor brought with him a selection of siege weapons and an expedition force of one hundred thousand men. Although a few officers including [[Wei Yan]] recommended an alternate route, Zhuge Liang was determined to follow Jialing Valley, which emerges in the north where the Wei River widens considerably near the city of Chencang. Zhuge Liang planned to capture Chencang as a midpoint for further military actions against the great metropolis [[Chang'an]]. \n\nThe Shu army reached the fortress-city of Chencang during December 228, wherein the defense was apparently not completed as Cao Zhen had not sent additional forces to move in. Having completed the encirclement, Zhuge Liang sent Jin Xiang, a personal friend of Hao Zhao, to convince the latter to defect. The first time the two friends spoke, Hao Zhao would hear none of it, saying \"The law of Wei is what you practiced; the nature of me is what you know. I have received so much from my country and I can't let down on my family. You ought to say no more, I'll only die defending this city.<ref>(\u201c\u9b4f\u5bb6\u79d1\u6cd5\uff0c\u537f\u6240\u7ec3\u4e5f\uff1b\u6211\u4e4b\u4e3a\u4eba\uff0c\u537f\u6240\u77e5\u4e5f\u3002\u6211\u53d7\u56fd\u6069\u591a\u800c\u95e8\u6237\u91cd\uff0c\u537f\u65e0\u53ef\u8a00\u8005\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u5fc5\u6b7b\u8033\u3002\u201d). ''Brief History of Wei''.<\/ref> The lobbyist told Zhuge Liang what Hao Zhao had said, and again Zhuge sent Jin Xiang to soften the steadfast defender. \"Our armies are enormous while you only have a tiny force, what good is it to perish for a futile effort?\" said Jin Xiang outside of the city-gate. This time, however, Hao Zhao fitted an arrow and replied, \"what I said earlier remains solid. As I know you, my arrow doesn't.\"<ref>(\u4eae\u53c8\u4f7f\u8be6\u91cd\u8bf4\u662d\uff0c\u8a00\u4eba\u5175\u4e0d\u654c\uff0c\u65e0\u4e3a\u7a7a\u81ea\u7834\u706d\u3002\u662d\u8c13\u8be6\u66f0\uff1a\u201c\u524d\u8a00\u5df2\u5b9a\u77e3\u3002\u6211\u8bc6\u537f\u8033\uff0c\u7bad\u4e0d\u8bc6\u4e5f\u3002\u201d\u8be6\u4e43\u53bb\u3002). ''Brief History of Wei''.<\/ref> Upon hearing this, Zhuge commenced the offensive.\n\n===Siege===\nThe odds were drastically against Hao Zhao&mdash;he only had 1,000 men at the time, while the Shu army, numbering 100,000, had established three layers of siege.<ref name=A \/> Therefore, the Shu Chancellor aimed to take the fortress directly; he carried out an [[escalade]] tactic through the use of siege ladders, but Hao Zhao countered with fire arrows, burning the platforms and parching the men upon them. While the ladders were still aflame, Zhuge's battering rams designed to breach the city-gate had arrived, and Hao Zhao hurriedly chained some great stones and rolled them down, smashing the rams. The quick response and leadership of Hao Zhao shocked Zhuge Liang, as the latter never forejudged such a determined resistance. \n\nZhuge Liang then drew back and rethought on his tactic. Since moats made access to the walls difficult for siege weapons, which needed to be brought up against a wall to be effective, the Chancellor decided to remove the trenches to create more possible attack points. Following Zhuge's order, the besiegers started to fill the chasms and prepared their [[siege towers]]. With the ditches removed, the [[siege engines]] moved upon the castle while foot-soldiers climbed the walls like ants. However, Zhuge Liang was outwitted by Hao Zhao that when the former laid his hand on the entrenchment, the latter had already seen through his intention and started building interior walls within the boundaries of the original walls.<ref>(\u4eae\u4e43\u66f4\u4e3a\u4e95\u9611\u767e\u5c3a\u4ee5\u5c04\u57ce\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u571f\u4e38\u586b\u5811\uff0c\u6b32\u76f4\u6500\u57ce\uff0c\u662d\u53c8\u4e8e\u5185\u7b51\u91cd\u5899\u3002) ''Brief History of Wei''.<\/ref> As long as the siege towers could not pass the first walls, the soldiers on top of the towers who managed to overcome the outer walls could not climb the second inner walls. Trapped inside the two gates of walls, those soldiers who descended from the towers became easy target for archery practice. \n\nSuffering another defeat, Zhuge Liang adopted an architectural approach by asking his soldiers to dig tunnels that led to the substructure of the fortress. However, his method was actually different from the more common mining tactic, which is to excavate beneath the foundations of the walls, and then deliberately collapsing or exploding the tunnel&mdash;it is recorded that the Chancellor wanted to create some underground passages for his armies to enter the city directly in order to catch his opponent off guard.<ref>(\u4eae\u53c8\u4e3a\u5730\u7a81\uff0c\u6b32\u8e0a\u51fa\u4e8e\u57ce\u91cc\uff0c\u662d\u53c8\u4e8e\u57ce\u5185\u7a7f\u5730\u6a2a\u622a\u4e4b\u3002). ''Brief History of Wei''.<\/ref> Zhuge Liang's tactic is a much perilous approach, because defenders can counter-tunnel to cut into the attackers' works and topple them prematurely, killing anyone affected by the collapse, and that is just what Hao Zhao did.\n\nThe struggle had been continuing non-stop for 20-odd days and nights, with Zhuge Liang straining his tactics to no avail.<ref>(\u663c\u591c\u76f8\u653b\u62d2\u4e8c\u5341\u4f59\u65e5\uff0c\u4eae\u65e0\u8ba1) ''Brief History of Wei''.<\/ref> \n\nNews came of Wei reinforcements being led by Zhang He was a serious threat to Zhuge Liang, especially when the latter started to face logistic difficulty, so the Shu army retreated. Seeking glory, a Wei general, [[Wang Shuang]], led his cavalry in pursuit of the enemy to the [[Qinling Mountains]], where he fell into an ambush planted by Zhuge Liang and was killed.<ref name=\"SGZ Volume 35\" \/> On the other hand, Zhang He precisely predicted Zhuge Liang would retreat before he even arrived Chenchang, so Zhang He headed Nanzheng, but was not able to catch up with Zhuge Liang.\n\n==Aftermath==\nScoring such a victory, Hao Zhao instantly became a celebrity, and an imperial decree was passed down to grant the victor a title of marquis. Cao Rui also summoned Hao Zhao to the capital of [[Luoyang]], where the young emperor praised his general highly. However, Hao Zhao soon died of illness during his stay in the capital. \n\nIn the same year of 229, Zhuge Liang launched his third expedition. This time, he again changed his target, sending [[Chen Shi (Three Kingdoms)|Chen Shi]] to besiege Wudu and Yinping [[Commandery (China)|commanderies]].<ref name=\"SGZ Volume 35\" \/> The Wei general, [[Guo Huai]], [[Battle of Jianwei|ceded the two commanderies]] to Shu Han, in fear he would be sandwiched by Chen Shi and Zhuge Liang.\n\n==Modern references==\nThe Siege of Chencang is featured as a playable stage in the [[Dynasty Warriors 5|fifth installment]] of [[Koei]]'s video game series ''[[Dynasty Warriors 5]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{coord missing|Shaanxi}}\n\n[[Category:Battles of the Three Kingdoms|Chencang 229]]\n[[Category:220s conflicts]]\n[[Category:Sieges|Chencang]]\n[[Category:228 in China]]\n[[Category:229 in China]]\n[[Category:History of Shaanxi]]","timestamp":"20160410101457","user-timestamp":"20150410101457"},{"title":"Harras","content":"{{Infobox Album <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Albums -->\n| Name        = Harras\n| Type        = [[Live Album]]\n| Artist      = [[Derek Bailey (guitarist)|Derek Bailey]], [[John Zorn]] & [[William Parker (musician)|William Parker]]\n| Cover       = Harras (Bailey-Zorn-Parker album - cover art).jpg\n| Released    = January 30, 1996\n| Recorded    = 1993\n| Genre       = [[Avant-garde]]\n| Length      = 57:34\n| Label       = [[Avant records|Avant]] <small>Avan 056\n| Producer    = [[Derek Bailey (guitarist)|Derek Bailey]] & [[John Zorn]]\n| Chronology  = [[John Zorn]]\n| Last album  = ''[[Masada: Vav]]''<br>(1995)\n| This album  = '''''Harras'''''<br\/>(1995)\n| Next album  = ''[[John Zorn's Cobra: Tokyo Operations '94]]''<br>(1995)\n}}\n'''''Harras''''' is an album of [[improvised music]] by [[Derek Bailey (guitarist)|Derek Bailey]], [[John Zorn]] & [[William Parker (musician)|William Parker]].

His research established that [[dendritic cells]] are responsible for imprinting the tissue-specific homing of [[T lymphocytes]]. He is currently Executive Director of Fundacion Ciencia para la Vida (FCV),<ref>[http:\/\/www.cienciavida.cl\/] Fundacion Ciencia Para la Vida<\/ref> a non profit institution that carries out scientific and technological research. He is Immunology Professor at the [[University of Chile]]<ref>[http:\/\/www.ciencias.uchile.cl\/ciencias\/departamentos_academicos_ficha.php?codAcademico=107&codCategoria=1&imageField.x=23&imageField.y=5] Faculty of Sciences, University of Chile<\/ref> and [[Universidad Nacional Andres Bello]]<ref>[http:\/\/www.mrc.cl\/~fcplvcl\/detail.php?id=120] Merit Award Universidad Nacional Andres Bello<\/ref> (Santiago, Chile) and Adjunct Professor at [[Dartmouth Medical School]].\n\n==Biography==\nMario Rosemblatt earned his Ph.D. degree in immunology at Wayne State University. He has been Research Fellow in Medicine at [[Harvard University]] (1973) joining the group of Dr. [[Edgar Haber]], Assistant Professor at [[Brown University]] (1976), Investigator at the [[Boston Biomedical Research Institute]] (1978) and the Association Against Cancer in France (1981).  In 1983, he returned to Chile and joined the Faculty of Sciences at the [[University of Chile]]. He was Chairman of the Biology Department and Director of the team that established the degree in Biotechnology at the University of Chile, acting as the first Director of this program. In 1997 he joined the Fundaci\u00f3n Ciencia para la Vida acting as its first Executive Director.\n\n==Research==\nDuring his years at the Boston Biomedical Research Institute Dr. Rosemblatt was the first to publish a report on the use of [[monoclonal antibody]] technology to study muscle physiology. The main aspects of his research deals with studies related to the function of regulatory [[T cells]]. His team has demonstrated that although B cells and dendritic cells can generate regulatory T cells by themselves, a mixture of both antigen-presenting cells improves their capacity to efficiently generate regulatory T cells. He also has established that gut dendritic cells are responsible for the production of [[retinoic acid]] and therefore for the induction of a tolerogenic environment in the gut.<ref>[http:\/\/diario.latercera.com\/2010\/08\/09\/01\/contenido\/tendencias\/16-34960-9-chilenos-crean-celulas-que-evitan-el-rechazo-de-organos.shtml] La Tercera<\/ref> As an immunologist he participated in the development of a salmon vaccine \u2013presently in the market, licensed to Novartis- against the ''Pitsireckettsia salmonis'' a deadly pathogen that affects the salmon industry in Chile. <br>\nMario Rosemblatt is a member of the American Association of Immunologists, of the Transplantation Society, of the Chilean Society for Cell Biology and the Chilean Society of Immunology.\n\n==Publications==\n\n===Selection of Papers===\n* J\u00f8rgensen TN, Alfaro J, Enriquez HL, Jiang C, Loo WM, Atencio S, Bupp MR, Mailloux CM, Metzger T, Flannery S, Rozzo SJ, Kotzin BL, Rosemblatt M., Bono MR, Erickson LD.

Pentacle uses a teaching approach that makes innovative use of virtual technologies<ref>The Daily Telegraph, Thursday 25 June 1998<\/ref> coupled with a unique curriculum of practical business tools.\n\nThe UK office is at Burke Lodge (also known as Burke House), a landmark 16th century [[coaching inn]]<ref>Beaconsfield Old Town Conservation Area Character Appraisal, November 2007, South Bucks Council<\/ref> in [[Beaconsfield]], Buckinghamshire, England. Pentacle also has offices in France, the USA, Ireland, the Netherlands and South Africa.\n\n== History ==\nPentacle was established in 1992 by [[Eddie Obeng]] described by the [[Financial Times]] as \"a leading revolutionary\"<ref>Financial Times, Friday 12 July 1996<\/ref> and by [[Abbey National]] as their \"secret weapon\".<ref>Development and Learning in Organizations: An International Journal, Volume 16, Number 1, 2002 , pp. 4\u20136(3)<\/ref> It moved to its current premises, Burke Lodge, in [[Beaconsfield]] in 1994 and hosted its first training event on [[Project Management]] for Nuclear Electric (now part of [[British Energy]]) later that year. At the same time, Pentacle started to develop virtual reality business games on the now redundant Superscape platform <ref>http:\/\/www.ukbusinesspark.co.uk\/sue02685.htm<\/ref> and used LearningSpace & Notes 3.0 from Lotus (now [[IBM]]) to deliver the first virtual business education sessions for [[Motorola]].  The following year Pentacle taught Lotus how to use its own product for delivering virtual learning. By 2003, Pentacle had established offices in France and, a year later in the Netherlands and South Africa; in 2009, Pentacle launched in Ireland.\n\n== Teaching approach ==\nObeng developed the core principle that underpins the work of the organisation: ''that the rate of change in the world now exceeds our ability to learn''. As a result, the traditional structures and processes for doing business (the \"Old World\") have become ineffective. Success in an environment where the pace of change exceeds our ability to learn (the \"New World\") can only come if businesses adopt new ways of learning and implementing that knowledge. This is perhaps best summarised by [[Eric Hoffer]]\u201fs reflection that \"In a time of drastic change it is the learners who inherit the future. The learned usually find themselves equipped to live in a world that no longer exists\".<ref>Eric Hoffer, Reflections on the Human Condition [32], 1973<\/ref>\n\nPentacle demystifies traditional business school teaching to remove unnecessary theory and focus on practical tools that can be applied in the real world in \"a continuous link between learning and implementation\".<ref>Finance and Management, July 2000<\/ref> It uses teaching techniques that ensure that skills are learned and can be applied immediately,<ref>Roger Trapp, Financial Director 2 Jun 2004<\/ref><ref>[http:\/\/books.google.co.uk\/books?id=ifCmWeOgvQsC&pg=PA166&dq=new+rules+for+the+new+world+eddie+obeng&lr=#v=onepage&q=new%20rules%20for%20the%20new%20world%20eddie%20obeng&f=false]<\/ref> The approach has been published in the Gower Handbook of Management <ref>[http:\/\/books.google.co.uk\/books?id=LNkS_tUPHtUC&pg=PR24&dq=new+rules+for+the+new+world+eddie+obeng&lr=#v=onepage&q=new%20rules%20for%20the%20new%20world%20eddie%20obeng&f=false]<\/ref>\n\nThe Pentacle teaching approach is divided into five stages that are based around [[David A. Kolb]]'s [[experiential learning]] styles.\n*'''Engage''', to build trust with the client and understand their needs\n*'''Diagnose''', to establish the key \u2018levers\u2019 the management team need to seize to make an opportunity work and\/or to find the root cause\/ barriers to turn-around.\n*'''Design''', to work out how to re-align the management team\u2019s active or perhaps frenetic daily-life in order to \u2018insert\u2019 the learning required to transform it.\n*'''Implement''', to deliver the learning and support its application around both hard (process) and soft (people) issues.\n*'''Embed''', to remove the barriers to the new learning taking hold.\n\n==Research, education and knowledge==\n\n===Pentacle PETs (Performance Enhancement Tools)===\nPentacle uses a range of tools to support managers to operate more effectively.

The project was designed to have a friendly and helpful environment to support any unfortunate Wikipedians that have become victims of incivility, hostility, or continual disrespect.\n\nWe currently need help in getting going, and making the community understand our aims. We work for '''civility'''. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nIf you have ideas, let us know at our talk page, or on the IRC channel.

I, and all the members of the ex-council, wish to welcome new members to the group. We are a group who aim to promote remaining civil, in an environment where messages can easily be interpretated wrongly.\n\n====''Help out now!''====\n*Try and help people remain civil! Talk to them, and help them in any way possible. Do not be afraid to use the [[WT:CCD|talk page]].\n*Give people the [[:Image:Civility_barnstar.png|Civility Barnstar]].\n*Make and spread some Wikitokens so people know there are people to help if they want assistance.\n*Add banners or logos to your userpage to show your support.\n*'''Suggest some ideas!''' Add 'em to the [[WT:CCD|talk page]].\nWe are a community, so can only work though community contributions and support. It's the helping that counts.\n\n====''Decision Making''====\nThe council expired one month ago, but due to the current position of the group the current council will remain until the position of the group can be assessed, and whether it would be sensible to keep Concordia going. For most decisions, however, it will be decided by all who choose to partake in discussions. I am trying to relaunch because of the vast amounts of new members we have received, demonstrating that the aims are supported.\n\nIf you wish to opt of of further talk-page communications, just let us know [[Wikipedia:Concordia\/Do Not Spam|here]].\n\n- [[User:Ian13|<span style=\"color:#067\"><u>Ian<\/u>\u00b9\u00b3<\/span>]][[User talk:Ian13|<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps\">\/t<\/span>]] 20:29, 13 December 2006 (UTC).

Three main roads run through the ward from north to south - Landor Road in the east, Clapham Road in the centre, and Wandsworth Road in the west. The ward is named Larkhall because Larkhall Rise, then Larkhall Lane runs through the middle of it.\n\nLarkhall contains three schools: Larkhall Infants and Junior School, St Andrew\u2019s School and Lansdowne School.  There is a police station on the corner of Union Grove and Smedley Street, and Lambeth Hospital is on Landor Road.\n\nThe main Lambeth Housing estates are Fenwick, Springfield, Larkhall, Clapham Road, Patmore and Gaskell Street. Stockwell Gardens and the three imposing towers of Grantham Road are run by Hyde Southbank housing association.\n\nThe 2001 Census showed that Larkhall has a population of approximately 14,000 people, with 10,000 registered electors. A large proportion of its population was born outside of the EU. There are a large proportion of young adults aged between 16 and 24, with a high level of economic activity. Larkhall has a high rate of people aged 0\u201315 with long-term limiting illness. Larkhall has a high proportion of older people not living alone, and not in a couple.

Levin was selected to coordinate development of the new National Broadband Plan. He worked on the plan from 2009-2010. Levin said that said the plan's logical course will be one that \"unleashes forces that quicken that cycle or removes forces that slow down that cycle.\" Levin was speaking to telecom executives and lobbyists at a meeting of the Udwin Breakfast Group in Washington, D.C. At broadband policy workshops in August, several Tier 1 carriers, including T-Mobile USA and Verizon Wireless, argued for more licensed spectrum to keep pace with customers' bandwidth demands, especially for mobile broadband. When asked whether the FCC would be working with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and the White House to find ways of more efficiently using or reallocating spectrum used by federal agencies, Levin said that there was a distinct possibility that could happen. The FCC had been charged by Congress to present a national broadband plan by February. Levin said the plan will not be \"self-executing,\" and that Congress and state and local governments likely will have to get involved to execute it. He brought to light his involvement with the Obama transition team and he offered a first-time public comment on how the broadband plan is developing. At the Minority Media and Telecommunications Council\u2019s (MMTC) Broadband and Social Justice Summit in January, said that six words suffice when speaking on how to complete the transition to the digital age \u201cAbandon yesterday\u2019s logic; quickly and passionately\u201d.  According to an FCC statement, Levin headed to a job over at the Aspen Institute think tank.","timestamp":"20160410101525","user-timestamp":"20150410101525"},{"title":"User:Derekdoyle19","content":"derekdoyle","timestamp":"20160410101525","user-timestamp":"20150410101525"},{"title":"Category talk:NASCAR races in New Jersey","content":"{{WikiProject NASCAR}}\n{{WikiProject New Jersey}}","timestamp":"20160410101526","user-timestamp":"20150410101526"},{"title":"User talk:92.6.169.112","content":"\n\n== April 2013 ==\n[[Image:Information.svg|left|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia.

[[User:Ellsworth|Ellsworth]] 23:01, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)\n\n== Atwater\/Rove\/Bush connection ==\n\nDropped this sentence:\n\n:During that election, Atwater was assigned a \"minder\" by the Bush campaign, [[George W. Bush]]. The younger Bush's political strategist, [[Karl Rove]], would later employ Atwater's [[dirty tricks]] tactics against [[John McCain]] in the [[2000]] Republican primary.\n\nThis has been disputed, please cite sources if it is to be in the article. [[User:Ellsworth|Ellsworth]] 20:37, 16 July 2005 (UTC)\n\n:I've restored some of this material, with clarifications. It's well known that Atwater was a political mentor and personal friend of Karl Rove, but their relationship actually predates the 1988 presidential campaign by more than 15 years. According to ''Time'' magazine (December 20, 1999), Atwater \"ran Rove's successful campaign to become president of the College Republicans in 1973.\" ''Boy Genius,'' the biography of Rove by Lou Dubose, Jan Reid and Carl M. Cannon, also offers details about their friendship and notes allegations of Rove's involvement in dirty tricks dating back to the 1970s. (See, for example, pages 10-12.) The fact that George W. Bush had an office across the hall from Lee Atwater so that he could serve as a \"minder\" during the 1988 presidential campaign has also been reported in a number of places, including the ''Austin American-Statesman'' (February 21, 1999).\n\n:I've left out the specific reference to dirty tricks against McCain in 2000. Atwater was long dead by then, and although he was a mentor of Karl Rove during his lifetime, it doesn't seem accurate to suggest that Atwater was the mastermind of every dirty trick with which Rove or others have been associated. He's only responsible for the activities that he himself planned and undertook. --[[User:Sheldon Rampton|Sheldon Rampton]] 07:52, 17 July 2005 (UTC)\n\n::That looks good. [[User:Ellsworth|Ellsworth]] 23:45, 18 July 2005 (UTC)\n\ni was reading President George H. W. Bush's daily daily diary on the day Iraq invaded Kuwait. (http:\/\/web2.millercenter.org\/ghb\/documents\/presidential_papers\/ghb_diary_series\/1990\/ghb_1990_08.pdf) i was just curious to see exactly when he got the call, and how things sprung into action. i noticed that a few times that day, and the next day, the president would call his doctor; which i thought was strange during an international crisis. Then i saw that at 10:30am on August 6 1990, the president went to George Washington University Hospital.\n\n 10:35  10:44  The President met with Mr. Atwater,\n                 who is undergoing treatment for cancer.\n\n: Then i realized why he was calling his doctor. i had to come here to see who Lee Atwater was, and if he survived. Obviously there was some personal connection with George H. W. Bush[[User:Pauladin|Pauladin]] ([[User talk:Pauladin|talk]]) 16:41, 16 March 2013 (UTC)\n\n== Lead paragraph ==\n\nI've taken out the references to Terry McAuliffe and James Carville that an anonymous user keeps trying to add to the lead paragraph. Atwater was a Republican party strategist and a personal friend and mentor of both Karl Rove and George W. Bush. He was not a friend and mentor of McAuliffe or Carville. The anonymous user seems to be trying to insert a sort of \"forced balance\" into the lead that is actually POV rather than documentable fact. It may or may not be the case that McAuliffe and Carville use similar methods, but it is definitely ''not'' the case that they learned their political skills under his tutelage.\n\nIf other people find the current version unsatisfactory, I would suggest removing the entire sentence that begins, \"Though Atwater died in 1991...\" His relationship with Rove and Bush is described with greater precision elsewhere in the article anyway, and I don't think it needs to be part of the lead paragraph. --[[User:Sheldon Rampton|Sheldon Rampton]] 06:23, 20 August 2005 (UTC)\n\n== Incongruous ==\n\nThis paragraph is incongruous:\n\n\"Atwater not only torpedoed enemies, he often made efforts to damage or destroy Republicans as well. Ed Rollins, who managed Ronald Reagan's 1984 re-election campaign, tells several Atwater stories in his 1996 book, \"Bare Knuckles And Back Rooms.\" According to Rollins, Atwater ran a dirty tricks operation in 1984 against Vice-Presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro. This included the accurate allegation that Ferraro's parents had been indicted - but never convicted (this fact, of course, went unmentioned)- of numbers running in the 1940s. Ferraro disappeared for a few days to 'recover' from the accusation. Rollins also described Atwater as 'ruthless', 'Ollie North in civilian clothes,' and one who 'just had to drive in one more stake.'\"\n\n\nThe lead sentence states that Atwater used his \"dirty tricks\" against Republican candidates as well, and then goes on in the rest of the paragraph to talk about a particular dirty trick agains't Geraldine Ferraro, not only a Democrat, but a potential Democratic Vice-President of the United States. --[[User:B. Phillips|B. Phillips]] 22:00, 20 September 2005 (UTC)\n\n== NPOV ==\n\nThis article needs to be more balanced.  It make Atwater out to be a total monster, which he wasn't.  --[[User:Rogerd|rogerd]] 01:26, 19 February 2006 (UTC)\n:That's debatable. [[User:Raul654|Raul654]] 01:38, 19 February 2006 (UTC)\n\nI don't think there's any untruths in there. He did some horrible things and admitted it when he faced death. Maybe if you had some suggestions instead of just an opinion, your NPOV tag might have some merit. [[User:Googuse|googuse]] 02:44, 19 February 2006 (UTC)\n:I agree with Googuse on this one. Unless you have some specific problem with what the article says, the NPOV tag should come down. \"It's anti-GOP\" is not even close. Just because you don't like what the article says doesn't mean it's biased - I'm sure there are plenty of Germans out there who don't care for what the [[Holocaust]] article says, but that doesn't make it biased either. [[User:Raul654|Raul654]] 02:47, 19 February 2006 (UTC)\n::Oh, so now you are comparing Atwater with Hitler?  That seems a little over the top.  Atwater's tactics were not a lot different that [[James Carville]]'s.  --[[User:Rogerd|rogerd]] 03:00, 19 February 2006 (UTC)\n:::Would you care to substantiate that? Show me a single instance where Carville did anything like the tactics Atwater used. \n:::Furthermore, you have not yet answered the question put to you (by both Googuse and myself) to show a single factually inaccurate or otherwise biased section of this article. [[User:Raul654|Raul654]] 03:31, 19 February 2006 (UTC)\n:::Oh, and lastly - if you read my statement, you'll notice I did not compare Atwater and Hitler; I said *your* tactic of saying \"I don't like this article so therefore it must be biased\" is flatly wrong. [[User:Raul654|Raul654]] 03:32, 19 February 2006 (UTC)\n: How about the third sentence:  ''\"Atwater is notorious as the very definition of smashmouth politics, in which every effort is made to destroy the reputations, careers and lives of political opponents.\"''  If that isn't POV, I don't know what is.  --[[User:Rogerd|rogerd]] 03:43, 19 February 2006 (UTC)\n::Then how exactly should it be rephrased? The fact of the matter is that he practiced smashmouth politics (extensively), invented many (if not most) of the techniques, and then tutored today's practioners like Karl Rove. [[User:Raul654|Raul654]] 03:55, 19 February 2006 (UTC)\n:::It should be removed.  That is your opinion.  The very term \"smashmouth politics\" is inherently POV.  --[[User:Rogerd|rogerd]] 03:39, 20 February 2006 (UTC)\n\nAnything can be inherently POV if you disagree with the answer! \"Smashmouth\" is exactly what the southern strategy was about. It's well known in political circles and Atwater was the architect who was most successful in deploying it. Furthermore, I think you're being willingly obtuse in your methods of obfuscation. [[Special:Contributions\/67.183.122.227|67.183.122.227]] ([[User talk:67.183.122.227|talk]]) 20:21, 11 June 2009 (UTC)La-Tonia Denise Willis\n\n== Relationship to Nixon ==\n\nI am fairly sure it is inaccurate to characterize Atwater as a \"trusted advisor\" to President Nixon.  According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution obituary of March 29, 1991, he was a South Carolina delegate to the RNC in 1972, then executive director of the College Republicans for a year before returning to South Carolina in 1974 to establish a political consulting firm at the age of 23.  In any event, Atwater must have been far too young to have held a position of any importance in the Nixon White House.\n\n== 1981 interview with Bob Herbert issue ==\n\nIs there any other source for the \"Nigger, nigger, nigger...\" quote Bob Herbert attributed to Atwater from a 1981 interview? It seems extremely suspect to me. Why would Atwater have said that to Herbert, who he had to know wasn't sympathetic to it? Why would he have said it in a 1981 interview, when he remained unrepentant about cynical tactics until his tumor in 1990? And why would Herbert have kept it to himself until 2005? It seems at least as likely to me that Herbert just made it up, knowing that he couldn't be contradicted.\n\n:In the 2005 column in question, Bob Herbert is not quoting from his own interview with Atwater. The quote comes from the book, ''Southern Politics in the 1990s'', by Alexander P. Lamis, a political-science professor at Case Western Reserve University. --[[User:Sheldon Rampton|Sheldon Rampton]] 07:32, 12 May 2006 (UTC)\n\n::I see. But even the book wasn't published until 1999, correct? And it remains an unsubstantiated (and unable to be substantiated) equivalent of a hearsay quote. We can't be sure that it wasn't just invented. I don't think it belongs here; at the very least it should be treated skeptically.\n:::Well, without the benefit of a time machine, it would be rather difficult to write a book about politics in the 1990s and publish it much earlier than 1999. [[User:Raul654|Raul654]] 21:07, 13 May 2006 (UTC)\n:::Furthermore, as it is in a reputable source by a reputable author, I see no reason it should not be included, because so far there has not been a cintilla of evidence offered to show that Lamis made it up. [[User:Raul654|Raul654]] 21:11, 13 May 2006 (UTC)\n\n::::The timing curiosity is for the Atwater quote alone, obviously. From 1981 to 1999 is an improbable delay for the revelation of such a damning and politically consequential confession. It is the absence of any evidence at all, other than the word of the author, which should merit our skepticism. There were many other people who worked with Atwater and must have been aware of this strategy in order for it to have been implimented. This can't be the only time he admitted this to someone if it is true. Verification should be available this way, but the quote stands in isolation. If it must be included, this weakness ought to be made known.\n:::::\"There were many other people who worked with Atwater and must have been aware of this strategy in order for it to have been implimented.\" - And have any of these people actually denied the veracity of the quote? Surely if it were not true, someone would have. If not, then I see no reason why it cannot be included. [[User:Raul654|Raul654]] 21:52, 13 May 2006 (UTC)\n::::::I don't know if anyone has denied it. I wasn't even aware of the quote before reading this wiki entry. But that's an extremely weak standard of proof, especially given the seriousness of the topic. Why should we expect people to have come forward just to say they they didn't know anything about it? It would prove nothing. After all, not hearing something said doesn't mean it wasn't said. We would only expect people who had heard Atwater say such a thing to feel that coming forward was worth anyone's interest. It appears that no one has, unless you know otherwise. Given this, I think the quote should be treated with a healthy skepticism. If it must be included, so should the qualification that it is unverified and suspect.\n:::::::It's written in a book by a legitimate author and legitimate publishing house. Presumably, neither wants to get sued and will not simply make things up. To that end, I am willing to accept it on its face as being true, pending an actual claim that it is not. Other than raw speculation (\"that doesn't sound like something Atwater would say\"), you have not offered a bit of evidence to show it is false. You claim it is suspect - who, exactly, besides you actually claims it is suspect? [[User:Raul654|Raul654]] 03:43, 14 May 2006 (UTC)\n::::::::The man had been dead for 14 years. There was no risk of a lawsuit. The onus cannot be on me to disprove this. I cannot prove he did not say it. No one can prove a negative. I think it is common sense which claims it is suspect. I don't know if it is true. I'm not demanding its removal. I'm saying it shouldn't be presented as fact. (as an aside, unless the quote comes from the intro or the conclusion to the Lamis book, Lamis didn't write it; the book is a compilation of chapters by seperate authors which Lamis edited)\n\n:::::::::I don't know what the basis is for the quote in the book. Since it is a scholarly work, I imagine the book will have footnotes indicating the basis for the quote. It's quite possible that the source was an interview with Atwater that was published at the time in a newspaper or other journal that is obtainable in print form but which is not available on the internet. I did a LexisNexis search and couldn't find this quote mentioned prior to the Lamis book, but even LexisNexis doesn't have much in its archives from the 1980s. Given that the source is a respected academic with no history of fabrication, I think that if anyone here wishes to challenge the authenticity of the quote, the onus should be on them to actually look up the quote in the book itself and determine what source is being cited there. If it turns out to be merely someone's recollection 14 years after the fact, I would agree that it should be considered questionable. If, however, the source turns out to be an interview with Atwater that was published during his lifetime, I think it should be considered definitive. --[[User:Sheldon Rampton|Sheldon Rampton]] 04:46, 15 May 2006 (UTC)\n\n::::::::::That's reasonable. Thank you. I'll look into it.\n\nI found a copy of ''Southern Politics in the 1990s'' by Alexander P. Lamis at the UMCP library. Here's the context for the quote from page 7-8 (written in Chapter 1, by Lamis).\n\n'''As the party began to build at the state level, driven by white reaction to the end of segregation, the party made its most faithful converts among those attracted by its conservative position on New Deal-type economic class issues.  But it also picked up substantial support from white Democrats angered by their national party\u2019s \u201cbetrayal\u201d on the race issue.  Twisted into the situation was the logical compatibility of conservative economic-class Republicanism with the racial protest.  The GOP, as the party philosophically opposed to an activist federal government in economic matters, gained adherents also from those who objected to federal intervention in the racial affairs of the states.  The two streams of protests could not be easily separated in the public arena, and the Republican candidates, who recognized that they were beneficiaries of both prongs of reaction, rarely made the effort.'''\n\n'''The best exposition of the subtle merger of these twin forces was offered by South Carolinian Lee Atwater eight years before he became chairman of the Republican National Committee after serving as the architect of George Bush\u2019s 1988 presidential election victory.  It came during an interview while he was a member of President Ronald Reagan\u2019s White House political staff:'''\n\n'''Atwater: As to the whole Southern strategy that Harry Dent and others put together in 1968, opposition to the Voting Rights Act would have been a central part of keeping the South.  Now [the new Southern Strategy of Ronald Reagan] doesn\u2019t have to do that.  All you have to do to keep the South is for Reagan to run in place on the issues he\u2019s campaigned on since 1964\u2026 and that\u2019s fiscal conservatism, balancing the budget, cut taxes, you know, the whole cluster\u2026'''\n\n'''Questioner: But the fact is, isn\u2019t it, that Reagan does get to the Wallace voter and to the racist side of the Wallace voter by doing away with legal services, by cutting down on food stamps\u2026?'''\n\n'''Atwater: You start out in 1954 by saying, 'Nigger, nigger, nigger.' By 1968 you can't say 'nigger' - that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights and all that stuff. You're getting so abstract now [that] you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites.'''\n\n'''And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me - because obviously sitting around saying, 'We want to cut this,' is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than 'Nigger, nigger.''''\n\nThis makes more sense. Atwater was talking about his effort to dilute or abstract race from the Republican Party's appeal in the South. He was talking about Reagan's \"New Southern Strategy\".\n\n--[[User:130.85.194.154|130.85.194.154]] 22:11, 18 July 2006 (UTC)\n\n:\"Atwater was talking about his effort to dilute or abstract race from the Republican Party's appeal in the South.\"    \n\n:What a disingenuous attempt at whitewashing!  Atwater may have convinced himself and a few gullible others through this superficial proclamation of innocence, but let's look carefully at his words.  He is openly admitting that an appeal to racist voters was central to the original Southern Strategy.  He then simply states  that appeals to racism have become less overt, more coded, and their effects more roundabout.  There is nothing here that suggests his goal was to actually lessen racism, only that he was aware that it could not be appealed to as directly as before.  He then throws a sop to potentially hostile readers\/listeners by putting forward a deceitful, silly piece of false logic:  \"... I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other.\"  Simply speaking about something less directly, while leaving motivations and ideology unchanged, is not changing anything!  This is only the statement of a consummate propagandist trying to placate his conscience and create the illusion of purer motives. \n:-- [[User:Heavenlyblue|Heavenlyblue]] ([[User talk:Heavenlyblue|talk]]) 22:09, 6 May 2011 (UTC)\n\n::::This section shouldn't have been removed.

More space was given to it than to Atwater's actual tactics during campaigns (in other words, what he's famous for), his music career, or his deathbed apology, and since he doesn't ever say in any of the attributed quotes that he engaged in that type of alleged misbehavior, like the above editor, I don't see the particular relevance to this article.--[[User:Gloriamarie|Gloriamarie]] ([[User talk:Gloriamarie|talk]]) 02:55, 5 April 2008 (UTC)\n\n::It was ethically unsound to remove this section.  This is a credible quote from a credible source and goes to the heart of what Lee Atwater did in his political life.  If it's good enough for Paul Burka at Texas Monthly [http:\/\/www.texasmonthly.com\/blogs\/burkablog\/?p=336], it should be good enough for Wikipedia.  From Justice Bradley's decision in the Civil Rights Cases (1883) to Karl Rove's New Southern Strategy -- this quote sheds light on an important aspect of American political history.  Censorship makes it no less existent and relevant to the making of Lee Atwater and his influence on American political life.\n\n--[[User:Eamartinez|Eamartinez]] ([[User talk:Eamartinez|talk]]) 20:08, 14 April 2008 (UTC)\n\n== Oh, the irony ==\n\n`Though no credible evidence has been uncovered, the \"whisper campaign\" that damaged McCain's chances in that state is often attributed to Karl Rove.'  Isn't that, in and of itself, a weasel-worded whisper campaign against Karl Rove? Citation, please. [[User:Dricherby|Dricherby]] 10:26, 11 August 2007 (UTC)\n\nThere were eventually citations inserted, but none of them mentioned Atwater as inspiring this incident or having anything to do with it (he had been dead for many years at the time, so it's not likely that such citations exist in any case). I have therefore removed that section. It should, at best, be in Rove's, Bush's, or McCain's articles, not this one.--[[User:Gloriamarie|Gloriamarie]] ([[User talk:Gloriamarie|talk]]) 02:52, 5 April 2008 (UTC)\n\n== Strom Thurmond ==\n\nI think it is misleading to describe Strom Thurmond as a segregationist in this article.  Although technically correct, it implies that he was still campaigning on this issue in the 1970s.  Suggest omitting the word or stating \"who ran for president in 1948 as a segregationist\".  [[User:The Four Deuces|The Four Deuces]] ([[User talk:The Four Deuces|talk]]) 16:03, 11 November 2008 (UTC)\n\n==Atwater in Hell?==\nAccording to the documentary about him called 'Boogie Man', Atwater's motivation for the apologies rendered as he lay dying was his fear that he was bound for Hell. Given the near monopoly on christian fundamentalism claimed by the clients of Atwater and his protege\u00e9 Karl Rove, the irony of this is something too precious not to appreciate; it speaks to the idea that those believing in christianity frequently violate the very principles of that religion when engaged in politics, and for the stated reason of advancing the very principles they violate while doing so. I think it bears mentioning, but since I do not know how to make the appropriate citation, I was wondering if someone here can show me how to cite a movie like Boogie Man as the source before I make the posting.

Turnipseed was proud of having joined the NAACP to atone for his segregationist past. The article would be more accurate if \"convince\" was replaced by inform. No new reference is needed since reference 13, Turnipseed's Wash Post article, uses \"inform.\" My original source for this is Turnipseed himself (personal communication, 12-28-08).\n<p>\nAdditional note: in the following reference in the Daily Game Cock (USC student newspaper) Turnipseed talks about his involvement with the NAACP since 1973.

It was published over 25 issues from December 1985 to December 1987.  The story follows [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] continuity as closely as possible from the inception of the Marvel Universe, and it is stated in the first issue that there is nothing in the series that hasn't already been printed in previous Marvel comics.  The illustration of the comics was mostly made up from excerpts from the original comics in which the events being described took place, with the addition of some new artwork to describe some of the events mentioned.\n\nThe series was meant to be a cohesive and quick way for newcomers to catch up on the entirety of the Marvel Universe at once, featuring the stories of the biggest and most important events in the Universe (up to 1987), including origins of most of the major Marvel characters.  It also allows readers to see how stories from many different series are related and how they fit together in [[chronological]] order.  Since the series ended in 1987, many more important events and facts have been introduced that may affect the stories told in the series, but it still represents the basic early storyline of the Marvel Universe.\n\n== Spin-offs ==\n\nSubsequent releases from Marvel have followed the ''Marvel Saga'' format. ''Wolverine Saga'', a four-part mini-series published from September, 1989 to December, 1989,<ref>http:\/\/www.comics.org\/series\/3866\/<\/ref> detailed the history of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] up to that time. ''Spider-Man Saga'', another four issue series, was released from November, 1991 to February, 1992<ref>http:\/\/www.comics.org\/series\/32585\/<\/ref> and did the same thing for [[Spider-Man]].\n\nBeginning in 2006, Marvel released several ''Marvel Saga''-style [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]]s for their titles. The list of these books are:\n\n*''[[Astonishing X-Men]] Saga'' (March, 2006)\n*''Saga of [[Squadron Supreme (Supreme Power)|Squadron Supreme]]'' (April, 2006)\n*''[[Skrull Kill Krew]] Saga''* (2006)\n*''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]] Saga'' (May, 2007)\n*''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]] Saga'' (July, 2007)\n*''[[Ultimates]] Saga'' (December, 2007)\n*''[[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]] Saga''* (May, 2008)\n*''[[Secret Invasion]] Saga'' (May, 2008)\n*''[[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] Saga''* (June, 2008)\n*''[[Deadpool]] Saga''* (July, 2008)\n*''Marvel: Your Universe Saga'' (October, 2008)\n*''[[X-Infernus]] Saga''* (October, 2008)\n*''[[Franklin Richards]] Saga''* (November, 2008)\n*''[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] Saga''* (December, 2008)\n*''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] By [[Ed Brubaker]] Saga'' (December, 2008)\n*''March on [[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]] Saga'' (December, 2008)\n*''[[Punisher]] Saga''* (December, 2008)\n*''[[War of Kings]] Saga'' (February, 2009)\n*''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] Saga''* (March, 2009)\n*''Wolverine Saga'' (May, 2009)\n*''[[New Mutants]] Saga'' (June, 2009)\n*''[[Spider-Woman]] Saga''* (August, 2009)\n*''[[Moon Knight]] Saga'' (November, 2009)\n*''[[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]] Saga''* (March, 2010)\n*''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] Forever Saga''* (March, 2010)\n*''Amazing Spider-Man: [[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|Grim Hunt]] - The Kraven Saga'' (May, 2010)\n*''[[X-Men]]: [[Curse of the Mutants]] Saga'' (August, 2010)\n*''All-New Wolverine Saga'' (October, 2010)\n*''Spider-Man Saga'' (December, 2010)\n*''[[Iron Man]] 2.0 Saga''* (March, 2011)\n*''The Mighty [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] Saga'' (June, 2011)\n\n<nowiki>*<\/nowiki> Online only\n\nIn January, 2012, Marvel published a one-shot comic titled ''History of the Marvel Universe'', which provided an overview of the past 50 years of Marvel history in the ''Marvel Saga'' format.\n\n==Collected editions==\nThe series has been collected into two [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]]:\n\n*''[[Essential Marvel]]'':\n** ''Marvel Saga'' Vol. 1 (collects ''Marvel Saga'' #1-12, 448 pages, January 2008, ISBN 978-0-7851-2727-7)\n** ''Marvel Saga'' vol. 2 (collects ''Marvel Saga'' #13-25, 480 pages, December 2008, ISBN 978-0-7851-2728-4)\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http:\/\/www.marvel.com\/catalog\/?id=8077 Marvel.com - Essential Marvel: Marvel Saga Vol. 1]\n\n[[Category:1985 comics debuts]]\n[[Category:Historical comics]]","timestamp":"20160410101530","user-timestamp":"20150410101530"},{"title":"User talk:Deathcharge6996","content":"== February 2012 ==\n[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia.

However, I am going to make one small change to it: inserting the Jewish holidays that MJs commonly celebrate, in abbreviated form. And I will change Apostlic to \"Brit Chadasha\", which MJs use more often anyway (it means Renewed Covenant, specifically the one promised by the Prophets of the Tanakh). When creating an article that lists important figures in Messianic Judaism, make sure you list the following:\nRabbi Hillel: Hillelian ethics have a tremendous impact and similarity with the values and ethics of MJ\nTimeline of Rabbis: The Jewish Rabbis throughout history that believed Yeshua to be Jewish Mossiach, starting from Shaul and ending perhaps at Michael Rood. :D\nShalom. [[User:12.65.216.68|12.65.216.68]] 15:00, 29 October 2006 (UTC)\n\nI prefer Apostolic Scriptures, or Apostolic Writings, because it is a neutral term that all Messianics fall back on. Some use Brit Chadasha, others Apostolic Writings, and still others, New Testament; however all can agree on at least recognizing the term \"Apostolic\" to refer to these scriptures - and that is why I choose that neutral term. My goal is to eventually replace all the pages that these links point to with Messianic Judaism specific pages, where for example, we can go into detail about the issues regarding calling the Apostolic writings the Brit Chadasha, or New Testament, or whatever. I will revert back to Apostolic for now unless you disagree. Let me know what you think! [[User:Inigmatus|inigmatus]]\n\n::Well, understand that Messianic Jews don't generally like using the word \"apostle\" very much, because it's greco-hellenic and a distant translation. Yeshua HaMessiah almost certainly referred to his followers as Talmidim, or \"students\/disciples\". Your thoughts? [[User:12.65.216.68|12.65.216.68]] 18:32, 29 October 2006 (UTC)\n\n:::I would say that it's not wrong to call the writings of the Apostles as the \"Apostolic\" writings because most of their writings today come to us from a Greek text. Greek words in Messianic parlance isn't all that dissimilar either. For example, \"synagogue\" is a Greek term as well, but applying it to a Messianic congregation does not mean that the congregation is Greek. [[User:Inigmatus|inigmatus]] 04:47, 30 October 2006 (UTC)\n\n\n::I would rather that if we want to provide a link to [[Pharisees]], we should add the link to the Judaism section of the template. The reason I posted the [[Sanhedrin]] and [[Jerusalem Council]] links side by side was because they are categorically together as halakhic organizations that have been (and are now, or will be) sources for halakhic guidance for Messianic believers. If we want to include Pharisees in the Judaism section, it would then only be fair to include Sadducees, and Essenes. [[User:Inigmatus|inigmatus]] 02:17, 31 October 2006 (UTC)\n\n:::Indeed, I think including Saducess and Essenes as well would be quite fair. All of Yeshua's talmidim were Pharisees, Saducees, or Essenes. [[User:12.65.54.115|12.65.54.115]] 23:05, 31 October 2006 (UTC)\n::::Actually none of them were.

I would hope that is not the case here. Most of the items in the template appear to be about Judaism, pure and simple, not particularly about messianic Judaism. This is as if we added items about each book of the Bible to a template about Methodism. - [[User:Jmabel|Jmabel]] | [[User talk:Jmabel|Talk]] 19:54, 27 November 2006 (UTC)\n\n:The template provides quick reference to frequently asked for information that people inquiring about Messianic Judaism, have. The goal is to eventually either replace the links with links to new articles from a Messianic Judaism perspective or use, or links to subsections within the current articles listed. It's a relatively new template (only a month old), and still is a work in progress. Please see Wikiproject Messianic Judaism for further details. [[User:Inigmatus|inigmatus]] 01:23, 28 November 2006 (UTC)\n\n::The Jewish parts should be deleted. I do not see what Messianism has to do with Judaism or any Jewish objects.\n::For starters, I have removed [[Sanhedrin]]. Each and every Sanhedrin that ever existed has not quite support Xtianity. Perhaps the Sanhedrin really did call for Yoshke y\"sh to be killed. I do not see why any mentioning of the Sanhedrin is relevant to Messianism.\n::Further, I would like to see statistics on how many Messianists wear tefilin. Tefilin, on average, cost at least $400. Given the sporadic observance by most 'Messianists' (such as 1 service a week), I highly doubt whether a significant number of them owns tefilin.\n::Next, I highly doubt the number of Messianists wearing tzitzit.\n::The mentioning of the gartel is totally ridiculous. I have not in my life heard of Messianists wearing a gartel - and I do not wish to know. Thus, the gartel goes out.\n::So we have removed Sanhedrin and Gartel. Remains Tefilin and Tzitzit to discuss.\n::Next, the entire section \"Judaism - Denominations\" is totally ridiculous. Messianists are ''banned'' from making aliyah. Thus, I do not see why that is so significant to include here. The same applies to most other things mentioned there.\n::Next, Talmud. What significance does the Talmud have for Messianists? According to the Talmud, Yoshke should have been killed without trial. The Talmud, as well as many other Jewish books, are quite clear about Xtianity: it is plain idolatry. Including 'Talmud' in this template is like including 'Koran' in [[Template:Christianity]]. There is no relation at all.\n::Next, 'Services'. Linking to '[[Jewish services]]'. A shame and a lie. If you want to include that, write an article on [[Messianic services]]. The link to 'Jewish services' goes out. --[[User:Daniel575|Daniel575]] | <small>''[[User talk:Daniel575|(talk)]]''<\/small> 20:34, 29 November 2006 (UTC)\n\nFrankly, saying \"I don't see how Judaism has anything to do with Messianism\" is your POV. Messianic Judaism does see a relation to Judaism, or else it wouldn't be called Messianic ''Judaism''. The template exists to provide links to the most relevant and important topics that are important to Messianic Judaism. Most Messianics I know (about 200 plus in my local area alone) use kosher tefillin in morning prayers. I'm still paying for my set which cost $360 from a wholesaler in Israel. If you doubt Messianics wear tzitzit, perhaps you haven't seen pictures of Messianic congregations. Do a Google search, and your curiosity should be satisfied. Messianic tzitzit, talit gadol, and tallits are sold as well on several online Messianic pages. I won't talk about the gartel because you wont, lol. J\/k. Needless to say, I know of those who do wear one. I haven't yet, as I haven't been convinced yet that it's necessary. [[Aliyah]] is important to all Jews, not just non-Messianic ones. If you were Jewish you'd understand the imporance of getting back to the [[Israel|Land]] to fulfill prophecy. Current issues regarding aliyah for Messianics is a hot one and therefore that is why it is mentioned on the template. Links to Judaism and its denominations are important because all Messianics need to know what the traditionally accepted sects of Judaism there are. Finally, the Talmud is very significant to the orthodox branch of Messianic Judaism. It is important because of its historical value in documenting the \"traditions of the elders\" and other practices the early Messianic believers in the 1st century engaged in. Messianics do not hold the Talmud to be authoritative, but we do hold it to be encyclopedic in researching popular rabbinic midrash to various legal topics. Most Messianic leaders and devout Messianic Torah students have access to a copy of the Talmud and often develop the points in their parashot from them. I am reverting all the edits you have made to this template, as your edits are POV. The template is for \"a series of articles related to Messianic Judaism\" - and I can attest that they are related to Messianic Judaism.

Ideally, all those articles which bear a relevance to Messianic Judaism ''in a particular way'' ought to contain explanations, in their respective articles, of how, and these explanations should be clearly sourced. Articles on Judaism, etc., are appropriate, I think, in the template as \"background\" for Messianic Judaism, and obviously practices observed and texts studied as part of the religion are appropriate ''so long as'' they are sourced and important enough to be of note.\n::: In my opinion, the purpose of a template like this is to provide a reader unfamiliar with the topic with an overview of the articles which will give the reader an accessible but thorough understanding.

This is relevant for considering from NPOV perspective what the template should have and how it should present those things. [[User:JoshuaZ|JoshuaZ]] 04:49, 1 December 2006 (UTC)\n\n(unindent) I agree completely, Joshua. I said myself that I won't pass judgment on whether Messianic Jews are Jewish or not ''because I don't know'', but I maintain that IZAK's logic above was flawed. Now, if ''all'' major sects of Judaism disavow Messianic Judaism -- which I am willing to believe, but needs to be accurately sourced before going in an article -- then it is totally appropriate to say that: \"The major sects of Judaism (listed) all disavow Messianic Judaism as not adhering to the tenets of Judaism for the reasons XYZ.\" However, because a major world religion is ''so hard'' to define, it is still difficult to say \"Messianic Judaism is \/ is not Judaism\". What would be more appropriate would be to say \"While Messianic Jews claim to belong to the Jewish faith, the major sects of Judaism, as well as the state of Israel, disavow Messianic Judaism.\"\nHowever, the fact remains that, since Messianic Jews a) claim to be Jewish and b) claim to uphold the various Jewish laws as dictated by Jewish Scripture, then a basic understanding of Judaism and of Jewish Scripture \/ Law is necessary to a basic understanding of Messianic Judaism. Saying \"Messianic Jews claim to adhere to XYZ\" is not POV if they actually do make that claim; passing judgment as to whether or not they do -- religious law is ''very'' difficult to interpret -- ''is'' POV.\nIn my opinion, the Messianic Judaism template should include information about ''both'' Judaism ''and'' Christianity, as it bears a visible relationship to ''both'', and the information relevant to Messianic Judaism from both Judaism and Christianity should be linked. As I've said before, I'm not very well versed in Messianic Judaism so I'm not qualified to make that call, but I think the basic principle should be self-evident.\nPlease bear in mind that I am not Jewish and have a limited knowledge of Judaism, so if I've misstated or misnamed something, please correct me.\nPeace - [[User:CheNuevara|<font color=\"f0b400\">Che<\/font> <font color=\"004411\">Nuevara<\/font>]] 05:33, 1 December 2006 (UTC)\n\n: The above seems completely reasonable to me. I don't think most editors here (with the (for lack of a better term) more traditionally Jewish-POV (including Izak for that matter although he may need to speak for himself) would disagree with the above. Part of the concern stemmed from the template having what amounted to a large amount of Jewish entries and no Christian entries which created a POV issue especially given the controversial nature of the claim that messianic Judaism is Judaism (this was I suspect especially irritating because many Jews have a perception that messianic Judaism deliberately obfuscates its christian elements). If it has both relevant Christian and Jewish articles I doubt the more traditionally Jewish editors would object.

See [[Messianic Jewish theology]] for details about the acceptance of the Apostolic Writings as relevant scriptural writings. That is why it is included. It points to [[New Testament]] because Messianic Judaism does not refer to the Apostolic Writings as the [[New Testament]]. This is because we believe the \"New Covenant\" (Torah written on hearts), actually begins with Abraham at the very least, and not with Yeshua and his talidim. IZAK, we Messianics do not keep all the \"mitzvot\" of Judaism. We keep all the \"mitzvot\" of the written Torah (that is, we do all that can be done in the exile and without a Temple). Whether Messianics engage in the oral traditions found in the Talmud is an ongoing debate within the Messianic Movement. Personally the communities I am apart of in Colorado, are orthodox - at least orthodox as far as the Talmud instructs while also taking into primary consideration the ways how Yeshua and his talmidim lived out Torah. In fact, the communities I'm apart of have been singled out by Chabads, Orthodox, and other groups, as being more Torah observant than other branches of Judaism. I don't think it's a game we're playing, especially since many of us have lost jobs after our conversion, lost family relationships over the observance of Torah, and have paid other such prices such as threats by the neo nazis in the area - and real prices that have been paid by many members of our community; just to keep Torah because we believe it is what the Messiah would want us to do. I myself have paid a price for being Torah observant; but the blessings that have come from being Torah observant have been worth far more than anything I could ever lose. Ask anyone of us, and you will find out that we do Torah out of love for HaShem, as it is commanded in Torah to have the Torah written on our hearts. If the general Christian community wants to persecute us and ignore us like some kind of bad weed, and the local antimissionaries want to keep throwing stones, stealing our Torah scrolls (thankfully that's stopped recently), and if anonymous mailers and callers want to keep up the death threats; and yet we continue to survive it all, then what HaShem is doing in the hearts of those who love Yeshua as the Messiah, is true. You don't know how hard it is to live in a society that thinks you are somehow a walking contradiction. You don't know how rewarding it is to prove them wrong. To teach others that they've been misled for almost 2000 years, to teach Christians that God never abandoned us to a world without Torah, to teach Jews that God never abandoned them to a world without Messiah. If what we do is somehow not noticed by any living soul on the face of the earth, then we still have the one consolation that we know that HaShem sees what we're doing, and to Him, that is what is most important to us.  Again, if you want to talk about this with me, and you don't fear a good discussion over the issues; email me. If you think you've talked to other people like me before, then go on right ahead and continue to misunderstand, poison the well, and refuse to give those of us who truly love HaShem, His Messiah, and His Ways, the benefit of the doubt. Either on this side of Olam or on the other, you will eventually know what is truly in our hearts and just how many (very few of us indeed) of us exist in the world. It is HaShem who determines who is righteous based on our response to Him and His Messiah. Not our position, not our background, not our nation, not our works. Everything is to HaShem's glory. Shalom. [[User:Inigmatus|inigmatus]] 05:42, 31 December 2006 (UTC)\n\nHoly shit. I just wanted an answer, not your fucking life story. So again, I ask. '''Mainstream everybodies do not consider the New Testament to be Jewish Scripture. Why do you include it under that category?''' --<font color=\"red\">[[User:Kirbytime|\u0136\u0129\u0159\u03b2\u0233]]<\/font><font color=\"green\">[[Islam|\u2665]]<\/font><font color=\"pink\">[[User_talk:Kirbytime|\u0164\u012f\u0271\u00e9]]<\/font><font color=\"blue\">[[Special:Contributions\/Kirbytime|\u00d8]]<\/font> 11:42, 31 December 2006 (UTC)\n\nLet's apply some basic logic here. \"Mainstream\" Jewish bodies don't consider Messianic Judaism to even be Jewish in the first place, so why would the Apostolic Writings be considered Jewish scripture by mainstream Jewish bodies? Answer: this template doesn't deal strictly with mainstream Jewish stuff, or else it'd be a template for Judaism instead of a template for Messianic Judaism. In light of this, I don't see the relevancy of your question, because the texts listed aren't all considered \"mainstream Jewish\" scripture. If it were, then all Judaism would be Messianic. Hope that answers your question. And lastly, my \"f'in life story\" was not addressed to you, it was addressed to IZAK. Show some respect please. [[User:Inigmatus|inigmatus]] 17:34, 31 December 2006 (UTC)\n\nDo you honestly think Jews are the only ones that can hold opinions about the categorization of the New Testament? I said '''everybodies'''. The ONLY group that considers the New Testament to be Jewish Scripture is Messianic Judaism. Everybody else disagrees. Please, go to [[Portal:Christianity]], or wikiproject Christianity and ask them if the New Testament is Jewish Scripture. Go to Wikiproject atheism and ask them if the New Testament is Jewish scripture. Ask Muslims, Hindus, etc. anyone. --<font color=\"red\">[[User:Kirbytime|\u0136\u0129\u0159\u03b2\u0233]]<\/font><font color=\"green\">[[Islam|\u2665]]<\/font><font color=\"pink\">[[User_talk:Kirbytime|\u0164\u012f\u0271\u00e9]]<\/font><font color=\"blue\">[[Special:Contributions\/Kirbytime|\u00d8]]<\/font> 02:00, 1 January 2007 (UTC)\n\nIf Messianic Judaism is Judaism, then you are correct, only Messianic Jews claim the Apostolic Writings to be Jewish scriptures. But if Messianic Judaism is a separate religion from Judaism, then you are wrong, Messianic Jews don't claim the Apostolic Writings to be Jewish scriptures - they would consider them to be Messianic Jewish scriptures. Perhaps you can answer the question yourself: is Messianic Judaism, Judaism? If so, then this template has no reason to exist. [[User:Inigmatus|inigmatus]] 05:21, 1 January 2007 (UTC)\n\nWhether or not Messianic Judaism is Judaism is '''irrelevant'''. The template lists \"apostolic\" under [[:Category:Jewish texts]]. If you want to say that the New Testament is a Messianic Jewish text, then go right the fuck ahead. Put it in [[:Category:Messianic Jewish texts]], not Jewish texts. --<font color=\"red\">[[User:Kirbytime|\u0136\u0129\u0159\u03b2\u0233]]<\/font><font color=\"green\">[[Islam|\u2665]]<\/font><font color=\"pink\">[[User_talk:Kirbytime|\u0164\u012f\u0271\u00e9]]<\/font><font color=\"blue\">[[Special:Contributions\/Kirbytime|\u00d8]]<\/font> 10:27, 1 January 2007 (UTC)\n\nLanguage aside, you have a good point. I didn't realize that the heading pointed soley to the Jewish text category. If you know how one could link the header to both Jewish and Christian texts categories, we would have a compromise. In the meantime, I will happily remove the link to the Jewish texts only link. Thanks for being specific. For a while I was a bit confused as to what you were referring to. [[User:Inigmatus|inigmatus]] 14:48, 1 January 2007 (UTC)\n\n:This is to confuse the issue.  Jewish texts do not become Christian texts simply because MJ claim to believe both, and vice-versa.  You can't obfuscate the difference between the two.  Why is \"Christianity\" an unmentionable word for this template? Why don't Christian texts get their own heading?  Why is the fact that MJ ascribe to the [[New testament]] \"hidden\" by not using the plain and widely understood term (i.e. \"New Testament\" rather than \"Apostolic\")?.  \u2014[[User:Batamtig|Batamtig]] 03:38, 2 January 2007 (UTC)\n\n::Because in [[Messianic Judaism]] and other related articles written by Messianic Jewish editors, such terms as \"Apostolic Writings\" or \"Apostolic Scriptures\" are frequently used, and thus the template is provided for reference. In the future, [[New Testament]] is a prime candidate for a Messianic Judaism subcategory section which \"Apostolic\" will link directly to in order to be more specific as to the \"Apostolic\" name. Other terms have been disputed between Messianics. Some want to use \"Brit Chadesha.\" It's a good debate. But for now, Apostolic is a sourced reference just as good as Brit Chadesha, which is more sourced as the Messianic name for the New Testament, than the \"New Testament\" is. The name \"New Testament\" in Messianic Judaism implies a theology that the \"New Covenant\" is after the \"Old Covenant\" commonly referred to by Christians as the Old Testament - a sum theology that all Messianics outright reject since we believe the \"New Covenant\" began at least with Abraham; and that \"New Testament\" is an inappropriate term to describe the Apostolic Writings. I can provide multiple sources for this if you'd like. [[User:Inigmatus|inigmatus]] 06:37, 2 January 2007 (UTC)\n\n:::This is MJ POV.  Articles, no matter who they're written by, even if they're about MJ, should be NPOV, not MJ POV.  Most observers would say that the substance of what MJ believe in and call \"Brit Chadesha\" (sic) is not significantly different to what is commonly known as \"New Testament\".  The same thing goes for \"Yeshua\" (sic) and \"Jesus\".  Regardless of MJ rationalizations about this, many regard the MJ practice of referring to essentially Christian elements of belief by ''invented'', sanitized, \"hebraized\", and \"judaized\" terms, as simply a tactic to \"lure\" Jews into a version of Christianity.  They do this by making the Christian elements \u2014 which are regarded by the vast majority of Jews as non-Jewish \u2014 ''sound'' more Jewish, while not changing the essence of the beliefs at all (and this essence of belief is the reason that Jews rejected the beliefs in the first place).  I don't see why WP should support this blatantly MJ agenda by supporting these invented terms.  To do this is to obfuscate the fact that MJ ''do'' believe in the divinity of Jesus (as do Christians) and in the veracity of the New Testament (as do Christians).\n\n:::So what do we do with terms like \"Brit Chadesha\" (sic), which after all refers to a phrase often used by MJ, but which would mislead those with no prior knowledge into thinking that it's something different than the New Testament?  The NPOV thing to do would be to make clear what it means (to most non-MJ, again) by linking to both articles on the template, thus \"[[Brit Chadasha]] ([[New Testament]])\" or alternatively \"[[Apostolic]] ([[New Testament]])\".  However, they can't be placed in the same category as Jewish texts, since this would reflect the MJ POV that the \"Apostolic\" (sic) writings are Jewish texts.  They are widely accepted to be Christian texts and should be listed as such.  WP should reflect verifiable knowledge, not MJ classifications.\n\n:::Also, your Hebrew is deficient, it's \"Chadasha\" not \"Chadesha\". \u2014[[User:Batamtig|Batamtig]] 07:37, 2 January 2007 (UTC)\n\n::::Thanks for pointing that out. Last I checked, Hebrew uses a different alephbet. :) [[User:Inigmatus|inigmatus]] 08:24, 2 January 2007 (UTC)\n:::::Nice try, Inigmatus, but in matters of transliteration, the only subject relevant here, Hebrew's \"different alephbet\" [sic] is irrelevant, inasmuch as such an argument seeks to delegitimize all objections regarding inaccuracies, presumably in the representation of vowel sounds.  It is \"chadasha\" unequivically and nearly universally...and in all cases where that transliteration is ''not'' universal, none support \"chadesha\" as an acceptable alternative.

Second, I applaud your effort at a compromise, however I think a fundamental difference is in over the purpose of the template: namely that Third, this is not a template to link all Messianic-exclusive articles only. It's a template to link articles related to Messianic Judaism as a topic. Exclusivity to a topic is not a required template parameter in [[WP:TFD]]. Templates can have links to articles related to the subject which the template appears on, but the articles linked in the template may not always have to be themselves totally exclusive to the template's topic to be useful and informative. I will re-add the deleted content because the deleted content are a list of articles relevant to Messianic Judaism if one were to visit any orthodox Messianic synagogue. Again, if people want sources, I'll be happy to provide them. [[User:Inigmatus|inigmatus]] 08:56, 11 January 2007 (UTC)\n\n===Article List===\nList of Related Articles (which are also non-exclusive to Messianic Judaism) and their reasons for inclusion:\n#[[Names of God in Judaism|God]] Messianics use these very names of HaShem in their liturgy, speech, and other forms of communication. People visiting a Messianic synagogue would be exposed to these names, thus the reason for their inclusion in the template.\n#[[Jewish Messiah|Messiah]] Of all things, I don't suppose the term ''Messianic'' has any relationship to ''Messiah''? Linking to an article that does not necessarily support [[Yeshua]] as the Messiah, is still relevant to Messianic Judaism, if only to present the standard view in Judaism as to the nature of the Messiah.\n#[[Covenant (biblical)|Covenants]] Without the Covenant, Messianic Judaism doesn't stand on anything. A fundamental understanding of the Covenant is essential to understanding the position that Messianic Judaism takes in the identity of its adherents!\n#[[Jewish holiday|Holidays]] All Torah-observant Messianics, and even so-called non-Torah observant Messianics celebrate most if not all the holidays listed on that article. I know I do. And most of us don't celebrate any others. The celebration of holidays (and the refusal to celebrate non Jewish holidays) is a dividing point between Messianic family members and those that come from non-Jewish backgrounds. Arguments against celebrating the Jewish holidays are often the first argument that new Messianics will find themselves having to defend against, and thus they are listed in the template for easy reference for any non Messianic who wants to know what holidays that Messianics observe.\n#[[Shabbat]] It's a sad day indeed when a Messianic has to stand up for the core of his weekly activity. This article is not only relevant to Messianic Judaism, but is a necessity in describing the traditional observances of Shabbat that are found in the majority of Messianic homes. A separate article about Shabbat for Messianic Jews is not needed since we do most if not everything found in [[Shabbat]]! Do I really have to post a source on the importance of including this article as being RELEVANT to Messianic Judaism? Its the second argument that new Messianics often have to stand up for  when confronting non Messianic Christians.\n#[[Kosher]] Although keeping kosher tends to be a divisive issue in some groups that call themselves \"Messianic\" - all Torah-observant Messianics I've ever known are kosher, and Torah-observant Messianic Judaism has its source based right from the Torah!\n#[[Tzitzit]] Why are such relevant articles to Torah-observance being removed from the Messianic Judaism template? Since when did Torah-observance no longer apply to Torah-observant Messianic Jews? Come on now, even my first recognized mitzvah as a Messianic was to make my first set of tzitzit as we are commanded in Torah. Irregardless if the commandment applies, the fact is, Torah-observant Messianics do it, and thus this is a very outwardly relevant article to Messianic Judaism - where Messianics are even willing to wear them when some other denominations in Judaism care not to!\n#[[Mikvah]] This is another Torah commandment that Torah-observant Messianics engage in. It's well-known. It's even more well known when Messianics are denied access to Jewish community Mikvah tanks, that they have to resort to making their own! Thus this is a very relevant topic to Messianic Judaism as it only serves to highlight another bone of contention that Messianics have when faced with persecution from Jewish communities. Perhaps a future subsection in [[Mikvah]] will be developed to showcase some examples of such prejudice.\n#[[Circumcision in the Bible]] Yet another Torah commandment that gets removed from the template, probably based on some false belief that Messianics don't engage in brit milah - circumcision. Do I need to scan a copy of an invitation our congregation's most recent ceremony for a new family? Do I need to post last Shabbat's message about our rabbi telling that he believes all Messianics need to get circumcised - or even documenation of his and other men his age that recently went through with it?\n#[[Conversion to Judaism|Conversion]] I would personally have this article listing deleted if it weren't for the serious fact that this issue has been the largest division in the Messianic Movement since 1997 when it was proposed by the UMJC as a standard for greater recognition within mainstream Judaism. Perhaps a subsection will be further developed explaining this historical rift and its relevancy to a large half of Messianic believers (of which I am not one).\n#[[Jewish eschatology|Eschatology]] If anything since Jewish eschatology doesn't explain who the Messiah is, perhaps rather than deleting this article link outright, just have it point to the current subsection on Eschatology in the Messianic theology article, as long as that subsection in Messianic theology also points to a \"See also\" to [[Jewish eschatology]] since Messianic eschatology simply builds off from [[Jewish eschatology]] and explains it further from its Messianic viewpoint. Personally I see a future development of a Messianic Judaism subsection on [[Jewish eschatology]] once the subsection regarding it in Messianic theology gets too big. Then the third step would be to have its own article with both former host articles pointing references to it.\n#[[Ten Lost Tribes|Lost Tribes]] The Two House movement within Messianic Judaism ascribes to fundamental belief that they are all part of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel. I of course disagree with their assertion in part; but the importance of bringing in the Ten Lost Tribes back to Israel from the exile is of utmost importance to other Messianics in order to fulfill [[Jewish eschatology]].\n#[[Sanhedrin]] The Sanhedrin is a very relevant article to include in the template if not for the fact that Torah observant Messianics have been looking for the reconstituted one to begin making halakhic decisions to resolve disputes over halakha in Messianic circles. Also the history of the Sanhedrin is important in its relation to the development of halakha during the time of [[Yeshua]] which would find itself in the [[Talmud]].\n#[[Tabernacle (Judaism)|Tabernacle]] Another Torah commandment if the Temple is not restored. Torah-observant Messianics would engage in Tabernacle services if there was one set up where HaShem's name is.\n#[[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] Even better than the Tabernacle, a restored Temple on Mount Moriah would be the center of Messianic Jewish worship, just like the early believers of [[Yeshua]].\n#[[Korban|Sacrifices]] Part of the Temple\/Tabernacle system, and would be a normal part of Messianic Jewish worship; something that would certainly distinguish them from their often-confused Christian counterparts. Such a system of the reinstitution of sacrifices could only lead to the greatest schism in Christianity as Messianic Judaism would most likely be the only believers in Yeshua to set the standard for all believers in Messiah to engage in.\n#[[Messianic religious practice|Religious practice]] Why rename it to Messianic Practice? It already is in the Messianic section of the template. Thus Religious practice fits just as well.\n#[[Halakha|Jewish Halakha]] Since [[Messianic Halakha]] seems to be separated from [[Halakha|Jewish Halakha]], then so too is a link to Jewish Halakha included here to show to the editor that there isn't much different between these two redundant articles. Again, this wasn't my idea, but if non Messianic editors want to see separate Messianic articles for redundant Jewish info, be my guest. We're outnumbered here anyways and we don't have the time to recreate articles already in existence since the invention of dirt.\n#[[Jewish services|Services]] Just like Shabbat, traditional services are found everywhere in all orthodox Torah observant Messianic synagogues. A newcommer to Messianic Judaism would find this link not only useful, but necessary in knowing what to expect when visiting one.\n#[[List of Jewish prayers and blessings|Prayers and Blessings]] I've lost count how many Siddurs I've given out to new Messianic believers. The vast majority of those listed in this article are used by Messianics, so many in fact that the create a separate article just to promote the very minor differences (if any, depending on what flavor of Messianic Judaism one happens to be familiar with) would be overly redundant in scope.\n#[[613 mitzvot|Mitzvot]] Rambam worked hard on composing this list. Messianics probably work harder to do them (those that can be done in the circumstances), and probably suffer more persecution as a result of doing them. This list is essential knowledge for the Torah observant Messianic.\n#[[Minhag|Customs]] Another halakhic issue in Messianic Judaism is over the adoption of various customs and traditions. Again, informative information related to Torah observant Messianic Judaism (and Torah observant Messianics seem to be from my experience, the vast majority).\n#[[Midrash]] How can any good Erev Shabbat conclude without an all-night long Midrash from the Torah or the Prophets? Furthermore, such discussions can sometimes cover all aspects of PaRDeS, of which Midrash is only one.\n#[[Talmud]] Granted not many Messianics have a Talmud sitting on their home library shelf. I happen to be one that only has it on CD, but the orthodox synagogue I attend has one for the congregation to read from and to teach from. I don't think I've heard a Shabbat message yet that doesn't reference the Talmud at least once. How dare the words of the Sages be removed from a template of articles related to Messianic Judaism.\n#[[Tallit]] A Messianic without his tallit in an orthodox Messianic shacharit is like a woman without her headcovering: exposed.\n#[[Tefillin]] Oh, did I mention shacharit above? Hmm, somewhere I once heard the Tefillin had something to do with shacharit... could be something to do with prayer maybe (end sarcasm here). Ah yes, I remember now... I spent $360 on my set which I use every day with my Siddur! Oy veh, how can I drill this fact into Wiki? Maybe I should start posting links to papers, articles, posts, etc teaching Messianics about set time prayers, about Tefillin wearing, about Shacharit, about the controversy over praying the curse on heretics... this article is definitely relevant to Messianic Judaism - at least the Torah observance majority of it. Tefillin is no easy thing to grasp (no pun intended) for those not used to it, and that is why it should be included in this template.\n#[[Yarmulke|Kipa]] The next time I visit a Reconstructionist synagogue and see the men without kippot, I think I will lend out a couple of my own. Do I have to provide a source that says Messianics typically wear knitted kippot, whereas orthodox Jews where black? I'm sure its out there.\n#[[Sefer Torah]] Oops, hmmm, Sefer Torah... gee I wonder what that is? Oh yeah, I remember now, it's the scroll in your Tefillin set, friend. The Shema ya know..., um what we pray during Shacharit?\n#[[Tzitzit]] already addressed above.\n#[[Mezuzah]] Classic joke: A Mezuzah for a Jaguar, anyone know (ortho, conserv, and recon)? Anyways, another Torah commandment to have the commandments written on the doorposts. I've got three for my lil apartment. A Messianic is one who isn't afraid to put one up on their apartment door even though skinheads roam the area.\n#[[Menorah]] I have a nice Menorah. Would you like pictures? We light it on Erev Shabbat whenever we have guests over, otherwise we stick with just the traditional two candlesticks.\n#[[Shofar]] For a Messianic, shofar blowing is synonymous with starting Erev Shabbat, Feast of Trumpets, and the sign of a true man. Most Messianic CDs will have a picture of a shofar somewhere on it, I'm sure.\n#[[Four Species|4 Species]] Time to wave your lulav on Tabernacles. Yet another Torah commandment. Most Christians when visiting the synagogue don't even have a clue; just like some editors who want to remove this article listing from Template Messianic Judaism.\n#[[Kittel]] Nice white robe thingy. One wears it on High Holy Days and other special occasions... which I think (holidays) was another link removed from the template without consideration of the facts. [http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/28259271@N00\/sets\/72157594311306744\/ Pictures of Messianic Kittels]\n#[[Gartel]] Ok, so IZAK has a problem with this one. Ok so IZAK doesn't know that Messianics think any belt will suffice to fulfill this mitzvah.\n#[[Yad]] I almost bought one for a friend who owns a Torah scroll. (Dont worry, I'm not giving any names. Last I heard, the antimissionaries in our area had a mission to break in and steal any Torah scrolls owned by Messianics).\n#[[Judaism]] Yes, that beloved sister religion. Has something to do with Messianic Judaism, I'm sure, but to be honest, I just don't know. I mean, you'd think that they'd welcome us with open arms as family, and instead we're treated as diseased outsiders. If only they knew that Godly love triumphs over any human misunderstanding...and oh brother, how misunderstood we really are - by both Jews and Christians!\n#[[Jewish denominations#Divisions|Denominations]]Judaism's divisions are important background knowledge to the Jewish information on Wikipedia. Judaism is listed in the template as as section, just as Christianity is also listed as a section on the template. Both religions and their exclusive articles are listed for relevant reference. However, removing the Jewish section and leaving the Christian section just proves the editor doesn't know the difference between Messianic Judaism and Christianity. If a Christian section is going to be listed, then a Judaism section must also be listed for we consider ourselves equally related to both - no matter how teeth grating that is for some people for us to say.\n#[[Timeline of Jewish history|Timeline]] Part of the Jewish section.\n#[[History of ancient Israel and Judah|Early history]] Part of the Jewish section.\n#[[Schisms among the Jews|Schisms]] Part of the Jewish section, focus though is on Schisms to show that Jews have had their schism just as much as Christians (and vice versa). Both Jewish and Christian sections of the template list relatively equal things related to their sections.\n#[[Pharisees]] - a sect that some Torah observant Messianics (like myself) believe Yeshua belonged to.\n#[[Sadducees]] - a sect that the Pharisees were at odds against, and seem to have some theological fatherhood to the modern Karaite movement that also seeks to divide Messianic Judaism.\n#[[Essenes]] - The Dead Sea scrolls and their authors takes one on a tangent to information about texts that were copied which had no Christian axe to grind; and which texts support the Messianic position regarding the Torah observance of Saul\/Paul by using the same phrases found in Paul's letters, to exonerate Torah observance, and to instead promote it as something that all Messianic believers should be doing.\n#[[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora]] Messianics are truly still in the Diaspora, not able to make Aliyah.  A history of the diaspora and information about it currently is relevant to all Messianics, both in and outside the Land. I for one am descended from Sephardic Jews. Two House theology Messianics also would consider this article relevant to 90% of their theology.\n#[[Aliyah]] Means to go up... to return to the Land specifically in this case - for Messianics are unable to return to Israel as Messianics. I can cite several court cases to this fact. Many Messianics would see that they have a prophetic obligation to return to the Land, but until current circumstances and rulings change, it's a hot-button issue that has triggered other divisive issues within Messianic Judaism (such as conversion to Judaism).\n\nI look forward to anyone disputing these. For now, and until then, I am reverting the changes made to the template unless someone discusses and disputes these items individually; or the focus of the template entirely. [[User:Inigmatus|inigmatus]] 08:56, 11 January 2007 (UTC)\n\n:Inigmatus, there are a number of problems, not only with what you've done, but with your reasons for doing so.  You clearly do ''not'' understand [[WP:OWN]].  Your confrontational tone and actions further demonstrate a fundamental failure to grasp the concepts of [[WP:CON]] and [[WP:AGF]].  That aside, perhaps you should start a discussion for once, instead of simply reacting [negatively, at that] to whatever anyone else does or says.  How about you start with an explanation of what you think the focus of this template should be, and we can go from there.  Meanwhile, on a somewhat related issue, is it possible to turn that monstrosity of an image on the top into something a bit less distracting?  Images in templates should be decorative, instructive or helpful in some other way (navigation, for example).  The image is perhaps representative of the philosophy adhered to by most practitioners of \"Messianic Judaism\", but it is huge, distracting, uninformative to the casual reader (and equally unnecessary to the well-informed reader), unattractive, and generally, unsuitable.

You can find the discussion about the purpose for this template [[Template talk:Messianic Judaism#What is the purpose of this template?|here]] and the discussion about the symbol used in the template [[Template talk:Messianic Judaism#Symbol|here]]. Before accusing me of failing to grasp [[WP:OWN]], [[WP:CON]], or [[WP:AGF]], you will find that your questions have already been answered on this talk page. I would ask that you [[WP:AGF]] my edits as well, and realize that they are done in a serious effort to promote [[WP:CON]] in a very contentious area of WP, as I do not [[WP:OWN]] this template. I may religiously patrol this template (no pun intended), but I do like to see major changes to the template be discussed first with consensus as arbitrary changes in Messianic Judaism pages tend to spark unproductive edit wars. I would further ask that you consider [[WP:CIV]], [[WP:EQ]], in addition to [[WP:AGF]] when making posts in this talk page. Thanks!

Anyhow, here it is, courtesy of Wikipedia, and you can draw your own conclusions:\n\n:\"The most famous quote to come out of the battle was from the 101st\u2019s acting commander, [[Anthony McAuliffe|Brigadier General Anthony McAuliffe]], when awakened by an enemy request for his [[surrender]]: \u201cNuts!\u201d (the general's [[interpreting|interpreter]] [[translate]]d McAuliffe\u2019s reply as \u201cGo to hell!\u201d). The Germans were unable to take the town.\"\n\nHow apt! [[User:IZAK|IZAK]] 08:54, 17 January 2007 (UTC)\n\nIZAK, you still don't seem to know the difference between Messianic Judaism and Christianity. Do Christians reject paganism and mixtures in their worship? No. Do Christians keep kosher? No. Do Christians observe all the written Torah that God gave to Israel - even when they believe they are Israel somehow by replacing her? NO. They don't wear tzitzit, don't grow out their beards, don't worship God on his moedim, don't observe set-time prayers according to Torah, don't keep their heads covered, don't go through mikvehs in accordance to the laws of niddah, or observe circumcision as a mitzvah. Messianics do all this. \n\nChristians eat pork on December 25, two days after the Winter Solstice, celebrating the incarnation of Jesus by a star over a tree. Christians try to take pagan forms of worship and make them HaShem's! Even oral Torah is as foreign to Christians as the eucharist is to orthodox Jews.\n\nMessianic Judaism is also different from Judaism. In fact, we not only have our polemics against Christians, but we have a bone of contention with non Messianic Jews. Does Judaism follow the Spirit of God or do they follow Kabbalah - or have they somehow mixed the two together? Do they look to numerology and the study of Gematria to determine the truth of a passage of Torah, and place their traditions higher and over and against clearly written and expressed Torah commandments? Is ORAL TORAH higher in authority in Judaism over and against WRITTEN TORAH?  Yes!!!!  Are passages dealing with such concepts as HaMemra, Abraham's visitors, the Angel of Adonai, the face that Moses saw... all explained away as something over and against Christianity? Why is it that Judaism defines itself not as a written Torah-centered faith, but as a faith defined in opposition to Christianity? I think it's good that they are taking a Torah stand against many ugly Christian ideas and practices. But Messianic Judaism doesn't throw out the baby with the bathwater. We see Messiah throughout the Torah. We have come to know and believe Messiah is the one from whom Torah comes from and gave the written tablets to Moses! We believe that he showed up on earth 2000 years ago, and believed that he was rejected, and crushed, as the Prophets foretold that he would be. Furthermore we believe in one Messiah that God has for us, one Prophet who was to come after Moses like him. His name is Yeshua, his name means \"HaShem Saves.\" And how badly those who don't know him need saved from their own vain philosophies and practices.\n\nBoth modern rabbinic Judaism and Christianity are dispensational. Rabbinics think Judah has replaced Israel. Christians think the Church has replaced Israel. According to Torah, both are wrong!\n\nHaShem wants us all to be Torah observant - all who draw near to God (gee that sounds like a familiar Hebraic concept!) - HaShem gave Torah to the world through Israel, and not just Torah only to just Israel! Rabbinic Judaism has forgotten the commission of God to do Torah and let the world see it and want to do it too! The Chabads are probably closes to this, but inventing some man-made doctrine of Noachide laws when the whole thing contradicts Torah, is falling far short of God's commission to Israel to live Torah and let the world see true Torah observance! Israel is to share Torah with the world, for Israel is a nation of nations. The nation of Israel is descended from a righteous called-out and choosen Gentile from Aram, who witnessed to Gentiles in Haran, some of whom who joined him and his household. Contrary to what you may believe, according to Torah, Gentiles were always part of God's plan for Israel. There is no such thing in the TaNaKh as a ger toshav! Even Israel is called a ger! Messianic Jews believe this, because it's written in the Torah. Israel is made up of both Gentiles who have faith in the Promised Seed, and their descendents, and according to Ezekiel, those in Israel not directly descended from Jacob will be GIVEN a permanent tribal inheritance and identity in wherever tribe they settle in when the Messiah does come to sit and rule forever on David's throne in the World to Come! If modern rabbinic, and Kabbalistic Judaism, and Christianity want to ignore this, reject it, then may their rejection be on their heads. Messianic Judaism aims to reeducate people back to the written Torah, and not into some man-invented tradition that nullifies it! You misunderstand us when you misunderstand the Torah.  Shalom. [[User:Inigmatus|inigmatus]] 18:51, 17 January 2007 (UTC)\n\n*Hi Inigmatus, as I skimmed over your words here I was tempted to rush for my violin. Then this must be the joke of the month: that I \"misunderstand us when you misunderstand the Torah\" -- hahahahahaha! As they say: Tell that to the marines! Sorry, you can cut up and cook a chicken any way you want, you can even buy a kosher chicken for that matter, but if you cook it and eat it for the greater glory of Jesus then you are a Christian and nothing but, 'cause even a Jew with a ''kippa'' and a ''gartel'' who may know the Torah backwards (or is it the ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'' that he's read and fakes that he knows \"Torah,\" hmmm) yet who spouts belief in Jesus in any shape size or form is a Christian, get used to that idea. Gotta go for now, but I'll be back soon. [[User:IZAK|IZAK]] 22:40, 17 January 2007 (UTC)\n\n*So a Christian is defined by a belief in Jesus? In that case if that is the ONLY qualification, I suppose you don't believe that Jesus ever existed and thus that makes you not a Christian. Methinks we better take this discussion to our user talk pages. [[User:Inigmatus|inigmatus]] 23:50, 17 January 2007 (UTC)\n\nBelieving that Jesus was the messiah and Savior of Mankind = Christian. Messianics believe that Jesus was the messiah and savior of Mankind. Therefore, they are Christians.

This is an encyclopedia to report on what people believe, not what ''you believe about them'' - that goes both ways. Whether you think they're Jews or not matters ''not one lick''. If they call themselves Jews, that's what matters; if they don't then ditto we report on exactly that. Many Christians believe [[Mormonism]] or the [[Watchtower Society]] are not truly Christianity but are cults; but to not let them reference Bible texts in their template is absurd and the very definition of POV-pushing. And this goes for Inigmatus too - this discussion needs to stop, right now, about being \"are Messianic Jews actually Jews\" and start being \"how can we accurately represent what ''Messianic Jews believe''\". [[User:Patstuart|Patstuart]]<sup>[[User_talk:Patstuart|talk]]|[[Special:contributions\/Patstuart|edits]]<\/sup> 18:44, 18 January 2007 (UTC)\n\nPat, you're missing the point. This is about this template including links to things that have '''nothing''' to do with Messianic Judaism. Putting things like the 613 mitzvot, and other Jewish things on this template is a violation of NPOV. It would be akin to putting Rosh Hashanah on the Christianity template. --<font color=\"red\">[[User:Kirbytime|\u0136\u0129\u0159\u03b2\u0233]]<\/font><font color=\"green\">[[Islam|\u2665]]<\/font><font color=\"pink\">[[User_talk:Kirbytime|\u0164\u012f\u0271\u00e9]]<\/font><font color=\"blue\">[[Special:Contributions\/Kirbytime|\u00d8]]<\/font> 06:30, 19 January 2007 (UTC)\n:OK, fine, ''if'' they have nothing to do with Messianic Judaism, fine. But it's not like putting Rush Hashanah on a Christianity template, because Christians don't celebrate that holiday. All I'm saying is, I don't care, really, what's included and what's not: I ''really don't''. But the argument here should not be \"are Messianic Jews actually Jewish?\" It should be - does it help out navigation? Do other similar templates for other controversial groups have such info on them? Etc. Making silly statements like \"they have crosses in their rented buildings, so they're not Jewish\" (as seen below) is just off-topic and non-sequitur to the argument.  [[User:Patstuart|Patstuart]]<sup>[[User_talk:Patstuart|talk]]|[[Special:contributions\/Patstuart|edits]]<\/sup> 06:39, 19 January 2007 (UTC)\n::Pat, can you point out where anyone MADE such a statement? I cannot seem to find it. If you are referring to the edit below, is it possible that you are reading something in to the edit based on your own preconceived notions of how that editor may percieve things, or how you perceive things? I am not 100% certain that your assumption is indicative of good faith in that case. Stop for a moment, and think long and hard about how your interpretation of the edit demonstrates your own biases and preconceptions. Now, if you actually have a direct quote saying that someone said \"b\/cthere is a cross therefore they must be Christian\", I'll be glad to retract all of this. -- [[User:Avraham|Avi]] 14:10, 19 January 2007 (UTC)\n:::I apologize if that's not what you meant, I really do. But why else in the world would you bring up that cross in this discussion? And, to spin this whole thing around, please [[WP:AAGF]] - I was no less sure of your good faith than you are of mine, and your pre-conceived notions are just as volitile as mine. Now if you can tell me why you decided to post a picture of a cross in Messianic Jewish worship, in the context of people arguing that Messianics are Christians and not Jews, with the quote \"is that a cross I see?\", and ''not'' be referring to that argument, then please do (in other words, why ''did'' you post that cross?). If you can explain it sufficiently, I will retract the statement completely. And, as for me [[WP:AGF]]ing, please understand, that sometimes people can imply something without saying it (as I'm sure you know; [[Bill Clinton|good example]]), and it's easy for others to read into words. -[[User:Patstuart|Patstuart]]<sup>[[User_talk:Patstuart|talk]]|[[Special:contributions\/Patstuart|edits]]<\/sup> 02:50, 20 January 2007 (UTC)\n:Last I checked, Rosh Hashanna was a commandment God expressly gave to the Israelites, not just to the tribe of Judah (the Jews), that is, if you want to go that route. If you want to take the reality check route, show me a single Messianic congregation that DOESN'T celebrate Rosh Hashanna with the blowing of the shofar. It's a relevant topic, and to say it has \"nothing\" to do with Messianic Judaism only shows the ignorance of the person making that statement - no personal attack here is intended.

They are renting space in a Baptist Church, and the larger congregation that showed up for Yom Kippor forced the move of the observance to the main sanctuary where that cross is.  Jewish congregations rent space from Christian churches all the time, and vice versa. [[User:Inigmatus|inigmatus]] 20:54, 18 January 2007 (UTC)\n\n=== tips to avoid edit wars ===\n\nI just got done reviewing some of the recent discussion regarding deleting this template.  While I do not think it should be deleted, many of the points make sense.  For example, don't put [[Jewish holidays]] in this template, as that is not specific to '''M'''J, and don't put this template on [[Jewish holidays]].  Rather, it would make more sense to create [[Jewish holidays in Messianic Judaism]], put that link in this template, and include the template on that page.  This new article could be linked from the \"Variances in observances\" section of [[Jewish holidays]], hopefully without too much controversy.  (Any claims of \"hijacking\" would be obviously baseless to any neutral observer, and rather indicative of pure bias on the part of the claimant.)  Such articles would tend to be short, methinks, as I imagine they'd start with <nowiki>{{<\/nowiki>main|article name ''sans'' \"in Messianic Judaism\"<nowiki>}}<\/nowiki>, and detail only the differences from the mainstream view.  Sure, this approach would mean lots of red links in this template initially, but perhaps that would motivate people to get to work.  &#9786; &hArr; [[User:ChristTrekker|ChristTrekker]] 21:11, 30 January 2007 (UTC)\n:Seems reasonable at first glance. -- [[User:Avraham|Avi]] 21:43, 30 January 2007 (UTC)\n::The idea has been suggested before, however I ask an important question which [[Jewish holidays]] are not celebrated in Messianic Judaism? I can attest I and many others in many other communities celebrate them all, or some communities celebrate some where some celebrate the others. Good idea though, just very very redundant.[[User:Inigmatus|inigmatus]] 01:56, 31 January 2007 (UTC)\n:::(First, a reminder that [[Jewish holidays]] is merely an example.)  The issue isn't necessarily that a different set of holidays are celebrated in MJ, it's whether or not the holidays are celebrated differently.  If not, then there's no reason to edit [[Jewish holidays]] or create a new article, so there's no conflict with the mainstream group.  Since there ''has'' been conflict, then one must conclude that there ''is'' some distinction in the practice of observance, which causes objection whenever those MJ-specific notes are introduced to the articles.  An article to detail those differences makes sense.  It may be redundant to introduce another article that just parallels an existing one, but if that is the only solution that avoids edit wars....  &#9785;  I agree it's not ideal\u2014I'd vastly prefer that everyone could simply be mature enough to tolerate differing viewpoints\u2014but what else do you suggest? &hArr; [[User:ChristTrekker|ChristTrekker]] 15:38, 31 January 2007 (UTC)\nHit again with [[WP:TFD]], again.  Let's brainstorm and come up with (and implement) some working ideas.  I suggest trimming the template and forking articles, as I mentioned above. &hArr; [[User:ChristTrekker|ChristTrekker]] 16:34, 5 February 2007 (UTC)\n\nSince the \"Judaism\" articles are relevant to \"Messianic Judaism\" as well, and the primary complaint on the TfD discussion is that this template is redundant\/confusing\/stolen, what about using some fancy JavaScript thing to make the section with the mainstream Jewish articles hidden but expand when desired.  Articles that highlight '''M'''J in particular can be \"above the fold\". &hArr; [[User:ChristTrekker|ChristTrekker]] 15:38, 6 February 2007 (UTC)\n\n:That actually sounds like a neat idea. Feel free to implement it. You have my support. I've taken a break from Wiki for now, as my limited time has been totally consumed by chasing down VfDs, and I feel I can not contribute anything productive as a result without the nagging feeling that I'm herding cats. Animosity towards MJ articles and templates has produced a superpolicing of the MJ contributions to wiki which I feel if someone wants to enforce the majority opinion over against true consensus efforts to improve articles, then my time here is done and over with, and better spent elsewhere. Shalom. Thanks for at least trying to help. :) Not many do. [[User:Inigmatus|inigmatus]] 05:38, 7 February 2007 (UTC)\n::From a purely technical aspect it sounds interesting.

The rural community is situated along Highways [[Highway 31 (Arkansas)|31]] and [[Highway 305 (Arkansas)|305]], in addition to the county-maintained El Paso Road. Though relatively small, the community maintains a variety of activities and institutions throughout the year, notably its annual parade and display of fireworks during [[Fourth of July|Independence Day]].\n\n== Geography and history ==\nLacking exact boundaries, Floyd is located within Coffey Township, in western White County. The largest part of the community today is located approximately 11 miles northwest of [[Beebe, Arkansas]]. Among the earliest settlers in the area was James Barnett and his family in 1842;<ref name=\"History of Floyd\">{{cite web|title=History of Floyd|url=http:\/\/eduzaurus.com\/blog\/history-of-floyd|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}<\/ref> nearby Lake Barnett shares the name of these pioneers. Another indicator of the community's longevity is the first local cemetery, which was used as early as December 1865, when Jesse Levi Akin was the first person buried in what is now the Old Floyd Cemetery.\n\nThe historic [[Southwest Trail]], a path used by most travelers entering Arkansas early in the 1800s, entered Floyd on today's Highway 305 from Center Hill, then headed to [[El Paso, Arkansas|El Paso]] via El Paso Road. By the 1830s more than 80 percent of the Arkansas territory's population had entered through the Southwest Trail. The route is also known as the Old Military Road.<ref name=\"Southwest Trail in Arkansas\">{{cite web|title=Southwest Trail|url=http:\/\/www.arkansasheritagetrails.com\/Southwest\/|website=Arkansas Heritage Trail|publisher=Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}<\/ref>\n\n== Education ==\nWhile Floyd maintained a separate school district in its earlier years, the community today is served by the [[Beebe School District]].  The former school cafeteria still stands along the east side of Highway 31, and has served as a community center for many years since consolidation of the school district.\n\nIn addition, the community hosts a chapter of the Extension Homemakers Clubs, an outreach of the [[University of Arkansas]] Division of Agriculture's [[Cooperative Extension System|Cooperative Extension Service]]. Through the local EH Club, topics of improving community and family dynamics are often addressed through workshops, regular monthly member meetings, and participation in exhibitions such as the annual White County Fair and Livestock Show. Similarly, the community also offers a [[4-H]] chapter for area youth educational enhancement.\n\n==External links==\n* [http:\/\/eduzaurus.com\/blog\/history-of-floyd Floyd historical information] from the White County Historical Society\n* [http:\/\/www.rootsweb.com\/~arwhite\/cems\/Floyd_Cemetery_files\/floyd_cemetery_floyd_arkansas.htm Floyd Cemetery information]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{White County, Arkansas}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1842]]\n[[Category:Unincorporated communities in Arkansas]]\n[[Category:Unincorporated communities in White County, Arkansas]]","timestamp":"20160410101539","user-timestamp":"20150410101539"},{"title":"User talk:74.67.167.178","content":"== January 2015 ==\n[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Thank you for your contributions.

In order to understand the comment you need to understand what a Mercy Hospital is. Whereas before Charles would only work for the most prestigious hospital in Boston the Massachusetts General Hospital where my sister was an intern he would feel most at home coming back from MASH to the hospital which is most egalitarian and does not screen for the ability to pay.\n*The issues here are twofold: grammar and original research. If you have to explain to me what the comment means, there is something wrong with the comment. Besides, I still don't understand it. But really, you are arguing here how a fictional character from a TV show, if he were real, would pick the hostpical where your sister was an intern? [[User:Drmies|Drmies]] ([[User talk:Drmies#top|talk]]) 04:58, 10 August 2009 (UTC)\nMGH exists and is and used to be even more the most prestigious in Boston while the Mercy Hospital system as of the end of the Korean War included patients who were poor and was run as more of a charity. It indicates a values change in the character. [[Special:Contributions\/72.93.82.245|72.93.82.245]] ([[User talk:72.93.82.245|talk]]) 05:15, 10 August 2009 (UTC)\n*?

[[User:Blackmetalbaz|Blackmetalbaz]] ([[User talk:Blackmetalbaz|talk]]) 14:35, 19 August 2009 (UTC)\n\n== [[Dale Bozzio]] ==\n\nOn June 23, you deleted much of Dale Bozzio's Personal Life information, but left the references. Shortly thereafter, the editor who had originally entered the information that you deleted reinserted the same information in a shortened write-up.\nAt the point that the editor reentered the information, it was public knowledge that Ms. Bozzio had filed an appeal in the U.S. court system. Since this is an encyclopedia, and since entries are not obviously dated as are newspaper articles, the provided information has been misleading, and in my opinion, has given Ms. Bozzio's page the status of that of a tabloid.\n\nI am a new editor, and I am still learning how to edit. I do agree with your June 23 comment in the history tab of Ms. Bozzio's page.\n\nPossibly an item by item edit with consensus gained along the way could result in her page being brought, in my opinion, into conformance with Wikipedia guidelines in general, and in particular, for biographies of living persons?\n\nAs a start, the result of a search engine search for Dale Bozzio's Wikipedia page results in the following:\n\n\"Dale Bozzio - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Career|Solo album|New album|Personal life Dale Bozzio's life is so strange The Boston Phoenix April 24, 2009 ... Dale Bozzio sentenced to jail The Boston Phoenix May 27, 2009 ... en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dale Bozzio - Cached\"\n\nThat information is outdated, and I believe, inappropriate for an artist whose career has spanned 30 some-odd years. I think that it should be revised to the following:\n\n\"Dale Bozzio - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Career|Solo album|New album|Personal life  Dale Bozzio is an American musician and former Playboy Bunny. She became famous as the lead singer for the '80s pop\/new wave band Missing Persons. en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dale Bozzio - Cached\"\n\nDo you know how to revise that information? [[User:Doc2234|Doc2234]] ([[User talk:Doc2234|talk]]) 20:26, 19 August 2009 (UTC)\n*Thanks for your note. I didn't know that some of that miscellaneous detail had been reinstated, but fortunately the IP was somewhat conservative. According to [[WP:BLP]], the relevant guideline for the biography of a living person, tells me the following: \"Biographies of living persons must be written conservatively, with regard for the subject's privacy. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a tabloid paper; it is not our job to be sensationalist, or to be the primary vehicle for the spread of titillating claims about people's lives.\" I take that to mean that an arrest (see the history of [[Alex Da Silva (dancer)]], for instance) or a criminal charge is NOT notable; a conviction probably is--though if it were up to me, a singer being convicted of animal cruelty has no encyclopedic value. But I realize I'm probably fighting a losing battle, as Da Silva's history makes clear. Bozzio's article right now is OK, I guess, and most editors here would probably revert cutting what's still there.<p>Your question is really about how the article shows up, and I don't think I can be of much use there. I don't know which search engine you use. Her article shows up in Google as follows: \"Dale also divorced Terry Bozzio at that time, but retained the name. Dale Bozzio has continued to record and perform since the breakup of Missing Persons. ...\" That, it seems to me, is alright--I gather you use a different search engine? [[User:Drmies|Drmies]] ([[User talk:Drmies#top|talk]]) 21:01, 19 August 2009 (UTC)\n\n::Thank you for your response. I use Yahoo. I do not have any idea as to what triggers the display of that information.\n\n::The referenced articles are from the Boston Phoenix. The written content of the articles generally covers both sides of the case. However, and that is a big ''however'' in my opinion, one article includes State's evidence photos and the others easily link to State's evidence photographs that are ''not'' presented from a neutral point of view. Readers are left to interpret for themselves what they are seeing with no explanation provided as would be afforded in the courtroom setting where the photos will be reviewed. The result from the availability of the articles and evidence has been overwhelmingly one-sided web commentary that is heavily based upon the photos, not the articles. The photos are sensationalistic.\n\n::The case is on-going with an anticipated jury trial, where jurors who will be tasked with determining guilt have to be selected, coming up in October. Is there an issue with Wikipedia being the vehicle for worldwide availability of information that should be confined to a U.S. courtroom?\n\n::Evidence is not shown or linked in the Alex Da Silva article. The article merely reports the arrest, that he is being charged, and is being held on bail.\n\n::In this particular situation with Dale Bozzio's page, with the specifics as they are, does this merit discussion? [[User:Doc2234|Doc2234]] ([[User talk:Doc2234|talk]]) 21:59, 19 August 2009 (UTC)\n:::Well, I am not sure what to tell you. I know nothing about how and why certain things show up a certain way in various search engines. Yahoo indeed presents nothing like a decent selection from the lead, but I can't tell you why that is. I did look yesterday at the ''Boston Globe'' website and searched for her; their site provides the hits from the ''Boston Phoenix'' but first lists a few from the ''Globe''--I didn't have the time to look at them, but you might could do that and see if you can replace some of the sensationalist ''Phoenix'' articles (with their stupid drawings) by more respectable entries from the ''Globe''.

This is because you have 328 edits on this account.  Generally people don't have a good chance of passing until they have at least a couple thousand edits.  Try not to get discouraged, its just that since admins can cause so much trouble if they apply policy incorrectly, people generally want to see some experience applying policy. This generally means edits to [[WP:XFD|deletion debates]], [[WP:AIV|vandal-blocking reports]] or [[WP:ANI|the admin noticeboard]].  You mayalso wish to read [[Wikipedia:Guide to requests for adminship]].  If you're serious about being an admin, I suggest you try contributing to some of those areas. In the mean time, feel free to contact me with any questions.  Also it may seem trivial, but some people might oppose you because at present, your signature takes up too much space in markup.  A good rule of thumb is 3 lines absolute maximum (240 characters), yours is 408 characters. Anyway, for now I'd be willing to do some informal coaching, but it would help if you can round up a co-coach. <font face=\"monospace\">[[User:Dgies|<font color=\"#00F\">'''&mdash;dgies'''<\/font>]]<sup>[[User talk:Dgies|t]]<\/sup><sub>[[Special:Contributions\/Dgies|c]]<\/sub><\/font> 20:31, 24 May 2007 (UTC)\n:: Thank you for the advice.

The locality has a landscaped wooded park at '''Beddington Park''' - also known as '''Carew Manor'''; and a nature reserve and sewage treatment works in the centre and to the north of its area respectively. The population of Beddington according to the 2011 census is 21,044.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Wallington, London}}\nThe village lay in [[Wallington (hundred)|Wallington]] [[hundred (county subdivision)|hundred]] and until the 19th century was in secular and ecclesiastical terms a large [[parish]] in its own right.  [[Wallington, London|Wallington]] was for centuries a [[manor]] in Beddington parish and although known as a shorthand for the area stretching from Cheam to Addington and from Chaldon to Mitcham (inclusive).<ref>{{cite web |url=http:\/\/www.british-history.ac.uk\/report.aspx?compid=43046 |title=The hundred of Wallington: Introduction and map |author=H.E.

Lavender and medicinal herbs were grown commercially in the parish. The population in 1901 was 4,812.  The parish was bounded on the north by Mitcham Common, and the three parishes of Croydon, Beddington and Mitcham met on the railway line by Beddington Lane station.<ref name=m>{{cite web |url=http:\/\/www.british-history.ac.uk\/report.aspx?compid=43048 |title=Parishes: Beddington |author=H.E.

In prehistoric times it also appears to have been the more important place, since it gave its name to the hundred. It is possible that the Roman remains mentioned above may be a relic of a formerly important place, and that its name may preserve the memory of the Wealas, the [[Roman Britain|Romanized Britons]], whom the Suthrige found here when Britain was [mostly] becoming England. In historical records, however, Wallington is not a place of importance. There was a chapel, but there is no record of a parish church. In Bishop Willis's visitation of 1725 the chapel is described as partly used for a barn, no service having taken place [in memory]. It was ruinous later in the century and was pulled down in 1797. There were extensive [[common land|common fields]], as was usual in the parishes on the north side of the chalk range. They were [[enclosure|inclosed]] under an Act of 1812. In 1835 a system of allotments was established, which seems to have flourished for a time. A few old houses remain at Wallington Corner, but none of these appear to date from earlier than the beginning of the 19th century.<ref name=m\/>}}\n\nA parish hall was built at Wallington in 1888, following its church and parish being set up in 1867 (in Beddington at the time). Holy Trinity Church school was built in 1896; the High School for girls was built in 1895 and enlarged in 1905.

Once erroneously thought to have been owned in the late 16th century by [[Sir Walter Raleigh]], an early 17th century lease shows that it was in fact owned by the Carew family as a flour mill.  In 1805 it was a snuff mill with a new owner, and it changed hands several times before being burnt down and replaced by the current building in 1891-2 by Wallis & Co as a flour mill and bakery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https:\/\/www.sutton.gov.uk\/index.aspx?articleid=1315|title=Information about the historic mill in Beddington|publisher=London Borough of Sutton|accessdate=18 October 2014}}<\/ref>\n\nThe old - 18th century or earlier - mill house remains to this day.\n\n== Beddington Park ==\n[[File:Carew Manor School, Beddington, Surrey - geograph.org.uk - 587496.jpg|thumb|left|255px|Carew Manor School, Beddington, Surrey in the London Borough of Sutton]]\n[[File:Carew manor.jpg|thumb|left|255px|Beddington Park, the former [[manor house]] of the Carew family]]\n===Carew Manor===\nBeddington Park was the former [[manor house]] of  the Carew family, lost to money lenders (see [[George Samuel Ford (bill discounter)|George Samuel Ford]]) and bad debts by Charles Hallowell Hallowell Carew in the 1850s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Re Charles Hallowel Hallowell Carew, Esquire of Beddington Park, in the county of Surrey|url=http:\/\/www.london-gazette.co.uk\/issues\/21931\/pages\/3362\/page.pdf|work=15 October 1856|publisher=London Gazette|accessdate=25 November 2013}}<\/ref>  The ''Domesday Book'' mentions two Beddington estates and these were united by [[Nicholas Carew (Lord Privy Seal)|Nicholas Carew]] to form Carew Manor in 1381.

Raleigh spent time in the [[Tower of London]] for this and Elizabeth was expelled from the court but the marriage appears to have been a genuine love-match and survived the imprisonment. A popular story is that when Raleigh was beheaded by [[James I of England|James I]] in 1618, Elizabeth claimed his embalmed head and kept it in a bag for the rest of her life. His body was buried in [[St. Margaret's, Westminster|St Margaret's, Westminster]], and after his wife's death 29 years later, Raleigh's head was returned to his tomb and interred at St. Margaret's Church.<ref>[[John Lloyd (producer)|Lloyd, J]] & [[John Mitchinson (researcher)|Mitchinson, J]]: ''The Book of General I''.<\/ref> Local myths claim the head remains in Beddington park or was inherited by his son and buried with him.\n\nThe [[Grade I]] [[listed building|listed]] [[great hall]] (or banqueting hall),<ref>[http:\/\/www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk\/en-206699-beddington-place-great-hall-only-walling Beddington Place (Great Hall Only), Sutton]<\/ref> containing a fine [[hammerbeam roof]], survives from the mediaeval house.

Appearing in the 15th century, they achieved prominence in the [[Kingdom of Imereti]] in western Georgia in the late 17th century and branched out in [[eastern Georgia]]n kingdoms of [[Kakheti]] and [[Kartli]] as well as the then-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-held southwestern region of [[Adjara]]. After the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] annexation of Georgian polities, the family was confirmed as [[Knyaz]] Abashidze ({{lang-ru|\u0410\u0431\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0434\u0437\u0435}}) by the [[Tsar]]\u2019s decree of 1825.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Abashidze family possibly derived from the medieval Georgian noble house of [[Liparitids|Liparitid-Orbeliani]], but the family legend holds that it descended from an [[Ethiopia|Abyssinian]]<ref>[[Ioane Bagrationi|Bagrationi, Ioane]] (1768-1830). [http:\/\/www.geogen.ge\/indexen.php?id_menu=12&id_menu_up=2&lang=en&id_let=34&abc=1 Abashidze]. ''The Brief Description of the Georgian Noble Houses''. Retrieved on January 16, 2010<\/ref> officer named Abash who had allegedly accompanied [[Marwan ibn Muhammad]]\u2019s [[Arab]] army to Georgia in the 8th century; Abash is said to have remained in Georgia and ennobled when he saved the life of a Georgian crown prince from a wolf.\n\nThe first recorded account about the Abashidze dates back to the latter part of the 15th century. By the 1540s, they had already been in possession of a sizeable fiefdom within the Kingdom of Imereti located in its eastern part and called Saabashidzeo (\u10e1\u10d0\u10d0\u10d1\u10d0\u10e8\u10d8\u10eb\u10d4\u10dd; literally, \"[the land] of Abashidze\"). The family reached a climax of its might at the turn of the 18th century, when it possessed 78 villages, several castles, fortresses, churches and monasteries as well as 1,500 serf households. Prince [[Giorgi-Malakia Abashidze]] was not only the most powerful vassal of the crown of Imereti, but himself acted as a kingmaker and even [[de facto]] king from 1702 to 1707. The family branched out in eastern Georgia when [[Erekle II]], [[Kingdom of Kartli and Kakheti|King of Kartli and Kakheti]], granted, in 1774, to his father-in-law Prince Zaal Abashidze and his male descendants estates in Kakheti. A branch had also been established in Kartli in the person of [[Vakhushti Abashidze]]. Earlier in the 18th century, one representative of the Imeretian line went over to the Ottoman government and settled at [[Batumi]] where his descendants attained to the office of [[sanjak-bey]].\n\nThe Russian annexation of Imereti in 1810 brought the princedom of Saabashidzeo to an end. Henceforth, the family was equated to other noble families of the Russian Empire and confirmed as princes on September 20, 1825. On July 29, 1876, Prince Simon Abashidze (1837\u20131891) was granted the right to assume the surname and coat of arms of his father-in-law, the late [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] nobleman Semen Davydovych Gorlenko, for himself and his male-line descendants (Abashidze-Gorlenko, \u0410\u0431\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0434\u0437\u0435-\u0413\u043e\u0440\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e), but he died without a male heir.\n\nThe family has survived into the 21st century and has produced several notable writers, public figures and politicians.\n\n== Notable members ==\n\n*[[Ana Abashidze]]\n*[[Aslan Abashidze]]\n*[[Giorgi-Malakia Abashidze]]\n*[[Grigol Abashidze]]\n*[[Haidar Abashidze]]\n*[[Irakli Abashidze]]\n*[[Ivane Abashidze]]\n*[[Kita Abashidze]]\n*[[Levan Abashidze (died 1757)]]\n*[[Memed Abashidze]]\n*[[Vaso Abashidze]]\n*[[Antoni (Abashidze)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n*Christopher Buyers (March - September 2003).

But the generic designation of ''Chartered Certified Accountant'' is the same for both Fellows and Associates.   [[User:Psnae|Psnae]] 03:57, 21 August 2006 (UTC)\n\nAccording to the membership titles of ICAEW and other major accountancy organization worldirde, the '''ACA''' means ''Associate Chartered Accountant'', '''FCA''' belongs to ''Fellow Chartered Accountant'', and '''CA''' means ''Chartered Accountant'', so there is also the general practise that can apply on ACCA's membership title. Moreover, according to the reply by ACCA, ACCA membership titles are truely meaining that: The title of '''ACCA''' belongs to the '''Associate Chartered Certified Accountant''' or just called '''Chartered Certified Accountant'''. And the title of '''FCCA''' means '''Fellow Chartered Certified Accountant'''.\n[[User:Lewislams|Lewislams]] 15:28, 21 August 2006 (UTC)\n\nSorry, but this is not correct.    From the [http:\/\/rulebook.accaglobal.com ACCA Rulebook], in section 2(c) of the Bye-laws (Second Schedule to the Royal Charter) it makes it clear that the designation is the same for Fellows and Associates:\n''\"Every member may denote his membership of the Association by the use of the professional designations Chartered Certified Accountant or Certified Accountant and\/or the designatory letters FCCA in the case of Fellows and ACCA in the case of Members.\"''\n\nand an extract from the Members Regulations:\n''\"A member who was admitted to membership on or after 1 January 2005 and has been a Member of the Association for a continuous period of five years shall automatically advance to fellowship, and be a Fellow, of the Association and may denote his fellowship of the Association by the use of the professional designation Chartered Certified Accountant or Certified Accountant and\/or the designatory letters FCCA\"''  [[User:Psnae|Psnae]] 03:22, 22 August 2006 (UTC)\n\n== Chinese university recognition ==\n\nA training agreement with a Chinese university to promote ACCA to students is not a \"global partnership\" [[User:Psnae|Psnae]] 04:30, 12 July 2006 (UTC)\n\n== New Zealand ==\n\nNZICA unilaterally terminated mutual recognition with ACCA.   What replaced this is not \"mutual recogition\" but at best a limited form of advanced standing.    Effectively, ACCA is no longer recognised in New Zealand.   [[User:Psnae|Psnae]] 20:03, 16 July 2006 (UTC)\n\nBut ACCA qualification is still recognised in New Zealand legislation for registration to perform statutory audit work. ACCA is gazetted under the relevant act (Under Section 199 of the Companies Act 1993: Qualifications of Auditors) in New Zealand. An ACCA member can practice as long as they hold an ACCA public practice certificate (with audit qualification) in their country of origin. In effective, ACCA is still recognised in New Zealand. \n\n[[User:FrankL906|FrankL906]] 2:41, 21 August 2006 (UTC)\n\n: But not recognised by NZICA, which is most important.   Even with practising rights, an ACCA member trying to practice in NZ without NZICA membership is at a serious professional disadvantage.   Same goes for those seeking employment, most NZ employers (other than the largest ones) won't know much about non-NZ or Australian designations.    However I accept that the term is too strong, so will change to no longer '''fully''' recognised in New Zealand.   [[User:Psnae|Psnae]] 03:52, 21 August 2006 (UTC)\n\nHowever, ACCA members can legally open the accountancy firm to provide the practising services and legally sign the audit reports in New Zealand, so you '''can't say''' ACCA is no longer fully recognised. We should say ACCA is '''statutory recognised''' in New Zealand but ACCA is not '''fully''' recognised by NZICA.\n[[User:FrankL906|FrankL906]] 14:41, 21 August 2006 (UTC)\n\n== Proposed merger : Chartered Certified Accountant ==\n\nA separate article entitled Chartered Certified Accountant has been recently created.  As Chartered Certified Accountant is the title of a member of the ACCA (and only of the ACCA) there is very little, if any, material that could be applicable to one article and not the other.\n[[User:THJames|THJames]] 20:53, 19 August 2006 (UTC)\n\nOBJECTION for proposed merger : Chartered Certified Accountant\n\nAccording to the '''general practises''' of Wikipedia, there are '''many seperated articles''' between the professional organizations and their own qualifications, such as [[CFA Institute]] and [[Chartered Financial Analyst]] (CFA) qualification, or [[Institute of Management Accountants]] (IMA) and [[Certified Management Accountant]] (CMA) qualification. \n\nMoreover, Chartered Certified Accountant is one of specific and popular accountant title in this world and also belongs to one of common name of accountancy firm (Chartered Certified Accountant Firm or CCA Firm) in United Kingdom and some commonwealth countries, such as CPA firm in United States. So it is '''benefit to reserve''' the article regarding Chartered Certified Accountant.\n\n[[User:Lewislams|Lewislams]] 1:53, 21 August 2006 (UTC)\n\n: The difference is that ''Chartered Certified Accountant'' is awarded '''only''' by ACCA, so it's pointless to have two articles describing what is essentially the same thing.    The article ''Chartered Certified Accountant'' should redirect to ACCA.    [[Certified Management Accountant]] is a generic title given by different accounting bodies, so merits a (brief) article of its own explaining this.   The same applies to the two CFA articles, they should also merge.  [[User:Psnae|Psnae]] 03:55, 21 August 2006 (UTC)\n\nSo how about [[CFA Institute]] and [[Chartered Financial Analyst]]? Actually, I think there is no matter to seperate these two articles in Wikipedia. \n[[User:FrankL906|FrankL906]] 14:50, 21 August 2006 (UTC)\n\n: Yup. The article ''Chartered Certified Accountant'' belongs to one of specific statutory accountancy qualification in United Kingdom and some commonwealth countries, but the article \"ACCA\" belongs to the whole association of ACCA. Therefore, it is '''benefit to reserve''' the article regarding ''Chartered Certified Accountant''.\n\n[[User:Lewislams|Lewislams]] 15:11, 21 August 2006 (UTC)\n\nMoreover, the articles [[Certified General Accountant]] and [[Certified General Accountants Association of Canada]] (CGA-Canada) also are seperated, accompany with the case of [[CFA Institute]] and [[Chartered Financial Analyst]], so they point out that seperated articles between the professional organizations and their own qualifications that is the '''general practises''' of Wikipedia.\n\n[[User:Lewislams|Lewislams]] 15:19, 21 August 2006 (UTC)\n\nActually, it is '''NOT''' a good proposal to merge the association and the specific qualification to be one. As you know, [[Chartered Certified Accountant]] is just one of qualification offered by [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]], anothers are Certified Accounting Technician, Diploma in Financial Management (DipFM), Diploma in International Financial Reporting...etc. However, [[Chartered Certified Accountant]] is the statutory accountancy qualification in [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], all [[EU]] countries, [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]](For auditing government institutions), [[Zimbabwe]], and some commonwealth countries, it is the specific object(qualification) that is different to the whole association of ACCA. Therefore, reserving the specific article for [[Chartered Certified Accountant]] is benefit to all readers in Wikipedia.\n\nAs same with chartered accountant, [[Chartered Certified Accountant]] is the term protected by statutory laws in [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]] and some commonwealth countries. Therefore, it is the specific meaningness to reserve the article of [[Chartered Certified Accountant]] for this purpose.\n\n<small>\u2014The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:219.76.157.19|219.76.157.19]] ([[User talk:219.76.157.19|talk]] \u2022 [[Special:Contributions\/219.76.157.19|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.<\/small>, \n\nIf the article [[Chartered Certified Accountant]] is to be retained, it needs to be purged of a lot of duplicate information.

[[User:Psnae|Psnae]] 20:39, 26 August 2006 (UTC)\n\nOBJECTION too\n\nI also think it is '''benefit to reserve''' the specific page of Chartered Certified Accountant in Wikipedia, coz Chartered Certified Accountant is one of specific accountancy qualification which is seperate to the whole association of [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]], and also seperating the articles between professional organizations and their own specific qualifications that is normal practice in Wikipedia, so I object the proposed merger too.\n\n[[User:FrankL906|FrankL906]] 2:30, 21 August 2006 (UTC)\n\nIf we are to maintain the separate articles I should like to understand what material could possibly be in one article and not the other.  Currently the article \"Chartered Certified Accountant\" contains only duplicate but slightly reworded material from the other article.

Therefore, many people from anywhere of this world especially US guys that would like to know what is ACCA and her accountancy qualification - Chartered Certified Accountant too.\n\n\nWell, I think the seperated articles of [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]] and [[Chartered Certified Accountant]] would be better because they are the descriptions of different objects.

There is no legal status as Chartered Certified in UK or any other Commonwealth Realms.  Chartered Certified is a patent name, not legal status.  I don't think when Privy Council issuing the Royal Charter to the then Association of Certified Accountants, they bore in mind that this piece of paper was half-charter.  Similarly after gaining the Chartered Status, ACCA added the Chartered prefix to the original Certified Accountants designation to reflect this status change and the body is thereafter regulated by a Royal Charter.  <small><span class=\"autosigned\">\u2014&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Lukayl|Lukayl]] ([[User talk:Lukayl|talk]] \u2022 [[Special:Contributions\/Lukayl|contribs]]) 12:37, 19 March 2016 (UTC)<\/span><\/small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->","timestamp":"20160410101623","user-timestamp":"20150410101623"},{"title":"User talk:86.180.226.14","content":"\n\n== May 2012 ==\n[[Image:Information.svg|left|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia.

For noise as a form of music, see [[noise music]].}}\n[[File:Jimi Hendrix 1967.png|thumb|[[Jimi Hendrix]] revolutionised [[rock music|rock]] and [[jazz]] by incorporating noise through techniques such as [[audio feedback|feedback]], [[distortion (music)|distortion]], [[wah-wah pedal|wah]], fuzz, [[Consonance and dissonance#Dissonance|dissonance]], and loud volume.]]\n[[File:Dolby361.jpg|thumb|A [[Dolby]] 361 A-type noise reduction module.]]\n\nIn [[music]], '''noise''' is variously described as [[Pitch (music)#Definite and indefinite pitch|unpitched]], indeterminate, uncontrolled, loud, unmusical, or unwanted sound. Noise is an important component of the sound of the [[Vocal music|human voice]] and all [[musical instrument]]s, particularly in [[unpitched percussion instrument]]s and electric guitars (using [[distortion (music)|distortion]]). [[Electronic musical instrument|Electronic instruments]] create various [[colors of noise|colours of noise]]. Traditional uses of noise are unrestricted, using all the frequencies associated with [[pitch (music)|pitch]] and [[timbre]], such as the [[white noise]] component of a [[drum roll]] on a [[snare drum]], or the [[transient (acoustics)|transient]]s present in the [[prefix (acoustics)|prefix]] of the sounds of some [[organ pipe]]s.\n\nThe influence of [[modernism]] in the early 20th century lead composers such as [[Edgar Varese]] to explore the use of noise-based sonorities in an orchestral setting. In the same period the Italian [[Futurism|Futurist]] [[Luigi Russolo]] created a \"noise orchestra\" using instruments he called [[intonarumori]]. Later in the 20th century the term [[noise music]] came to refer to works consisting primarily of noise-based sound.\n\nIn more general usage, [[noise]] is any unwanted [[sound]] or [[Audio signal|signal]]. In this sense, even sounds that would be perceived as musically ordinary in another context become noise if they interfere with the reception of a message desired by the receiver.<ref>Attali 1985, 27.<\/ref> Prevention and reduction of unwanted sound, from [[tape hiss]] to squeaking [[bass drum pedal]]s, is important in many musical pursuits, but noise is also used creatively in many ways, and in some way in nearly all [[genre]]s.\n\n{{TOC limit|5}}\n\n==Definition of noise==\n{{See also|Music}}\nIn conventional musical practices sounds that are considered ''unmusical'' tend to be treated as noise.<ref>Scholes 1970, 10, 686.<\/ref> ''Oscillations and Waves'' defines noise as irregular vibrations of an object, in contrast to the periodical, patterned structure of music.<ref>Reddy, Badami, Balasubramanian 1994, 206.<\/ref> More broadly, electrical engineering professor [[Bart Kosko]] in the introductory chapter of his book ''Noise'' defines noise as a \"signal we don't like.\"<ref>Kosko 2006, 3.<\/ref> [[Paul Hegarty (musician)|Paul Hegarty]], a lecturer and noise musician, likewise assigns a subjective value to noise, writing that \"noise is a judgment, a social one, based on unacceptability, the breaking of norms and a fear of violence.\"<ref>Hegarty 2006.<\/ref> Composer and music educator [[R. Murray Schafer]] divided noise into four categories: Unwanted noise, unmusical sound, any loud system, and a disturbance in any signaling system.<ref>Kouvaras 2013.{{page needed|date=June 2014}}<\/ref>\n\nIn regard to what is noise as opposed to music, Robert Fink in ''The Origin of Music: A Theory of the Universal Development of Music'' claims that while cultural theories view the difference between noise and music as purely the result of social forces, habit, and custom, \"everywhere in history we see man making some selections of some sounds as noise, certain other sounds as music, and in the ''overall development'' of all cultures, this distinction is made around the ''same'' sounds.\"<ref>Fink 1981, 25.<\/ref> However, musicologist [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]] considers the difference between noise and music nebulous, explaining that \"The border between music and noise is always culturally defined\u2014which implies that, even within a single society, this border does not always pass through the same place; in short, there is rarely a consensus&nbsp;... By all accounts there is no ''single'' and ''intercultural'' universal concept defining what music might be.\"<ref>Nattiez 1990, 48, 55.<\/ref>\n\n==Noise as a feature of music==\nMusical tones produced by the human voice and all acoustical musical instruments incorporate noises in varying degrees. Most consonants in human speech (e.g., the sounds of ''f'', ''v'', ''s'', ''z'', both voiced and unvoiced ''th'', Scottish and German ''ch'') are characterised by distinctive noises, and even vowels are not entirely noise free. Wind instruments include the whizzing or hissing sounds of air breaking against the edges of the mouthpiece, while bowed instruments produce audible rubbing noises that contribute, when the instrument is poor or the player unskilful, to what is perceived as a poor tone. When they are not excessive, listeners \"make themselves deaf\" to these noises by ignoring them.<ref>Helmholtz 1885, 67\u201368.<\/ref>\n\n===Unpitched percussion===\n{{Main|Unpitched percussion instrument}}\n[[File:Colorful Maracas.JPG|thumb|[[Maracas]] owe their distinctive tone to the noise in their sound]]\nMany [[unpitched percussion instrument]]s, such as the [[snare drum]] or [[maracas]], make use of the presence of random sounds or ''noise'' to produce a sound without any perceived [[pitch (music)|pitch]].<ref>Maconie 2005, 84.<\/ref><ref>Hopkin 1996, 2, 92.<\/ref> See [[Timbre#Envelope|timbre]]. Unpitched percussion is typically used to maintain a [[rhythm]] or to provide [[accent (music)|accent]]s, and its sounds are unrelated to the [[melody]] and [[harmony (music)|harmony]] of the music. Within the [[orchestra]] unpitched percussion is termed [[auxiliary percussion]], and this subsection of the [[percussion section]] includes all unpitched instruments of the orchestra no matter how they are played, for example the [[pea whistle]] and [[siren (instrument)|siren]].\n\n===Traditional music===\n\n====Antiquity====\n\nAlthough percussion instruments were generally rather unimportant in [[ancient Greek music]], two exceptions were in dance music and ritual music of orgiastic cults. The former required instruments providing a sharply defined rhythm, particularly ''[[crotalum|krotala]]'' (clappers with a dry, nonresonant sound) and ''kymbala'' (similar to [[Zill|finger-cymbals]]). The cult rituals required more exciting noises, such as those produced by drums, cymbals, jingles, and the ''rhombos'' ([[Bullroarer (music)|bull-roarer]]), which produced a demonic roaring noise particularly important to the ceremonies of the priests of [[Cybele]].<ref>Mathiesen 2001; West 1992, 122.<\/ref> [[Athenaeus]] (''[[The Deipnosophists]]'' xiv.38) quotes a passage from a now-lost play, ''Semele'', by Diogenes the Tragedian, describing an all-percussion accompaniment to some of these rites:\n:And now I hear the turban-wearing women,\n:Votaries of th' Asiatic Cybele,\n:The wealthy Phrygians' daughters, loudly sounding\n:With drums, and rhombs, and brazen-clashing cymbals,\n:Their hands in concert striking on each other,\n:Pour forth a wise and healing hymn to the gods.<ref>Athenaeus 1854, 3:1015.<\/ref>\nAn altogether darker picture of the function of this noise music is painted by [[Livy]] in ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'' xxxix.8\u201310, written in the late first century BC. He describes \"a Greek of mean condition&nbsp;... a low operator in sacrifices, and a soothsayer&nbsp;... a teacher of secret mysteries\" who imported to [[Etruria]] and then to Rome a [[Dionysian Mysteries|Dionysian cult]] which attracted a large following. All manner of debaucheries were practised by this cult, including rape and {{Quote|secret murders&nbsp;... [where] the bodies could not even be found for burial. Many of their audacious deeds were brought about by treachery, but most of them by force, and this force was concealed by loud shouting, and the noise of drums and cymbals, so that none of the cries uttered by the persons suffering violation or murder could be heard abroad.<ref>Livy 1823, 5:297\u201398.<\/ref>}}\n\n====Polynesia====\n\nA Tahitian traditional dance genre dating back to before the first contact with European explorers is ''[['ote'a|\u02bb\u014dte\u02bba]]'', danced by a group of men accompanied solely by a drum ensemble. The drums consist of a slit-log drum called ''t\u014d\u2018ere'' (which provides the main rhythmic pattern), a single-headed upright drum called ''fa\u2018atete'', a single-headed hand drum called ''pahu tupa\u2018i rima'', and a double-headed bass drum called ''tariparau''.<ref>Stillman 2001.<\/ref>\n[[File:Binus Operet 24-10-2009 Yangge.JPG|thumb|right|Traditional [[Yangge]] dance performances are accompanied by unpitched percussion ensembles (Dream Butterfly Dance Group (\u8776\u68a6\u821e\u56e2) pictured here).]]\n\n====Asia====\n\nIn [[Shaanxi]] in the north of China, drum ensembles accompany ''[[yangge]]'' dance, and in the [[Tianjin]] area there are ritual percussion ensembles such as the ''Fagu hui'' Dharma-drumming associations, often consisting of dozens of musicians.<ref>Jones 2001.<\/ref> In Korea, a style of folk music called ''Nongak'' (farmers' music) or ''[[pungmul]]'' has been performed for many hundred years, both by local players and by professional touring bands at concerts and festivals. It is loud music meant for outdoor performance, played on percussion instruments such as the drums called ''janggu'' and ''puk'', and the gongs ''ching'' and ''[[kkwaenggwari]]''. It originated in simple work rhythms to assist repetitive tasks carried out by field workers.<ref>Provine 2001.<\/ref>\n\n[[File:ChendaPlayingGroup.jpg|thumb|left|Ensemble of ''chenda'' and ''elathalam'' performers]]\nSouth Asian music places a special emphasis on drumming, which is freed from the primary time-keeping function of drumming found in other part of the world.<ref>Qureshi, et al. 2001, \u00a7I, 2 (i)<\/ref> In North India, secular processional bands play an important role in civic festival parades and the ''b\u0101r\u0101t'' processions leading a groom's wedding party to the bride's home or the hall where a wedding is held. These bands vary in makeup, depending on the means of the families employing them and according to changing fashions over time, but the core instrumentation is a small group of percussionists, usually playing a frame drum (''\u1e0daphal\u0101''), a gong, and a pair of kettledrums (''nag\u0101\u1e5b\u0101''). Better-off families will add shawms ([[shehnai]]) to the percussion, while the most affluent who also prefer a more modern or fashionable image may replace the traditional ensemble with a brass band.<ref>Qureshi, et al. 2001, \u00a7VII, 1, (d)<\/ref> The Karnatic music of southern India includes a tradition of instrumental temple music in the state of [[Kerala]], called ''k\u1e63\u0113tram v\u0101dyam''. It includes three main genres, all focussed on rhythm and featuring unpitched percussion. ''[[Thayambaka]]'' in particular is a virtuoso genre for unpitched percussion only: a solo double-headed cylindrical drum called [[chenda]], played with a pair of sticks, and accompanied by other ''chenda'' and [[elathalam]] (pairs of cymbals). The other two genres, [[panchavadyam]] and [[pandi melam]] add wind instruments to the ensemble, but only as accompaniment to the primary drums and cymbals. A ''panchavadyam'' piece typically lasts about an hour, while a ''pandi melam'' performance may be as long as four hours.<ref>Qureshi, et al. 2001, \u00a7VII, 2, (ii), (a).<\/ref>\n\n====Turkey====\n\n[[File:Mehterhane.jpg|thumb|left|Turkish ''mehter\u00e2n'', or janissary band]] \nThe Turkish [[Janissary|janissaries]] military corps had included since the 14th century [[Military band|bands]] called ''mehter'' or ''[[Ottoman military band|mehter\u00e2n]]'' which, like many other earlier military bands in Asia featured a high proportion of drums, cymbals, and gongs, along with trumpets and shawms. The high level of noise was pertinent to their function of playing on the battlefield to inspire the soldiers.<ref>Pirker 2001.<\/ref> The focus in these bands was on percussion. A full ''mehter\u00e2n'' could include several bass drums, multiple pairs of cymbals, small kettledrums, triangles, tambourines, and one or more [[Turkish crescent]]s.<ref>Blades 1996, 265.<\/ref>\n\n====Europe====\n\nThrough Turkish ambassadorial visits and other contacts, Europeans gained a fascination with the \"barbarous\", noisy sound of these bands, and a number of European courts established \"Turkish\" military ensembles in the late-17th and early 18th centuries. The music played by these ensembles, however, were not authentically Turkish music, but rather compositions in the prevalent European manner.<ref>Meyer 1974, 484\u201385.<\/ref> The general enthusiasm quickly spread to opera and concert orchestras, where the combination of bass drum, cymbals, tambourines, and triangles were collectively referred to as \"Turkish music\". The best-known examples include Haydn's [[Symphony No. 100 (Haydn)|Symphony No. 100]], which acquired its nickname, \"The Military\", from its use of these instruments, and three of Beethoven's works: the \"alla marcia\" section from the finale of his [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9]] (an early sketch reads: \"end of the Symphony with Turkish music\"), his \"[[Wellington's Victory]]\"\u2014or ''Battle'' Symphony\u2014with picturesque sound effects (the bass drums are designated as \"cannons\", side drums represent opposing troops of soldiers, and [[Ratchet (instrument)|ratchets]] the sound of rifle fire), and the \"Turkish March\" (with the expected bass drum, cymbals, and triangle) and the \"Chorus of Dervishes\" from his incidental music to ''[[The Ruins of Athens]]'', where he calls for the use of every available noisy instrument: castanets, cymbals, and so forth.<ref>Blades 1996, 266\u201367.<\/ref><ref>Montagu 2002, 108\u201310.<\/ref><ref>Sachs 2010, 65.<\/ref> By the end of the 18th century, the ''batterie turque'' had become so fashionable that keyboard instruments were fitted with devices to simulate the bass drum (a mallet with a padded head hitting the back of the sounding board), cymbals (strips of brass striking the lower strings), and the triangle and bells (small metal objects struck by rods). Even when percussion instruments were not actually employed, certain ''alla turca'' \"tricks\" were used to imitate these percussive effects. Examples include the \"Rondo alla turca\" from Mozart's [[Piano Sonata No. 11 (Mozart)|Piano Sonata, K. 331]], and part of the finale of his [[Violin Concerto No. 5 (Mozart)|Violin Concerto, K. 219]].<ref>Meyer 1974, 486\u201387.<\/ref>\n\n=====Harpsichord, piano, and organ=====\n[[File:Giuseppe Verdi by Giovanni Boldini.jpg|left|thumb|\n[[Giuseppe Verdi]], who used noise in the form of a [[tone cluster]] in ''[[Otello]]''.\n]]\nAt about the same time that \"Turkish music\" was coming into vogue in Europe, a fashion for programmatic keyboard music opened the way for the introduction of another kind of noise in the form of the keyboard [[Tone cluster|cluster]], played with the fist, flat of the hand, forearm, or even an auxiliary object placed on the keyboard. On the harpsichord and piano, this device was found mainly in \"battle\" pieces, where it was used to represent cannon fire. The earliest instance was by [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Dandrieu]], in ''Les Caract\u00e8res de la guerre'' (1724), and for the next hundred years it remained predominantly a French feature, with examples by  [[Michel Corrette]] (''La Victoire d'un combat naval, remport\u00e9e par une fr\u00e9gate contre plusieurs corsaires r\u00e9unis'', 1780), [[Claude-B\u00e9nigne Balbastre]] (''March des Marseillois'', 1793), Pierre Antoine C\u00e9sar (''La Battaille de Gemmap, ou la prise de Mons'', ca. 1794), and Jacques-Marie Beauvarlet-Charpentier (''Battaille d'Austerlitz'', 1805). In 1800, Bernard Viguerie introduced the sound to chamber music, in the keyboard part of a [[piano trio]] titled ''La Bataille de Maringo, pi\u00e8ce militaire et historique''.<ref>Henck 2004, 32\u201350.<\/ref> The last time this pianistic \"cannon\" effect was used before the 20th century was in 1861, in a depiction of the then-recent [[First Battle of Bull Run|The Battle of Manassas]] in a piece by the black American piano virtuoso [[Blind Tom Wiggins|\"Blind Tom\" Bethune]], a piece that also feature vocalised sound-effect noises.<ref>Gates and Higginbotham 2004, 85.<\/ref>\n\nClusters were also used on the organ, where they proved more versatile (or their composers more imaginative). Their most frequent use on this instrument was to evoke the sound of thunder, but also to portray sounds of battle, storms at sea, earthquakes, and Biblical scenes such as the fall of the walls of Jericho and visions of the apocalypse. The noisy sound nevertheless remained a special sound effect, and was not integrated into the general texture of the music. The earliest examples of \"organ thunder\" are from descriptions of improvisations by [[Georg Joseph Vogler|Abb\u00e9 Vogler]] in the last quarter of the 18th century. His example was soon imitated by [[Justin Heinrich Knecht]] (''Die durch ein Donerwetter'' {{sic}} ''unterbrochne Hirtenwonne'', 1794), Michel Corrette (who employed a length of wood on the pedal board and his elbow on the lowest notes of the keyboard during some improvisations), and also in composed works by Guillaume Lasceux (''Te Deum'': \"Judex crederis\", 1786), Sigismond Neukomm (''A Concert on a Lake, Interrupted by a Thunderstorm''), [[Louis James Alfred Lef\u00e9bure-W\u00e9ly]] (''Sc\u00e8ne pastorale'', 1867), Jacques Vogt (''Fantaisie pastorale et orage dans les Alpes'', ca. 1830), and Jules Blanc (''La procession'', 1859).<ref>Henck 2004, 41\u201345.<\/ref> The most notable 19th-composer to use such organ clusters was [[Giuseppe Verdi]]. The storm music which opens his opera ''[[Otello]]'' (1887) includes an organ cluster (C, C{{Music|sharp}}, D) that is also the longest notated duration of any scored musical texture.<ref>Henck 2004, 56; Kimbell 1991, 606.<\/ref>\n\n=====Bowed strings=====\n[[File:Heinrich Biber.png|thumb|Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber introduced noises into string music for programmatic effects]]\nPercussive effects in imitation of drumming had been introduced to bowed-string instruments by early in the 17th century. The earliest known use of ''[[col legno]]'' (tapping on the strings with the back of the bow) is found in [[Tobias Hume]]'s ''First Part of Ayres'' for unaccompanied [[viola da gamba]] (1605), in a piece titled ''Harke, Harke''.<ref>Walls 2001, \u00a72 xi.<\/ref> [[Carlo Farina]], an Italian violinist active in Germany, also used ''col legno'' to mimic the sound of a drum in his ''Capriccio stravagante'' for four stringed instruments (1627), where he also used devices such as ''[[glissando]]'', [[tremolo]], [[pizzicato]], and ''[[sul ponticello]]'' to imitate the noises of barnyard animals (cat, dog, chicken).<ref>Newman 1972, 207; Pyron and Bianco 2001.<\/ref> Later in the century, [[Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber]], in certain movements of ''Battalia'' (1673), added to these effects the device of placing a sheet of paper under the A string of the double bass, in order to imitate the dry rattle of a snare drum, and in \"Die liederliche Gesellschaft von allerley Humor\" from the same programmatic battle piece, superimposed eight different melodies in different keys, producing in places dense orchestral clusters. He also uses the percussive snap of fortissimo ''pizzicato'' to represent gunshots.<ref>Arnold 1994, 54.<\/ref>\n\nAn important aspect of all of these examples of noise in European keyboard and string music before the 19th century is that they are used as [[sound effects]] in programme music. Sounds that would likely cause offense in other musical contexts are made acceptable by their illustrative function. Over time, their evocative effect was weakened as at the same time they became incorporated more generally into abstract musical contexts.<ref>Arnold 1994, 56\u201357.<\/ref>\n\n=====Orchestras=====\n\n[[Orchestra]]s continued to use noise in the form of a [[percussion section]], which expanded though the 19th century: [[Berlioz]] was perhaps the first composer to thoroughly investigate the effects of different mallets on the tone color of [[timpani]].<ref name=exploringmusic>Hast, Cowdery, and Scott 1999, 149.<\/ref> However, before the 20th century, percussion instruments played a very small role in orchestral music and mostly served for punctuation, to highlight passages, or for novelty. But by the 1940s, some composers were influenced by non-Western music as well as [[jazz]] and [[popular music]], and began incorporating [[marimba]]s, [[vibraphone]]s, [[xylophone]]s, bells, [[gong]]s, [[cymbal]]s, and drums.<ref name=exploringmusic \/>\n{{clear}}\n\n=====Vocal music=====\n\nIn vocal music, noisy nonsense syllables were used to imitate battle drums and cannon fire long before [[Cl\u00e9ment Janequin]] made these devices famous in his programmatic chanson ''La bataille'' (The Battle) in 1528.<ref>Arnold 1994, 53.<\/ref> Unpitched or semi-pitched performance was introduced to formal composition in 1897 by [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]], in the first version of his [[melodrama]], ''[[K\u00f6nigskinder]]''. This style of performance is believed to have been used previously by singers of [[lieder]] and popular songs. The technique is best known, however, from somewhat later compositions by [[Arnold Schoenberg]], who introduced it for solo voices in his ''[[Gurrelieder]]'' (1900\u201311), ''[[Pierrot Lunaire]]'' (1913), and the opera ''[[Moses und Aron]]'' (1930\u201332), and for chorus in ''Die Gl\u00fcckliche Hand'' (1910\u201313). Later composers who have made prominent use of the device include [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Luciano Berio]], [[Benjamin Britten]] (in ''[[Death in Venice (opera)|Death in Venice]]'', 1973), [[Mauricio Kagel]], and [[Wolfgang Rihm]] (in his opera ''[[Jakob Lenz (opera)|Jakob Lenz]]'', 1977\u201378, amongst other works).<ref>Griffiths 2001.<\/ref> A well-known example of this style of performance in popular music was [[Rex Harrison]]'s portrayal of Professor Henry Higgins in ''[[My Fair Lady]]''.<ref>Kennedy 2006.<\/ref> Another form of unpitched vocal music is the speaking chorus, prominently represented by [[Ernst Toch]]'s 1930 ''[[Geographical Fugue]]'', an example of the [[Gebrauchsmusik]] fashionable in Germany at that time.<ref>Oechsler 2001.<\/ref>\n\n=====Machine music=====\n[[File:Edgard Varese.gif|left|thumb|283x283px|[[Edgard Var\u00e8se]], who explored noise in an orchestral setting.]]\nIn the 1920s a fashion emerged for composing what was called \"machine music\"\u2014the depiction in music of the sounds of factories, locomotives, steamships, dynamos, and other aspects of recent technology that both reflected modern, urban life and appealed to the then-prevalent spirit of objectivity, detachment, and directness. Representative works in this style, which features motoric and insistent rhythms, a high level of dissonance, and often large percussion batteries, are [[George Antheil]]'s ''[[Ballet m\u00e9canique]]'' (1923\u201325), [[Arthur Honegger]]'s ''[[Pacific 231]]'' (1923), [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s ballet ''[[Le pas d'acier (Prokofiev)|Le pas d'acier]]'' (The Steel Leap, 1925\u201326), [[Alexander Mosolov]]'s ''[[Iron Foundry]]'' (an orchestral episode from his ballet ''Steel'', 1926\u201327), and [[Carlos Ch\u00e1vez]]'s ballet ''[[Caballos de vapor]]'', also titled ''HP'' (Horsepower, 1926\u201332). This trend reached its apex in the music of [[Edgard Var\u00e8se]], who composed ''[[Ionisation (Var\u00e8se)|Ionisation]]'' in 1931, a \"study in pure sonority and rhythm\" for an ensemble of thirty-five unpitched percussion instruments.<ref>Machlis 1979, 154\u201356, 357.<\/ref>\n\n=====Percussion ensembles=====\n\nFollowing Var\u00e8se's example, a number of other important works for [[percussion ensemble]] were composed in the 1930s and 40s: [[Henry Cowell]]'s ''Ostinato Pianissimo'' (1934) combines Latin American, European, and Asian percussion instruments; [[John Cage]]'s ''[[First Construction (in Metal)]]'' (1939) employs differently pitched thunder sheets, brake drums, gongs, and a water gong; Carlos Ch\u00e1vez's ''Toccata for Percussion'' (1943) requires six performers to play a large number of European and Latin-American drums and other unpitched percussion together with a few tuned instruments such as xylophone, tubular chimes, and glockenspiel; [[Lou Harrison]], in works such as the ''Canticles'' nos. 1 and 3 (1940 and 1942), ''Song of Queztalcoatl'' (1941), Suite for Percussion (1942), and\u2014in collaboration with John Cage\u2014''Double Music'' (1941) explored the use of \"found\" instruments, such as brake drums, flowerpots, and metal pipes. In all of these works, elements such as timbre, texture, and rhythm take precedence over the usual Western concepts of harmony and melody.<ref>Miller and Hanson 2001; Holland and Page 2001.<\/ref>\n\n===Experimental and avant-garde music===\n[[File:Prepared piano board Neumann.jpg|thumb|Prepared piano]]\nUse of noise was central to the development of [[experimental music]] and [[avant-garde music]] in the mid 20th century. Noise was used in important, new ways.\n\nEdgard Var\u00e8se challenged traditional conceptions of musical and non-musical sound and instead incorporated noise based sonorities into his compositional work, what he referred to as \"organised sound.\"<ref>Goldman 1961.<\/ref> Var\u00e8se stated that \"to stubbornly conditioned ears, anything new in music has always been called noise\", and he posed the question, \"what is music but organized noises?\".<ref>Var\u00e8se and Chou 1966, {{Page needed|date=May 2014}}.<\/ref>\n\nIn the years immediately following the First World War, [[Henry Cowell]] composed a number of piano pieces featuring [[tone cluster]]s and [[String piano|direct manipulation of the piano's strings]]. One of these, titled ''The Banshee'' (1925), features sliding and shrieking sounds suggesting the terrifying cry of the [[banshee]] from Irish folklore.<ref name=simms317>Simms 1986, 317.<\/ref>\n\nIn 1938 for a dance composition titled ''Bacchanale'', [[John Cage]] invented the [[prepared piano]], producing both transformed pitches and colorful [[unpitched]] sounds from the piano.<ref name=simms319>Simms 1986, 319\u201320.<\/ref> Many variations, such as [[prepared guitar]], have followed.<ref>Rhodes and Westwood 2008, 184.<\/ref> In 1952, Cage wrote ''[[4\u203233\u2033]]'', in which there is no deliberate sound at all, but only whatever background noise occurs during the performance.\n\n[[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] employed noise in vocal compositions, such as ''[[Momente]]'' (1962\u201364\/69), in which the four choirs clap their hands, talk, and shuffle their feet, in order to mediate between instrumental and vocal sounds as well as to incorporate sounds normally made by audiences into those produced by the performers.<ref name=simms374>Simms 1986, 374.<\/ref>\n\n[[Robert Ashley]] used [[audio feedback]] in his avant-garde piece ''The Wolfman'' (1964) by setting up a howl between the microphone and loudspeaker and then singing into the microphone in way that modulated the feedback with his voice.<ref name=fractals \/>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Electronic music===\n[[File:Roland-100M-150 hg.jpg|thumb|left|109x240px|[[Roland System-100M]] modular synthesizer with ring modulator, noise generator, sample & hold, LFO]]\n[[File:Minimoog Voyager (left panel).jpg|thumb|Some of the [[Minimoog Voyager]] controls.

In a process opposite to the building up of sine tones into complexes, white noise could be [[Filter (signal processing)|filtered]] to produce sounds with different [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidths]], called \"[[Colors of noise|coloured noises]]\", such as the speech sounds represented in English by ''sh'', ''f'', ''s'', or ''ch''. An early example of an electronic composition composed entirely by filtering white noise in this way is [[Henri Pousseur]]'s ''[[Scambi]]'' (Exchanges), realised at the [[Studio di fonologia musicale di Radio Milano|Studio di Fonologia]] in Milan in 1957.<ref>Stockhausen 1963b, 144\u201345.<\/ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, electronic [[white noise machine]]s became commercially available.<ref>Anon. n.d.}<\/ref> These are used alone to provide a pleasant background noise and to mask unpleasant noise, a similar role to conventional [[background music]].<ref name=overstimulation>Heller 2003, 197.<\/ref> This usage can have health applications in the case of individuals struggling with [[over-stimulation]] or [[sensory processing disorder]].<ref name=overstimulation \/><ref>Fast 2004, 233.<\/ref> Also, white noise is sometimes used to mask sudden noise in facilities with [[animal testing|research animals]].<ref>Hessler and Lehner 2008, 72.<\/ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Rock music===\n[[File:Ts9-stompbox-2-2.jpg|thumb|Ibanez Tube Screamer TS9, an example of an overdrive pedal]]\nWhile the electric guitar was originally designed to be simply [[Guitar amplifier|amplified]] in order to reproduce its sound at a higher volume,<ref>Bacon 1981, 142.<\/ref>  guitarists quickly discovered the creative possibilities of using the amplifier to modify the sound, particularly by extreme settings of tone and volume controls.<ref name=rhfuzz>Bacon 1981, 119<\/ref>\n\nDistortion was at first produced by simply overloading the amplifier to induce [[clipping (audio)|clipping]], resulting in a tone rich in harmonics and also in noise, and also producing [[dynamic range compression]] and therefore sustain (and sometimes destroying the amplifier).

Buel says \"ran directly counter to the values of mainstream music of the time.\"<ref name=\":2\">Buel 2013, 118, 120.<\/ref> He explains that \"without a doubt\" this intentional use of noise influenced not only the next decade of hip-hop, but of rock as well.<ref name=\":2\" \/> Furthermore, notes Buel, the incorporation of noise served a political function, elevating the ordinary and thus suggesting that common, ordinary people should consider themselves on the same footing as their political and cultural leaders.<ref name=\":2\" \/>\n\n==Noise as a type of music==\n[[File:Intonarumori-schema.gif|thumb|Construction drawing for one of Russolo's ''intonarumori'']] \n[[File:Boredoms-1.jpg|thumb|[[Japanoise]] band [[The Boredoms]]]]\n{{Main|Noise music}}\n\nNoise music (also referred to simply as noise) has been represented by many genres during the 20th century and subsequently. Some of its proponents reject the attempt to classify it as a single overall [[genre]],<ref>\"With the vast growth of Japanese noise, finally, noise music becomes a genre\u2014a genre that is not one, to paraphrase Luce Irigaray\" (Hegarty 2007, 133).<\/ref> preferring to call noise music a ''non-genre'', an ''aesthetic'', or a collection of genres. Even among those who regard it as a genre, its scope is unclear.<ref>Wolf 2009, 67: \"The genre noise music does not have a proper definition\".<\/ref> Some commentators use the phrase \"noise music\" (or \"noise\") to refer specifically to Japanese noise music, while others instead use the term [[Japanoise]].<ref>Minor 2004, 291.<\/ref><ref>Gottlieb and McLelland 2003, 60.<\/ref>\n\nWhile noise music is often nowadays associated with extreme volume and distortion<ref>Piekut 2011, 193.<\/ref> and produced by electronic amplification, the tradition dates back at least to the Futurist Luigi Russolo,<ref name=lr>Russolo 1913.<\/ref> who rejected melody, constructed original instruments known as intonarumori and assembled a \"noise orchestra\" in 1917. It was not well received.<ref>Hegarty 2007, 13\u201314.<\/ref> In his 1913 manifesto ''[[The Art of Noises]]'' he observes:\n<blockquote>At first the art of music sought purity, limpidity and sweetness of sound. Then different sounds were amalgamated, care being taken, however, to caress the ear with gentle harmonies. Today music, as it becomes continually more complicated, strives to amalgamate the most dissonant, strange and harsh sounds. In this way we come ever closer to noise-sound.<ref name=lr \/><\/blockquote>\n\n===Some types of noise music===\n* [[Noise music]], abandoning melody, harmony, and sometimes even pulse and rhythm\n* [[Industrial music]] (1970s)\n* [[Noise rock]] and [[noise pop]] (1980s)\n* [[Japanoise]] (late 1970s - current)\n* [[Glitch (music)|Glitch]] (1990s)\n\n==Noise reduction==\n{{main|Noise reduction}}\n[[File:Dolby-E Hardware.jpg|thumb|[[Dolby noise reduction|Dolby noise-reduction system]] hardware]]\nMost often, musicians are concerned not to produce noise, but to minimise it. [[Noise reduction]] is of particular concern in [[sound recording]]. This is accomplished by many techniques, including use of low noise components and proprietary noise reducing technologies such as [[Dolby]].<ref>Dolby Laboratories  n.d.<\/ref>\n\nIn both recording and in live musical [[sound reinforcement]], the key to noise minimisation is [[headroom (audio signal processing)|headroom]]. Headroom can be used either to reduce [[distortion]] and [[audio feedback]] by keeping signal levels low,<ref>Amyes 1998, 60.<\/ref><ref name=crossovers417>Self 2011, 417.<\/ref> or to reduce [[Electromagnetic interference|interference]], both from outside sources and from the [[Johnson-Nyquist noise]] produced in the equipment, by keeping signal levels high.<ref name=crossovers411>Self 2011, 411\u201329, 510\u201311.<\/ref> Most proprietary noise reducing technologies also introduce low levels of distortion. Noise minimisation therefore becomes a compromise between interference and distortion, both in recording and in live music, and between interference and feedback in live amplification.<ref name=crossovers417 \/> The work of [[Bart Kosko]] and Sanya Mitaim has also demonstrated that [[stochastic resonance]] can be used as a technique in noise minimisation and signal improvement in [[Dynamic system#Nonlinear dynamical systems and chaos|non-linear dynamical system]]s, as the addition of noise to a signal can improve the signal-to-noise ratio.<ref>Kosko, Mitaim 1998, 2152.<\/ref>\n\nNoise created by [[mobile phone]]s has become a particular concern in [[Concert|live performance]]s, particularly those being recorded. In one notable incident, [[maestro]] [[Alan Gilbert (conductor)|Alan Gilbert]] halted the [[New York Philharmonic]] in a performance of [[Gustav Mahler]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 9]] until an audience member's [[iPhone]] was silenced.<ref>Associated Press 2012.<\/ref>\n\n==Noise as excessive volume==\n{{Main|Loud music}}\n{{See also2|[[Noise pollution]]|[[noise regulation]]|[[noise-induced hearing loss#among musicians]]|[[health effects from noise]]|[[loudest band in the world]]}}\n[[File:Dror Feiler 2.jpg|left|thumb|240x240px|[[Dror Feiler]], whose composition ''Halat Hisar'' was dropped from a world premiere by [[Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra]] after many of the musicians claimed it was too loud to perform.]]\nMusic played at excessive volumes is often considered a form of [[noise pollution]].<ref>Avison 1989, 469.<\/ref> Governments such as that of the [[United Kingdom]] have local procedures for dealing with noise pollution, including loud music.<ref>Directgov<\/ref>\n\nNoise as high volume is common for musicians from [[orchestra|classical orchestras]] to [[rock band|rock groups]] as they are exposed to high [[decibel]] ranges.<ref>Jansson and Karlsson 1983.<\/ref><ref>Maia and Russo 2008,{{Page needed|date=May 2012}}.<\/ref> Although some rock musicians experience noise-induced hearing loss from their music,<ref>Anon. 2006b.<\/ref> it is still debated as to whether classical musicians are exposed to enough high-intensity sound to cause [[hearing impairment]]s.<ref>Ostri, Eller, Dahlin, and Skylv 1989, pp. 243\u201349<\/ref> Nevertheless, in 2008 Trygve Nordwall, the manager of the [[Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra]], invoked new EU rules forbidding more than 85 decibels in the workplace, as a reason for dropping the planned world premiere of [[Dror Feiler]]'s composition ''Halat Hisar ''(State of Siege) because it was \"adverse to the health\" of the musicians. The twenty-minute piece begins with a burst of machine-gun fire, and gets louder. Readings taken during rehearsals measured at least 130 decibels, and some members of the orchestra reported suffering headaches and permanent [[Tinnitus|tinnitis]] after sustained exposure for three hours during rehearsals. Earplugs for the musicians were suggested, but they objected they could not hear each other and the composer also rejected the idea, adding that his composition was \"no louder than anything by Shostakovich or Wagner\".<ref>Anon. 2008; Connolly 2008.<\/ref>\n\nMusic-induced hearing loss is still a [[controversial]] topic for hearing researchers.<ref name=tm>Morata 2007.<\/ref> While some studies have shown that the risk for [[hearing loss]] increases as music exposure increases, other studies found little to no correlation between the two.<ref name=tm\/>\n\nMany bands, primarily in the [[rock music|rock]] genre, use excessive volumes intentionally.

It was adapted by [[Talbot Jennings]], [[Tess Slesinger]], and [[Claudine West]] from the play by [[Owen Davis]] and [[Donald Davis (writer)|Donald Davis]], which was in itself based on the 1931 [[The Good Earth|novel of the same name]] by [[Nobel Prize]]-winning author [[Pearl S. Buck]]. The film was directed by [[Sidney Franklin (director)|Sidney Franklin]], with uncredited contributions by [[Victor Fleming]] and [[Gustav Machaty]].\n\nThe film stars [[Paul Muni]] as Wang Lung. For her role as his wife O-Lan, [[Luise Rainer]] won an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. The film also won the [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography]] for [[Karl Freund]].  It was nominated for [[Academy Award for Directing|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. Its [[world premiere]] was at the elegant [[Carthay Circle Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn pre-[[World War I]] northern China, a young farmer Wang Lung ([[Paul Muni]]) marries O-Lan ([[Luise Rainer]]), a lowly servant at the Great House, the residence of the most powerful family in their village. O-Lan proves to be an excellent wife, hard working and uncomplaining. Wang Lung prospers. He buys more land, and O-Lan gives birth to two sons and a daughter. Meanwhile, the Great House begins to decline.\n\nAll is well until a drought and the resulting famine drive the family to the brink. Desperate, Wang Lung considers the advice of his pessimistic, worthless uncle ([[Walter Connolly]]) to sell his land for food, but O-Lan opposes it. Instead, they travel south to a city in search of work. The family survives by begging and stealing. When a revolutionary gives a speech to try to drum up support for the army approaching despite rain in the north, Wang Lung and O-Lan realize the drought is over. They long to return to their farm, but they have no money for an ox, seed, and food.\n\nThe city changes hands, and O-Lan joins a mob looting a mansion. However, she is knocked down and trampled upon. When she comes to, she finds a bag of jewels overlooked in the confusion. This windfall allows the family to go home and prosper once more. O-Lan asks only to keep two pearls for herself.\n\nYears pass. Wang Lung's sons grow up into educated young men, and he has grown so wealthy that he purchases the Great House. Then, Wang Lung becomes besotted with Lotus ([[Tilly Losch]]), a pretty, young dancer at the local [[tea house]], and makes her his second wife. He begins to find fault with the worn-out O-Lan. Desperate to gain affection from Lotus, he gives O-Lan's pearls to Lotus.\n\nWhen Wang Lung discovers that Lotus has seduced Younger Son ([[Roland Lui]]), he orders his son to leave. Then a swarm of [[locust]]s threatens the entire village. Using a strategy devised by Elder Son ([[Keye Luke]]), everyone unites to try to save the crops. Just when all seems lost, the wind shifts direction, taking the danger away. The near-disaster brings Wang Lung back to his senses. He reconciles with Younger Son. On the latter's wedding day, Wang Lung returns the pearls to O-Lan before she dies, exhausted by a hard life.  Without disturbing the wedding festivities, Wang Lung quietly exits the house and regards a flowering peach tree planted by O-Lan on their marriage day.  Reverently he murmurs, \"O-Lan, you are the earth.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{|\n|-\n| '''[[Image:Paul Muni in The Good Earth trailer 2.jpg|80px]] || [[Paul Muni]] as Wang ||'''[[Image:Tilly Losch in The Good Earth trailer.jpg|80px]]''' ||[[Tilly Losch]] as Lotus\n|-\n| '''[[Image:Luise Rainer in The Good Earth trailer 2.jpg|80px]]''' ||[[Luise Rainer]] as O-Lan ||'''[[Image:Charley Grapewin in The Good Earth trailer.jpg|80px]]''' ||[[Charley Grapewin]] as Old Father\n|-\n| '''[[Image:Walter Connolly in The Good Earth trailer.jpg|80px]]''' ||[[Walter Connolly]] as Uncle ||'''[[Image:Jessie Ralph in The Good Earth trailer.jpg|80px]]''' ||[[Jessie Ralph]] as Cuckoo\n|-\n|}\n\n{|\n|-\n|[[Soo Yong]]\n|as Aunt\n|-\n|[[Keye Luke]]\n|as Elder Son\n|-\n|[[Roland Lui]]\n|as Younger Son\n|-\n|[[Suzanna Kim]]\n|as Little Fool\n|-\n|[[Ching Wah Lee]]\n|as Ching\n|-\n|[[Harold Huber]]\n|as Cousin\n|-\n|[[Olaf Hytten]]\n|as Liu grain merchant\n|-\n|William Law\n|as Gateman\n|-\n|[[Mary Wong]]\n|as Little Bride\n|-\n|}\n\n===Unbilled===\n*[[Charles Middleton (actor)|Charles Middleton]] (banker), [[Chester Gan]] (singer in tea house), [[Richard Loo]] (farmer), [[Kam Tong]] (peasant), [[Victor Sen Yung]] (peasant), [[Philip Ahn]] (revolutionary army captain), [[Bessie Loo]], [[Clarence Lung]], [[Sammee Tong]]\n\n==Production==\nThe film's budget was $2.8 million, a small fortune at the time, and took three years to make. A five-hundred-acre farm in [[Porter Ranch, Los Angeles, California|Porter Ranch, California]], was transformed into a replica of Chinese farmland for this film.<ref name=\"Roar140\">{{citation\n|last1=H\u00e1y\n|first1=Pete\n|authorlink=Peter H\u00e1y\n|title=MGM: When the Lion Roars\n|year=1991\n|publisher=Turner Publishing, Inc.\n|location=Atlanta\n|isbn=1-878685-04-X\n|page=140\n}}<\/ref>\n\nThe movie script was more sympathetic to China than the novel had been. Wang Lung\u2019s son was now a representative of modern China who goes to university and leads the villagers. The family is a wholesome affectionate unit, even the uncle who in the novel exploits Wang Lung, and the sexual aspect of Lotus is played down. The [[Motion Picture Production Code|Hays office]], which supervised each Hollywood script, demanded more than twenty rewrites to eliminate what it found offensive.<ref>Hoban, James L., Jr., \u201cScripting The Good Earth: Versions of the Novel for the Screen,\u201d in Elizabeth Johnston Lipscomb, Frances E. Webb, Peter J. Conn, eds., ''The Several Worlds of Pearl S. Buck'' (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1994).<\/ref> Before Herbert Stothart and Edward Ward were engaged to provide the music, negotiations took place with Austrian composer [[Arnold Schoenberg]], who is known to have made some musical sketches for the score before the plan fell through.\n\nPearl Buck intended the film to be cast with all Chinese or Chinese-American actors. [[Irving Thalberg]] also envisioned casting only Chinese actors, but had to concede that American audiences were not ready for such a film. Though [[Anna May Wong]] had been suggested for the role of O-Lan, the [[Hays Code]] anti-[[miscegenation]] rules required Paul Muni's character's wife to be played by a white actress.<ref>Hodges, Graham Russell.

However, some of the supporting cast did include Chinese American actors.\n\nWhen MGM inquired into the possibility of making the film in China, the Chinese government was divided on how to respond. Initial hostility derived from resentment of the novel, which critics charged focused only on the perceived backwardness of the country while some government officials hoped to have control which would be gone if the film work was done outside China. Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]] himself intervened, perhaps at the behest of his wife, [[Soong Mei-ling|Mme. Chiang]], whose American education made her an advocate for cooperation. Permission was granted on condition that the view of China be favorable, that Chinese government would supervise and have approval of shots done in China, and the unenforced stipulation that the entire cast be Chinese. The government in Nanjing did not foresee the sympathy the film would create and when MGM decided to shoot on location in China officials took extraordinary steps to control the production, forcing the studio to hire a Nationalist general to advise them on authentic settings and costumes (most of this footage was mysteriously lost when it was shipped home and had to be re-shot in California). There were reports that MGM distributed a different version of the film in China <ref>Zhiwei Xiao,  \u201cNationalism, Orientalism, and an Unequal Treatise of Ethnography: The Making of ''The Good Earth'',\u201d  in Suzie Lan Cassell, ed., ''From Gold Mountain to the New World: Chinese American Studies in the New Millennium'' (Alta Mira, 2002), pp. 277\u201379, 283\u201384.<\/ref>\n\nThe film's 1936 production lasted from February 28 to July 23. Thalberg died on September 14, four-and-a-half months before its [[Los Angeles]] premiere on January 29, 1937. The film credits stated that this was his \"last great achievement\".<ref>Hay, Peter.

You know, as much as I love color films, and have been bedazzled by the color in movies like ''[[The Red Shoes (1948 film)|The Red Shoes]]'', ''[[Blood and Sand (1941 film)|Blood and Sand]]'' \u2014 nineteen forties, ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]'', ''[[Ziegfeld Follies (film)|Ziegfeld Follies]]'' of nineteen forty-six, I have to say there\u2026 there isn't anything more beautiful than a great black-and-white movie\u2026 to me, something about the play of light and shadow draws me into a film more than color cinematography does. Well, film historian and author [[Wheeler Winston Dixon]] agrees on that subject and he says so emphatically in this slim new book called ''Black and White Cinema: A Short History''. It's a book that looks at black-and-white cinematography from its origins through its heyday. It's also a book that inspired our lineup of films for the next few hours \u2014 those films being some of the most beautiful black-and-white films ever made. Well, our first black-and-white film on this October Wednesday is one which earned cinematographer Karl Freund an Academy Award for his work. It's ''The Good Earth'' from MGM in nineteen thirty-seven, made eight years after Freund immigrated to Hollywood from Germany, where he learned his craft in the German film industry before World War Two broke out. Freund had already photographed dozens of films, including the landmark German film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''. Well, in Hollywood, he first made waves with Universal's black-and-white horror classic ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]''. By the time he made this next film about ''The Good Earth'', he was under contract to MGM in Hollywood, which meant he had the full power of the [[Tiffany & Co.|Tiffany]] of movie studios for support in telling this story. ''The Good Earth'' stars Paul Muni and Luise Rainer and is an adaptation of the novel by Pearl S. Buck \u2014 all about the struggles of family of farmers in rural China. It was one of the last movies made by MGM production chief Irving Thalberg, before his sudden death in nineteen thirty-six. Thalberg was a workaholic and poured himself into every detail of his productions and, for this film, he sent an expedition of researchers to China to search for eighteen tons of furniture, farm equipment and other authentic material. Thalberg then had a walled city built a farm near [[Chatsworth, California]], complete with a man-made river and fields filled with real Chinese vegetables. I mean, it was a mammoth, multimillion-dollar undertaking and, thanks to Karl Freund's amazing cinematography, you'll be seeing ninety-five percent of those dollars right up there on the screen. Here's the movie, from nineteen thirty-seven\u2026 ''The Good Earth''.\"\n\n==Dedication at the start of opening credits==\n\"to the memory of<br>\nIrving Grant Thalberg<br>\nwe dedicate this picture<br>\nHis Last Great Achievement\"\n\n==Introduction at the end of opening credits==\n\"The soul of a great nation<br>\nis expressed in the life<br>\nof its humblest people,<br>\nin this simple story of a<br>\nChinese farmer may be found<br>\nsomething of the soul of<br>\nChina ~ its humility, its<br>\ncourage, its deep heritage<br>\nfrom the past and its vast<br>\npromise for the future.\"\n\n==See also==\n*[[Whitewashing in film]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|The Good Earth (film)}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0028944|title=The Good Earth}}\n* {{AFI film|8507|The Good Earth}}\n* {{Amg movie|20287|The Good Earth}}\n* {{tcmdb title|182|The Good Earth}}\n\n{{Sidney Franklin}}\n{{Irving Thalberg}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Good Earth, The}}\n[[Category:1937 films]]\n[[Category:1930s romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on plays]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Sidney Franklin]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Gustav Machat\u00fd]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Actress Academy Award-winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Irving Thalberg]]\n[[Category:Films set in China]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Beijing]]\n[[Category:Films shot in China]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles, California]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Utah]]\n[[Category:Films whose cinematographer won the Best Cinematography Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films]]\n[[Category:Films based on adaptations]]\n[[Category:Film scores by Herbert Stothart]]","timestamp":"20160410101635","user-timestamp":"20150410101635"},{"title":"User talk:Cheeky960","content":"\n\n\n== Greetings... ==\n<p>Hello, Cheeky960, and '''''[[Wikipedia:Welcoming committee\/Welcome to Wikipedia|welcome to Wikipedia!]]'''''\n: To get started, click on the link that says \"welcome\".\n:: I (and the rest of us here, too!) hope you like it here and decide to stay!\n::: Happy editing!

He moved to [[Texas]] in 1846 and fought in a cavalry regiment in the Mexican\u2013American War. In 1854 he moved to [[California]], where he was admitted to the bar, practicing in [[Los Angeles]]. Following the killing of Sheriff [[James R. Barton]] by the [[Flores Daniel Gang]], Coopwood led twenty-six [[El Monte, California|El Monte]] men, as a division of the posse in the manhunt for the gang. <ref>[http:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=RjEPAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA498&lpg=#v=onepage&q&f=false  [[Hubert Howe Bancroft]], '''Popular tribunals, Volume 1''', History Company, San Francisco, 1887, p.500]<\/ref>\n\nIn 1857, at the age of thirty he came to [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]] as part of a syndicate that purchased the balance of the [[Rancho San Bernardino]] from [[Ebenezer Hanks]] for $18,000.<ref>Some of the settlers, being Josephites and not in sympathy with Young's policy or the practice of polygamy, remained in the valley, and the remainder of the church property was placed in the hands of Ebenezer Hanks, who had previously purchased a one-third interest in the grant, and who later sold the property to Richard G. Allen. F. L. Tucker, W. A. Conn and Bethel Coopwood. John Brown, James Boyd, ''History of San Bernardino and Riverside counties'', p. 48<\/ref>  Hanks had previously purchased a one-third interest in the grant, with [[Amasa Lyman]] and [[Charles C. Rich]] leaders of the Mormon colonists of San Bernardino from the original grantee [[Jos\u00e9 del Carmen Lugo]]. \n\nCoopwood remained in San Bernardino until 1861, as realtor and a lawyer and with an excellent knowledge of Spanish and a number of Mexican clients, most of whom were very well off.<ref>John Brown, James Boyd, '''History of San Bernardino and Riverside counties''', p. 122<\/ref> Coopwood although of southern sympathies himself, sheltered the pro Union Doctor Ainsworth in his own home from a mob of pro southern sympathies and was wounded in the shootout that was the climax of the 1859 \"[[Ainsworth-Gentry Affair]].\" <ref>John Brown, James Boyd, '''History of San Bernardino and Riverside counties''', p. 148<\/ref>  That same year he married Josephine Woodward and they eventually had fourteen children.  \n\nIn the bitterly contested campaign of 1860, [[Charles W. Piercy]] was nominated for member of the 1st District of the California General Assembly by one party, and W. A. Conn the incumbent, by the other.  Piercy was elected, but there was a claim of fraud.  The accusation was that polls at [[Rancho Temescal (Serrano)|Temescal]], maintained by a resident named James Greenwade, kept open shop for three weeks and that whenever candidate Piercy was in need of more votes, they were furnished from this precinct. The case was taken to court, where the two opposing lawyers, H. M. Willis and Bethel Coopwood, had a fight in court wherein Coopwood sustained a slight wound, but won the case.<ref>John Brown, James Boyd, ''History of San Bernardino and Riverside counties'', p. 148-149  Later in 1861 Piercy was killed in a duel with another assemblyman, [[Daniel Showalter]].<\/ref> \n\n=== Civil War ===\nIn 1861, Coopwood disposed of his interests in California and returned to Texas. He entered the [[Confederate Army]] as a captain in the cavalry and served until 1863. In 1861, he formed the [[San Elizario Spy Company]] or Coopwood Spy Company, an Independent Volunteer Company of cavalry with men that came with him from California. He commanded the Confederate forces in the [[Battle of Canada Alamosa]], largest of several small battles that occurred in [[Confederate Arizona]] near the border with [[New Mexico]] Territory. He and his company served in Sibley's [[New Mexico Campaign]]. He was ill with smallpox during the [[Battle of Valverde]] but recovered in time to join the army at the [[Battle of Albuquerque]] and the [[Battle of Peralta]]. He was responsible for saving the remnants of Sibley's army, 1800 men, from Union pursuit by finding a path for them through the rugged mountains west of the [[Rio Grande]] to the [[Mesilla Valley]]. He was later promoted to Major and then Lt. Colonel.<ref>[http:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=B62efyszvF8C Jerry D.

He returned to Texas and became recognized as an able lawyer and Spanish scholar in the lower [[Rio Grande]] valley. He contributed articles to and wrote book reviews for early issues of the Texas State Historical Association Quarterly, in which he published \"Notes on the History of La Bah\u00eda del Esp\u00edritu Santo\" in 1898\u201399 and \"The Route of Cabeza de Vaca\" in 1899\u20131900.

Path Press was not planned to be an ongoing [[publishing house]]. However, it now turns out that there remains sufficient worthwhile materials from the writings of the Venerable [[Nanavira Thera|Ven. \u00d1\u0101\u1e47av\u012bra Thera]] to issue other volumes to the present work; and there are a few other writings, unpublished or now out of print, which, like ''Clearing the Path'', are of high quality, worthy of publication or reprinting. Therefore, it was established a publishing house, called 'Path Press Publications'.\n\nThese writings are probably not commercially viable; nor do they represent the views of any established sect, school or university which might sponsor their publication. The idea has been put forward that inasmuch as Path Press has already published one book of this type it could use that experience as a basis for issuing those occasional writings which are of exceptional merit and yet do not attract established publishers.\n\n== Clearing the Path (1960\u20131965) ==\n[[Image:Nanavira_Thera.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Nanavira Thera|Ven. \u00d1\u0101\u1e47av\u012bra Thera]].]]\nClearing the Path was the most important work for Path Press. \n\nIn 1963, \u00d1\u0101\u1e47av\u012bra Thera completed a book called '''''Notes on Dhamma''''' (1960\u20131963), which was privately published by the Honourable Lionel Samaratunga in the same year (250 copies). Following production of that volume, the author amended and added to the text, leaving at his death an expanded [[typescript]], indicated by the titular expansion of its dates, (1960\u20131965). ''Notes on Dhamma'' has been variously described as \"arrogant, scathing, and condescending\",<ref>''op. cit.,'' p.161 (Letter 3)<\/ref> as \"a fantastic system\", and as \"the most important book to be written in this century\". \u00d1\u0101\u1e47av\u012bra Thera himself remarked of the book that \"it is vain to hope that it is going to win general approval... but I do allow myself to hope that a few individuals... will have private transformations of their way of thinking as a result of reading them\".<ref>''op. cit.,'' p.353 (Letter 84)<\/ref> \n\nAnd the influence of ''Notes on Dhamma'' on [[Buddhist]] thinkers continues to increase more than three decades after its publication. This book has aroused extreme interest and controversy. The ''Notes'' \"attempt to provide an intellectual basis for the understanding of the Suttas without abandoning ''saddh\u0101'' (faith)\";<ref>''op. cit.,'' p.305 (Letter 60)<\/ref> that they \"have been written with the purpose of clearing away a mass of dead matter which is choking the Suttas\";<ref>''op. cit.,'' p.339 (Letter 76)<\/ref> and that, above all, \"the ''Notes'' are designed to be an invitation to the reader to come and share the author's point of view\". The ''Notes'' assume that the reader's sole interest in the ''[[Pali]] [[Suttas]]'' is a concern for his own welfare. However, the ''Notes'', with their admitted intellectual and conceptual difficulties, are not the only way to discuss right view or to offer right-view guidance. \n\n'''''Letters''''' are a selection of 150 letters written by \u00d1\u0101\u1e47av\u012bra Thera from his ''kuti'' in the Bundala Forest Reserve to local and foreign readers of the ''Notes'' who had requested explanation and clarification. Some are thinly disguised essays in a wholly modern idiom. The letters which are collected and published in ''Clearing the Path'' are not only something of a commentary on the ''Notes''; they are, independently, a lucid discussion of how an individual concerned fundamentally with self-disclosure deals with the [[dilemma]] of finding himself in an intolerable situation, where the least undesirable alternative is [[suicide]].\n\nWith openness, calmness, and considerable wit \u00d1\u0101\u1e47av\u012bra Thera discusses with his [[correspondents]] (including his doctor, a judge, a provincial businessman, a barrister, a British diplomat, and another British citizen) the [[illnesses]] that plague him and what he can and cannot do about them, and about his own [[existence]]. His life as a [[Buddhist monk]] in a remote jungle abode is not incidental to the [[philosophy]] he expounds: the two are different aspects of the same thing, namely a vision that penetrates into the human situation both as universal and as particular, and recognizes that it is this situation which it is the business of each of us to resolve for ourselves. In presenting this view \u00d1\u0101\u1e47av\u012bra Thera offers a contemporary exposition of the Teaching of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. In living this view he evokes a dramatic situation wherein an individual resolutely faces those questions which every lucid person must eventually face. The letters are in [[language]], [[idiom]] and quotations from a galaxy of thinkers such as [[Albert Camus|Camus]], [[Heidegger]], [[Kierkegaard]], [[Sartre]], [[Kafka]]. Though familiar to a Western reader, it can be incomprehensible in part, to anyone without such background.\n\nMost of the editorial work connected with \u00d1\u0101\u1e47av\u012bra Thera's writings was performed by [[Samanera Bodhesako|S\u0101manera Bodhesako]] (Robert Smith), who died in [[Kathmandu]] in 1988. During the last years of his life in [[Sri Lanka]] he founded Path Press which published ''Clearing the Path: Writings of \u00d1\u0101\u1e47av\u012bra Thera (1960-1965)''.

In the past these dogs were bred by hunters on the Piedmontese hills. The strict selection resulted in an extremely skilled and clever scenthound. Very few pure specimens remain today.\n\nSIPS, the Italian Association for Scenthounds, has created a Committee of experts to get  official recognition of the breed Piccolo Lepraiolo Italiano and to set a common standard. The best examples are the Cravin.\n\nGeneral appearance:\nIt is a medium or small sized [[dog]] of robust constitution with a thick coat, but a slender build with good [[muscle]]s and strong bones. It has a shy and reserved temperament, and does not make a fuss.\n\nWorking habits\nDynamic, enthusiastic and tireless, the Cravin can work in all kinds of ground. Its [[gait]] of choice is the [[trot (horse gait)|trot]], while searching, which is light, energetic, easy, alternating with some [[Horse gait#Gallop|galloping]]. It follows scents scrupulously, and does not waste time on dubious ones. The dog shows initiative,  and conclusive action. It announces what it has found with vibrant movements of the tail which hits the hips, then through a high sharp voice. It can work alone or even better in pairs.\n\nSize of males 47 to 50&nbsp;cm.\n\n== External Links ==\n\n*[http:\/\/eng.agraria.org\/dog\/segugiodicravin.htm Segugio Cravin Photos]\n\n{{Italian dogs}}\n\n[[Category:Dog breeds]]\n[[Category:Dog breeds originating in Italy]]\n[[Category:Hounds]]","timestamp":"20160410101642","user-timestamp":"20150410101642"},{"title":"User talk:70.53.49.33","content":"==David Cameron==\n\nI notice you've reverted a vandal who was changing the photograph of David Cameron for one of Hitler - thanks for that.

Norwood Gardens was planned and developed during a period of expansion in [[New York City]].\n\nWith the opening of the Queensboro Bridge in 1909 and the extension of the IRT subway service to Ditmars Boulevard in 1915, Astoria and Long Island City were forever changed from outlying suburbs to centrally connected communities. \n\nFifteen minutes by subway to Grand Central Terminal, Norwood Gardens held great appeal to both professional and working-class families.\n\nThe Queens Chamber of Commerce published sales brochures advertising Norwood Gardens as \u201cCountry Living In The City\u201d. The houses were developed by Rickert Brown and designed to offer middle-income families a better quality of life than that typically found in a large, metropolitan city in the early part of the century.\n\nNorwood Gardens includes many two-family detached homes, a unique block of one-family attached homes east side of 37th Street and thirty unique attached terrace homes on 36th Street. The 36th Street homes were popularly called Doctor\u2019s Row due to doctors combining their practice offices under their living quarters.\n\nThe 36th Street terrace homes were designed by Walter Hopkins. Hopkins was an architect with Warren & Wetmore, a prominent architectural firm of the late 19th to early 20th century responsible for the design of Grand Central Station as well as other notable buildings.\n\nThe thirty attached terrace homes showcased 25-foot front gardens planted with California privet hedges, over 22 kinds of evergreens (many 10\u201312 feet tall) and a large variety of flowering shrubs.\n\nNorwood Gardens\u2019 homes were designed to provide circulating fresh air and sunlight. The interior floor plans maximized use of space, making the homes attractive to families.\nThe exterior design is a lively combination of white stucco and red tapestry brick. The mortar is a mix of bright white lime with a quartz aggregate that sparkles and accentuates the brick. Additional architectural elements include iron balconies, lattice work, green blinds, cement flower pots on the roof, red Italianate tiles, planter supports in the shape of lambs heads and a variety of architectural medallions embedded in the brick.\n\nThe original bathroom fixtures were manufactured by J. L. Mott Iron Works of Manhattan; the J.L Mott for whom Mott Street in Chinatown was named after.\nIn 1929, Norwood Gardens terrace homes sold for $15,000 and the slightly larger corner homes for $16,000. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company underwrote the mortgages for the terrace homes.\n\nTwenty-nine exteriors of the thirty terrace homes remain in near original state. \n\n== Today ==\nLargely unspoiled by development, the planned community of Norwood Gardens is still a low-rise residential neighborhood. The green city trees and front gardens of 35th, 36th and 37th Streets create a special district in Astoria. Neighborhoods such as Norwood Gardens have been rapidly disappearing in the recent Queens development boom.\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite news|title=Norwood Gardens Colony|date=July 2, 1922|accessdate=March 13, 2010|publisher=[[New York Times]]|url=http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9402E2DB1039E133A25751C0A9619C946395D6CF}}\n* Rickert-Brown Co.

[[Ute people|Ute]] [[warrior]]s also played a significant role in the conflict as they were allied with the Jicarillas. The war started  when the Apaches and Utes began raiding against settlers on the [[Santa Fe Trail]]. Eventually, in 1853, the American army retaliated which resulted in a series of battles and campaigns that ended in 1854 when a large military expedition managed to quell most of the violence. However, some minor skirmishing contiuned into 1855.<ref>Tiller, \"The Jicarilla Apache Tribe: a history, 1846-1970\"<\/ref><ref>http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/oldguardmuseum\/3694655329\/<\/ref>\n\n==War==\nDolores Gunnerson argues that \"the Jicarillas would have transferred their allegiance to the Americans and served them as faithfully as they had served the Spaniards if the Anglos had been willing to accept them as \"friends\" and allies.\" She further states that \"the Jicarilla were at war with the United States for only a year and a half and spent nearly all that period eluding the troops rather than fighting.\"  <ref>Gunnerson, Dolores A.,  ''The Jicarilla Apaches: a study in survival'', Northern Illinois University Press, DeKalb, Illinois, 1974, p.295<\/ref>\n\nThe war began in 1849 when a wagon of settlers was killed by a band of Jicarillas and Utes. The event, sometimes referred to as the [[White Massacre]] received considerable publicity at the time and did much to prejudice the Anglo population against the tribe. A year later a group of [[mail]] carriers were killed in what is called the Wagon Mound Massacre. Various incidents in the next half decade would raise the tensions between the Americans and the Jicarillas, leading both sides to increasingly mistrust the other until the winter of 1853 to 1854 when the army began operations.<ref name=\"Friend\"\/>\n\nIn February 1854 a government beef contractor near [[Fort Union National Monument|Fort Union]], New Mexico  reported to the army that several of his cattle had been stolen by the Jicarillas so in response, a troop of [[dragoon]]s from the [[2nd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|2nd Cavalry]] were sent to retrieve the stolen property. On March 5, Lieutenant Bell encountered a group of warriors under [[tribal chief|Chief]] Lobo Blanco, out on the [[Canadian River]]. It was uncertain whether Lobo Blanco and his followers were responsible for the stolen property but the army had long suspected Lobo Blanco's band of killing white and [[Hispanic]] settlers. A battle then ensued which left the chief and four of his warriors dead while the Americans lost two men. On the next day, the conflict escalated when a band of Jicarillas and Utes raided a herd of cattle near Fort Union, killing two herdsmen in the process. After that the [[United States Army]] [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st Cavalry Regiment]] launched an expedition into [[Comancheria#Apacheria|Apacheria]]. The first engagement was fought on March 30 when [[First Lieutenant]] [[John Davidson (general)|John Davidson]]'s launched an unauthorized attack on a Jicarilla village near the present day [[Pilar, New Mexico|Pilar]], New Mexico.<ref>http:\/\/musketoon.com\/2005\/01\/17\/muster-rolls-battle-of-cieneguilla-30-march-1854\/<\/ref>\n\nIn the subsequent [[Battle of Cieneguilla]], sixty American [[cavalry]]men fought an estimated 250 Apaches and Ute [[warrior]]s under the [[tribal chief|war chief]] [[Flechas Rayada]]. Fighting began at around 8:00 am and lasted for over three hours, by the end of which, twenty-two soldiers were killed and another thirty-six were wounded. Davidson's command was forced to retreat having inflicted about twenty deaths on the native force. A week later, on April 8, a large force of about 200 American cavalrymen, 100 men of the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry]], and thirty-two [[United States Army Indian Scouts|scouts]], found the Jicarillas of Chief [[Chacon (Apache)|Chacon]] in [[Ojo Caliente, New Mexico|Ojo Caliente Canyon]]. During the [[Battle of Ojo Caliente Canyon|battle]] that followed, commander [[Philip St. George Cooke]] defeated about 150 warriors, killing five of them and wounding six others without sustaining any casualties to his own command. The Jicarillas where dispersed at that point and without a camp many of them died in the extreme cold weather. The battle was also notable for having involved [[Kit Carson]], who guided the American army during the expedition, and [[First Lieutenant]] [[George Sykes]], who later commanded the [[Army of the Potomac]] in the [[American Civil War]]. After the Ojo Caliente battle the war was mostly over with the exception of a few smaller raids and skirmishes over the next several months.<ref>Carver, pg. 134-139<\/ref><ref>Utley, pg. 144<\/ref><ref>Carter, pg.134-139<\/ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|last=Tiller|first=Veronica E.|title=The Jicarilla Apache Tribe: a history, 1846-1970|year=1983|location=|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=0-8032-4409-6}}\n*{{cite book|last=Utley|first=Robert M.|title=Frontiersmen in blue: the United States Army and the Indian, 1848-1865|year=1981|location=|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=0-8032-9550-2}}\n*{{cite book|last=Carter|first=Harvey L.|title= \"Dear Old Kit\": The Historical Christopher Carson|year=1990|location=|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=0-8061-2253-6}}\n*{{cite book\n|last=The Friend|first=|authorlink=|title=The Friend Volume 74|publisher=|series=\n|year=1901|doi=\n|isbn=}}\n\n[[Category:Apache Wars|Jicarilla]]\n[[Category:Indian wars of the American Old West|Jicarilla]]\n[[Category:New Mexico Territory|Jicarilla]]\n[[Category:Battles involving the Apache|Jicarilla]]\n[[Category:Wars involving the United States|Jicarilla]]\n[[Category:1849 in New Mexico Territory]] \n[[Category:1850 in New Mexico Territory]] \n[[Category:1853 in New Mexico Territory]] \n[[Category:1854 in New Mexico Territory]] \n[[Category:1855 in New Mexico Territory]]\n[[Category:19th-century military history of the United States|Jicarilla]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1849]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1850]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1853]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1854|Jicarilla]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1855|Jicarilla]]","timestamp":"20160410101656","user-timestamp":"20150410101656"},{"title":"User talk:Lionessg","content":"== June 2014 ==\n\nHello, and [[Wikipedia:Introduction|welcome to Wikipedia]]!

Jourdan's army would push southeast from D\u00fcsseldorf, hopefully drawing troops and attention toward themselves, which would allow Moreau\u2019s army an easier crossing of the Rhine between Kehl and H\u00fcningen. According to plan, Jourdan\u2019s army feinted toward Mannheim, and Charles quickly reapportioned his troops. Moreau\u2019s army attacked the bridgehead at Kehl, which was guarded by 7,000 imperial troops\u2014troops recruited that spring from the [[Swabian Circle|Swabian circle]] polities, inexperienced and untrained\u2014which amazingly held the bridgehead for several hours, but then retreated toward Rastatt. On June 23\u201324, Moreau [[Battle of Kehl (1796)|reinforced]] the bridgehead with his forward guard. After pushing the imperial militia from their post on the bridgehead, his troops poured into Baden unhindered. Similarly, in the south, by Basel, Ferino\u2019s column moved speedily across the river and proceeded up the Rhine along the Swiss and German shoreline, toward Lake Constance and into the southern end of the Black Forest. Anxious that his supply lines would be overextended, Charles began a retreat to the east.<ref>Dodge, p.290.  See also {{de icon}} Charles, Archduke of Austria. ''Ausgew\u04d3hlte Schriften weiland seiner Kaiserlichen Hoheit des Erzherzogs Carl von \u00d6sterreich'', Vienna: Braum\u00fcller, 1893\u201394, v. 2, pp. 72, 153\u2013154.<\/ref>\n\nAt this point, the inherent jealousies and competition between generals came into play.  Moreau could have joined up with Jourdan\u2019s army in the north, but did not; he proceeded eastward, pushing Charles into Bavaria.  Jourdan also moved eastward, pushing Wartensleben\u2019s autonomous corps into the Ernestine duchies and neither general seemed willing to unite his flank with his compatriot's.<ref name=Dodge292>Dodge, pp. 292\u2013293.<\/ref>  There followed a summer of strategic retreats, flanking, and reflanking maneuvers.  On either side, the union of two armies\u2014Wartensleben\u2019s with Charles\u2019 or Jourdan\u2019s with Moreau\u2019s\u2014could have crushed the opposition.<ref name=Dodge297>Dodge, pp. 297.<\/ref> Wartensleben and Charles united first, and the tide turned  against the French. With 25,000 of his best troops, the Archduke crossed to the north bank of the [[Danube]] at [[Regensburg]] and moved north to join his colleague Wartensleben.The defeat of Jourdan's army at the [[Battle of Amberg|Amberg]], [[Battle of W\u00fcrzburg|W\u00fcrzburg]] and [[Battle of Altenkirchen|Altenkirchen]] allowed Charles to move more troops to the south. The next contact occurred on 19 October at Emmendingen.,<ref name=Rickard>J.

The section of the valley involved  in the battle runs south-west through the mountains from Elzach, through  Bleibach and Waldkirch. Just to the southwest of Waldkirch, the river emerges  from the mountains and flows north-west towards the  Rhine, with the Black Forest to its right.  This section of the river passes through Emmendingen before it reaches [[Riegel am Kaiserstuhl|Riegel]]. Riegel sits in a narrow gap between the Black Forest and an isolated outcropping of volcanic hills known as the [[Kaiserstuhl (Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg)|Kaiserstuhl]].<ref name=Rickard\/>\n[[File:Malterdingen 03.800.jpg|thumbnail|left|This aerial picture of Malterdingen depicts the hilly and forested terrain surrounding the village.]]\n[[File:Elzfall.jpg|thumbnail|left|Rocky outcroppings, streams, and small falls complicate passage through the rough terrain]]\n[[File:Elz (Waldkirch) jm7772.jpg|thumbnail|Heavy rains brought the Elz to flood stage by 19 October.]]\n\n==Dispositions==\nOn the left wing, under command of Desaix, the Division St. Suzanne (9 Battalion and 12 squadrons,) stood by Riegel, on both shores of the Elz.  On the right of these, by Malterdingen, the Division Beaupuy, with 12 battalions and 12 squadrons.  And Further to the right, by Emmendingen itself, and in the heights by Heimbach, stood St. Cyr; around this stretched the Duhesme's Division (12 battalions and eight squadrons).  Further to the right of these, in the Elz valley by Waldkirch, the Division of Ambert and the brigade Girard; by Z\u00e4hringen, about a mile away, Lecourbe's brigade stood in reserve, and stretching northward from there, was a mounted division of 14,000 horses, in the vicinity of Holzhausen.  These positions created a line about {{convert|3|mi|0|sp=us|adj=yes}} long.  On the far side of Lecorbe's brigade stood Ferino's 15 battalions and 16 squadrons in the mountains. He debouched through the H\u00f6ll valley.  Everyone had been hampered by heavy rains; the ground was soft and spongy, and the Rhine and Elz rivers had flooded.  This increased the hazards of mounted attack, because the horses could not get a good footing.<ref name=Ersch>{{de icon}} Johann Samuel Ersch, [https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=iHg0ANM1wC8C&dq=Allgemeine+encyclop%C3%A4die+der+wissenschaften+und+k%C3%BCnste+in+alphabetischer+folge+von+genannten+schrifts+bearbeitet+und+herausgegeben+von+J.+S.+Ersch+und+J.+G.+Gruber%22&source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Allgemeine encyclop\u00e4die der wissenschaften und k\u00fcnste in alphabetischer folge von genannten schrifts bearbeitet und herausgegeben''].

Column Nauendorf, in the upper Elz, had eight battalions and 14 squadrons, advancing southwest to Waldkirch; column Wartensleben had 12 battalions and 23 squadrons advancing south to capture the Elz bridge at Emmendingen. Latour, with 6,000 men, was to cross the foothills via Heimbach and Malterdingen, and capture the bridge of K\u00f6ndringen, between Riegel and Emmendingen, and column [[Karl Aloys zu F\u00fcrstenberg|F\u00fcrstenberg]] held Kinzingen, about {{convert|2|mi|km|sp=us}} north of Riegel. Fr\u00f6lich and Cond\u00e9 (part of Nauendorf's column) were to pin down Ferino and the French right wing in the Stieg valley.<ref name=Ersch\/>\n\n==Battle==\nThe French, being the first to arrive on the scene, secured the high point at Waldkirch, which commanded the neighboring valleys.

Even if the topic does have encyclopedic value, and if it even justifies an article or coverage somewhere else, then it's ''way'' overboard to have a section this size, with such a vague title. That's the sort of response we should reserve for, \"Future staff eat kittens\".\n: However there does seem to be some issue here. Future ''surely'' have editorial control over BikeRadar? Particularly as much of this story (see [[Streisand effect]]) seems to be that Future pulled the story from the BikeRadar website, after it was criticised. <strike>Now that does seem to have more relevance to Future PLC.<\/strike>\n:I'll raise this with the Cycling project and see if there are any other opinions. [[User:Andy Dingley|Andy Dingley]] ([[User talk:Andy Dingley|talk]]) 17:00, 22 August 2012 (UTC)\n\n:: I've pruned it. I think much is supportable and would be justified in an article under [[BikeRadar]], [[Ingenie]] or even \"Cycling in the UK\". I'm still undecided on its relevance to Future and would appreciate comment from others. Having looked at the background in more detail, it now seems perhaps a little careless for BikeRadar to have got involved at all, but their turn-around could be explained quite reasonably as \"seeing sense\", more than any dreadful U-turn shenanigans. [[User:Andy Dingley|Andy Dingley]] ([[User talk:Andy Dingley|talk]]) 17:11, 22 August 2012 (UTC)\n\n:::I noticed that the sources are a Twitter stream and a self-published blog post. We use reliable sources both to determine facts and to establish if something is notable enough to include. IMHO, the content is not particularly incriminating of Future, nor does it appear to really be that controversial to deserve this header, but I don't see any validation that the subject is important. It seems trivial to me. [[User:Corporate Minion]] 17:31, 22 August 2012 (UTC)\n\n::::Agree. I've been editing it this afternoon, although only from a standpoint of trying to keep it within guidelines and style requirements, and then edit it to a sensible level and\/or move it to a better home at a later time. As mentioned, the Bike Radar article that we haven't got is the best place for it, although the section's total value seems to be diminishing as the hours go past, as the incident looks like a simple lack of communication cock-up. I think in a month's time, even the edited version will seem to be a bit too long and suffering from a tad of UNDUE. I've knocked the separate section heading on the head as I think that was adding to UNDUE - [[User:X201|X201]] ([[User talk:X201|talk]]) 17:55, 22 August 2012 (UTC)\n:::::Merits a rap on the knuckles for some subeditor, but no lasting effect.  If there were no such thing as Twitter, the righteous indignation of a few people would have died off in the duration of a cup of coffee: now that there is such a forum to be angry on it might last 4 days.

He was born in [[Shotts]], [[Lanarkshire]].\n\nWhen he was three, his family moved to Sheffield. He was educated in [[Sheffield]] at [[King Edward VII School (Sheffield)|King Edward VII School]] where he was Head Prefect in 1951 ([http:\/\/oldedwardians.org.uk\/nlc\/prefects49-50.html photo]), before going up to [[New College, Oxford]], with an Open Scholarship in Classics.\n\nHe joined [[BBC Radio]] on graduating in 1955 from the [[University of Oxford]]. He worked there, as a producer of programmes on poetry, notably for the [[BBC Third Programme]], until 1976.  He was a member of [[The Group (literature)|The Group]].\n\nHe resigned from the BBC to take up novel writing; he introduced a series of thrillers involving the spy, Cadbury.  In his later post-BBC years, after divorcing his first wife, he married the novelist [[Lisa St Aubin de Ter\u00e1n]], by whom he had a child, Alexander Morton George MacBeth. After a divorce, he moved with his new wife, Penny, to Ireland to live at Moyne Park, Abbeyknockmoy, near Tuam in County Galway. A few months later, George MacBeth was diagnosed as suffering from motor neurone disease, of which he died in early 1992. In the last poetry he wrote, MacBeth provides an anatomy of a cruel disease and the destruction it caused two people deeply in love. Penny and George had two children, Diana (\"Lally\") Francesca Ronchetti MacBeth and George Edward Morton Mann MacBeth.\n\n''Poems from Oby'' (1982) was a Choice of the Poetry Book Society; [[Ashby with Oby|Oby]] is a [[Norfolk]] village.

Over 12,000 young people voted in the last election (March 2011), which are held in the five constituencies of Bradford (Shipley, Bradford West, Bradford South, Bradford East, and Keighley).<ref>{{cite web|title=Find Your Constituency|url=http:\/\/www.bkyp.com\/constituencies\/find-your-constituency.php|accessdate=16 August 2011}}<\/ref>\n\n== Composition ==\n===Membership===\nA Member of Youth Parliament (MYP) represents the views and needs of all young people in their constituency to government, service providers and decision makers locally, regionally and nationally. There are currently 30 Members of BKYP (MYPs).\n\nThree MYPs from the BKYP are also selected to sit on the [[United Kingdom Youth Parliament]].\n\n===Elections===\nThe BKYP elections every two years, with all young people between the ages of 11-18 being entitled to vote.  Young people elect their local area's Member(s) of Youth Parliament (MYPs), who provide a voice for the young people in their area. Each constituency has 6 MYPS, with a total of 30 across the Bradford district.\n\nAt the last election in March 2011 over 12,000 votes were cast, with young people being able to vote in polling stations in school and youth clubs, or online.\n\n==Meetings==\nThe BKYP meets regularly (normally weekly) both with their other constituency MYPS, and the youth parliament as a whole. At these meetings MYPs discuss issues and prepare future campaigns. \n\nAs well as this, there are also several meetings each year in Bradford City Hall. Young people are encouraged to come to these meetings to question their MYPs and find out about their work.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[UK Youth Parliament]]\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Footnotes on how to create references using <ref><\/ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http:\/\/www.bkyp.com\/ BKYP.com]\n\n<!--- Categories --->\n\n\n\n[[Category:Articles created via the Article Wizard]]\n[[Category:Political organisations in England]]\n[[Category:Organisations based in West Yorkshire]]","timestamp":"20160410101713","user-timestamp":"20150410101713"},{"title":"User:ClueBot III\/Detailed Indices\/User talk:Hipocrite\/01\/2016","content":"<noinclude><!-- CB3 MD5:10556c065753ca6d08fddec109189ff6 -->\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

Any kind of project can have a physical paper leaflet designed - for free - as a tool to help recruit new contributors. These leaflets will be printed at Wikimania 2014, and the designs can be re-used in the future at other events and locations.\n\nThis is particularly aimed at highlighting less discoverable but successful projects, e.g:\n\n\u2022 Active Wikiprojects: Wikiproject Medicine, WikiProject Video Games, Wikiproject Film\n\n\u2022 Tech projects\/Tools, which may be looking for either users or developers.\n\n\u2022 Less known major projects: Wikinews, Wikidata, Wikivoyage, etc.\n\n\u2022 Wiki Loves Parliaments, Wiki Loves Monuments, Wiki Loves ____\n\n\u2022 Wikimedia thematic organisations, Wikiwomen\u2019s Collaborative, The Signpost\n<br><br>\nThe deadline for submissions is 1st July 2014\n<br><br>\nFor more information or to sign up for one for your project, go to: \n<br><br>\n''[http:\/\/wikimania2014.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Project_Leaflets Project leaflets]''\n<br>\n[[User:Adikhajuria|Adikhajuria]] ([[User talk:Adikhajuria|talk]]) 10:31, 26 June 2014 (UTC)\n\n== Comment on the WikiProject X proposal ==\n\nHello there! As you may already know, most WikiProjects here on Wikipedia struggle to stay active after they've been founded.

WikiProject X will study what makes WikiProjects succeed in retaining editors and then design a prototype WikiProject system that will recruit contributors to WikiProjects and help them run effectively. Please '''[[meta:Grants:IEG\/WikiProject X|review the proposal here]]''' and leave feedback. If you have any questions, you can ask on the proposal page or leave a message on my [[User talk:Harej|talk page]]. Thank you for your time! <small>(Also, sorry about the posting mistake earlier.

My sister is an actress and edits her own imdb account, so I assumed everyone did the same. I.e. I thought the ''actual'' Enver Gjokaj would have put his birthday in there.  But now I realize that must not be the case for everybody.\nC. Yes, it was the California Birth Index...indirectly. It was the CA birth index from a random geneological website I had never heard of, and considering how long imdb has been around I thought it was more reliable.\n\nRegardless, mea culpa on the mistake.

I don't know much about templates as they are applied to musicians and don't use them enough to have a qualified opinion about whether these are useful or not.

If you think the templates are useful, the place to present your evidence and to make your case is at TfD.  That page is frequented by folks who are much more expert about the proper uses of templates in Wikipedia.  \n\nStick to the facts, don't take anything personally and you'll probably get some good feedback.

Since we disagree, we consult the template guidelines, which side with me.  There, that's solved.  Regarding the former member listing in the article - I'm less concerned about that, and I can't even remember how they are currently listed, but I think you should reconsider your system of listing by date of departure.  As you yourself point out, that puts El Duce smack in the middle of listings, which you sought to compensate for by sticking him at the beginning of the article.  But what's the point of a system that has to be compensated for by being broken for \"important members\"?  And who decides who is \"important\" anyway?  Personally, I'm against it, and I haven't seen any other editors using this system.

However, the italic title template ignores brackets because brackets are generally disambiguation that should be ignored. In these cases, you need to add <nowiki>{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Name of article here''}}<\/nowiki> below the infobox. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that you don't move article to make the title in italics, you use the italic title template or DISPLAYTITLE (which is what I've done for the ''[[Westing (By Musket and Sextant)]]'' article).

This stems from [[Rudolf Clausius]]' 1862 assertion that any [[thermodynamic process]] always \"admits to being reduced to the alteration in some way or another of the ''arrangement'' of the constituent parts of the [[working body]]\" and that internal work associated with these alterations is quantified energetically by a measure of \"entropy\" change, according to the following differential expression:<ref>''Mechanical Theory of Heat'' \u2013 Nine Memoirs on the development of concept of \"Entropy\" by Rudolf Clausius [1850&ndash;1865]<\/ref>\n\n:<math>\\int \\frac{\\delta Q}{T} \\ge 0<\/math> where Q = ... and T = ...\n\nIn the years to follow, [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] translated these \"alterations\" into that of a probabilistic view of order and disorder in gas phase molecular systems.\n\nIn recent years, in chemistry textbooks there has been a shift away from using the terms \"order\" and \"disorder\" to that of the concept of [[Entropy (energy dispersal)|energy dispersion]] to describe entropy, among other theories. In the 2002 encyclopedia [[Encarta]], for example, ''entropy'' is defined as a thermodynamic property which serves as a measure of how close a system is to equilibrium, as well as a measure of the disorder in the system.\n<ref name=Encarta>Microsoft  Encarta  2006. \u00a9 1993&ndash;2005 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.<\/ref>   \nIn the context of entropy, \"''perfect internal disorder''\" is synonymous with \"equilibrium\", but since that definition is so far different from the usual definition implied in normal speech, the use of the term in science has caused a great deal of confusion and misunderstanding.\n\nLocally, the entropy can be lowered by external action. This applies to machines, such as a refrigerator, where the entropy in the cold chamber is being reduced, and to living organisms. This local decrease in entropy is, however, only possible at the expense of an entropy increase in the surroundings.\n\n==History==\nThis \"molecular ordering\" entropy perspective traces its origins to molecular movement interpretations developed by [[Rudolf Clausius]] in the 1850s, particularly with his 1862 visual conception of molecular [[disgregation]].  Similarly, in 1859, after reading a paper on the diffusion of molecules by Clausius, Scottish physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] formulated the [[Maxwell distribution]] of molecular velocities, which gave the proportion of molecules having a certain velocity in a specific range.  This was the first-ever statistical law in physics.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mahon, Basil |title=The Man Who Changed Everything \u2013 the Life of James Clerk Maxwell|location=Hoboken, NJ | publisher=Wiley|year=2003|isbn=0-470-86171-1}}<\/ref>\n\nIn 1864, [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], a young student in Vienna, came across Maxwell\u2019s paper and was so inspired by it that he spent much of his long and distinguished life developing the subject further.  Later, Boltzmann, in efforts to develop a [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] for the behavior of a gas, applied the laws of [[probability]] to Maxwell's and Clausius' molecular interpretation of entropy so to begin to interpret entropy in terms of order and disorder.  Similarly, in 1882 [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] used the word \"Unordnung\" (disorder) to describe entropy.<ref>{{cite book| last = Anderson | first = Greg |title= Thermodynamics of Natural Systems | publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=0-521-84772-9}}<\/ref>\n\n==Overview==\nTo highlight the fact that order and disorder are commonly understood to be measured in terms of entropy, below are current science encyclopedia and science dictionary definitions of entropy:\n\n*A measure of the unavailability of a system\u2019s energy to do work; also a measure of disorder; the higher the entropy the greater the disorder.<ref>''Oxford Dictionary of Science'', 2005<\/ref>\n*A measure of disorder; the higher the entropy the greater the disorder.<ref>''Oxford Dictionary of Chemistry'', 2004<\/ref>\n*In thermodynamics, a parameter representing the state of disorder of a system at the atomic, ionic, or molecular level; the greater the disorder the higher the entropy.<ref>Barnes & Noble's ''Essential Dictionary of Science'', 2004<\/ref>\n*A measure of disorder in the universe or of the availability of the energy in a system to do work.<ref>Gribbin's ''Encyclopedia of Particle Physics'', 2000<\/ref>\n\nEntropy and disorder also have associations with [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]].<ref name=\"Landsberg-A\" >Landsberg, P.T.

Similarly, in a gas, the '''order''' is perfect and the measure of entropy of the system has its lowest value when all the molecules are in one place, whereas when more points are occupied the gas is all the more disorderly and the measure of the entropy of the system has its largest value.<ref name=\"Greven\" \/>\n\nIn [[systems ecology]], as another example, the entropy of a collection of items comprising a system is defined as a measure of their disorder or equivalently the relative likelihood of the instantaneous configuration of the items.<ref name=\"Ulanowicz\" >{{cite book | last = Ulanowicz | first = Robert, E. | title = Growth and Development \u2013 Ecosystems Phenomenology | publisher = toExcel Press | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-595-00145-9}}<\/ref>  Moreover, according to theoretical ecologist and chemical engineer [[Robert Ulanowicz]], \u201cthat entropy might provide a quantification of the heretofore subjective notion of disorder has spawned innumerable scientific and philosophical narratives.\u201d<ref name=\"Ulanowicz\" \/><ref>{{cite book | last = Kubat | first = L. |author2=Zeman, J. | title = Entropy and Information in Science and Philosophy| publisher = Elsevier | year = 1975}}<\/ref>  In particular, many biologists have taken to speaking in terms of the entropy of an organism, or about its antonym [[negentropy]], as a measure of the structural order within an organism.<ref name=\"Ulanowicz\" \/>\n\nThe mathematical basis with respect to the association entropy has with order and disorder began, essentially, with the famous [[Boltzmann formula]], <math>S = k_\\mathrm{B} \\ln W \\! <\/math>, which relates entropy ''S'' to the number of possible states ''W'' in which a system can be found.<ref name=\"Jorgensen\" >{{cite book | last1 = Jorgensen | first1 = Sven, J. | last2 = Svirezhev|first2= Yuri M | title = Towards a Thermodynamic Theory for Ecological Systems | publisher = Elsevier | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-08-044167-X}}<\/ref>  As an example, consider a box that is divided into two sections.  What is the probability that a certain number, or all of the particles, will be found in one section versus the other when the particles are randomly allocated to different places within the box?  If you only have one particle, then that system of one particle can subsist in two states, one side of the box versus the other.  If you have more than one particle, or define states as being further locational subdivisions of the box, the entropy is lower because the number of states is greater. The relationship between entropy, order, and disorder in the Boltzmann equation is so clear among physicists that according to the views of thermodynamic ecologists Sven Jorgensen and Yuri Svirezhev, \u201cit is obvious that entropy is a measure of order or, most likely, disorder in the system.\u201d<ref name=\"Jorgensen\" \/>  In this direction, the second law of thermodynamics, as famously enunciated by [[Rudolf Clausius]] in 1865, states that:\n\n<div style=\"font-size:125%\">\n{{cquote|The entropy of the universe tends to a maximum.}}\n<\/div>\n\nThus, if entropy is associated with disorder and if the entropy of the universe is headed towards maximal entropy, then many are often puzzled as to the nature of the \"ordering\" process and operation of [[evolution]] in relation to Clausius' most famous version of the second law, which states that the universe is headed towards maximal \u201cdisorder\u201d.  In the recent 2003 book ''SYNC \u2013 the Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order'' by [[Steven Strogatz]], for example, we find \u201cScientists have often been baffled by the existence of spontaneous order in the universe.  The [[laws of thermodynamics]] seem to dictate the opposite, that nature should inexorably degenerate toward a state of greater disorder, greater entropy.  Yet all around us we see magnificent structures\u2014galaxies, cells, ecosystems, human beings\u2014that have all somehow managed to assemble themselves.\u201d <ref>{{cite book | last = Strogatz | first = Steven | title = the Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order | publisher = Theia | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-7868-6844-9}}<\/ref>\n\nThe common argument used to explain this is that, locally, entropy can be lowered by external action, e.g. solar heating action, and that this applies to machines, such as a refrigerator, where the entropy in the cold chamber is being reduced, to growing crystals, and to living organisms.<ref name=\"Encarta\" \/>  This local increase in order is, however, only possible at the expense of an entropy increase in the surroundings; here more disorder must be created.<ref name=\"Encarta\" \/><ref name=\"Brooks\" >{{cite book | last = Brooks | first = Daniel, R. |author2=Wiley, E.O. | title = Entropy as Evolution \u2013 Towards a Unified Theory of Biology | publisher = University of Chicago Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-226-07574-5}}<\/ref>  The conditioner of this statement suffices that living systems are [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]]s in which both [[heat]], [[mass]], and or [[Mechanical work|work]] may transfer into or out of the system.  Unlike temperature, the putative entropy of a living system would drastically change if the organism were thermodynamically isolated.  If an organism was in this type of \u201cisolated\u201d situation, its entropy would increase markedly as the once-living components of the organism decayed to an unrecognizable mass.<ref name=\"Ulanowicz\" \/>\n\n==Phase change==\nOwing to these early developments, the typical example of entropy change \u0394''S'' is that associated with phase change.  In solids, for example, which are typically ordered on the molecular scale, usually have smaller entropy than liquids, and liquids have smaller entropy than gases and colder gases have smaller entropy than hotter gases.  Moreover, according to the [[third law of thermodynamics]], at [[absolute zero]] temperature, crystalline structures are approximated to have perfect \"order\" and zero entropy.  This correlation occurs because the numbers of different microscopic quantum energy states available to an ordered system are usually much smaller than the number of states available to a system that appears to be disordered.\n\nFrom his famous 1896 ''Lectures on Gas Theory'', Boltzmann diagrams the structure of a solid body, as shown above, by postulating that each [[molecule]] in the body has a \"rest position\".  According to Boltzmann, if it approaches a neighbor molecule it is repelled by it, but if it moves farther away there is an attraction.  This, of course was a revolutionary perspective in its time; many, during these years, did not believe in the existence of either atoms or molecules (see: [[history of the molecule]]).<ref>{{cite book | last = Cercignani | first = Carlo | author-link = Carlo Cercignani | title = Ludwig Boltzmann: The Man Who Trusted Atoms | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780198501541}}<\/ref>  According to these early views, and others such as those developed by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]], if energy in the form of [[heat]] is added to a solid, so to make it into a liquid or a gas, a common depiction is that the ordering of the atoms and molecules becomes more random and chaotic with an increase in temperature:\n[[Image:Solid-liquid-gas.svg|600px|center]]\nThus, according to Boltzmann, owing to increases in thermal motion, whenever heat is added to a working substance, the rest position of molecules will be pushed apart, the body will expand, and this will create more ''molar-disordered'' distributions and arrangements of molecules.  These disordered arrangements, subsequently, correlate, via probability arguments, to an increase in the measure of entropy.<ref>{{cite book | last = Boltzmann | first = Ludwig | title = Lectures on Gas Theory | publisher = Dover (reprint) | year = 1896 | isbn = 0-486-68455-5}}<\/ref>\n\n==Adiabatic demagnetization==\nIn the quest for ultra-cold temperatures, a temperature lowering technique called [[adiabatic demagnetization]] is used, where atomic entropy considerations are utilized which can be described in order-disorder terms.<ref name=\"Halliday\" >{{cite book | last = Halliday | first = David |author2=Resnick, Robert | title = Fundamentals of Physics, Extended 3rd ed. | publisher = Wiley | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-471-81995-6}}<\/ref>  In this process, a sample of solid such as chrome-alum salt, whose molecules are equivalent to tiny magnets, is inside an insulated enclosure cooled to a low temperature, typically 2 or 4 kelvins, with a strong [[magnetic field]] being applied to the container using a powerful external magnet, so that the tiny molecular magnets are aligned forming a well-ordered \"initial\" state at that low temperature. This magnetic alignment means that the magnetic energy of each molecule is minimal.<ref name=nasa>[http:\/\/imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov\/docs\/teachers\/lessons\/xray_spectra\/background-adr.html NASA - How does an Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator Work ?]<\/ref> The external magnetic field is then reduced, a removal that is considered to be closely [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]]. Following this reduction, the atomic magnets then assume random less-ordered orientations, owing to thermal agitations, in the \"final\" state:\n\n[[Image:Adiabatic-demagnitization.svg|275px|center|thumb|Entropy \"order\"\/\"disorder\" considerations in the process of [[adiabatic demagnetization]]]]\n\nThe \"disorder\" and hence the entropy associated with the change in the atomic alignments has clearly increased.<ref name=\"Halliday\" \/> In terms of energy flow, the movement from a magnetically aligned state requires energy from the thermal motion of the molecules, converting thermal energy into magnetic energy.<ref name=nasa\/> Yet, according to the [[second law of thermodynamics]], because no [[heat]] can enter or leave the container, due to its adiabatic insulation, the system should exhibit no change in entropy, i.e. \u0394''S'' = 0.  The increase in disorder, however, associated with the randomizing directions of the atomic magnets represents an entropy ''increase''?  To compensate for this, the disorder (entropy) associated with the [[temperature]] of the specimen must ''decrease'' by the same amount.<ref name=\"Halliday\" \/>  The temperature thus falls as a result of this process of thermal energy being converted into magnetic energy. If the magnetic field is then increased, the temperature rises and the magnetic salt has to be cooled again using a cold material such as liquid helium.<ref name=nasa\/>\n\n== Difficulties with the term \"disorder\" ==\n\nIn recent years the long-standing use of term \"disorder\" to discuss entropy has met with some criticism.<ref name=crutch>Frank L.

Many popular chemistry textbooks in recent editions increasingly have tended to instead present entropy through the idea of degrees of freedom and [[Entropy (energy dispersal)|energy dispersal]], which is a dominant contribution to entropy in most everyday situations.\nThe textbook examples of a messy (disordered) and tidy (ordered) bedroom for describing entropy do not provide particularly good analogies, because (being a textbook) they're both still images, meaning there are no degrees of freedom.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Entropy]]\n*[[History of entropy]]\n*[[Entropy of mixing]]\n*[[Entropy (information theory)]]\n*[[Entropy (computing)]]\n*[[Entropy (energy dispersal)]]\n*[[Second law of thermodynamics]]\n*[[Entropy (statistical thermodynamics)]]\n*[[Entropy (classical thermodynamics)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Lambert, F.L.
