[[User:Fd2006|Fd2006]] ([[User talk:Fd2006|talk]]) 09:18, 5 August 2008 (UTC)\n\n== LUHG Campaign  ==\n\nShould we add a section for the LUHG campaign against the Glazers? [[User:Conay|Conay]] ([[User talk:Conay|talk]]) 21:01, 4 March 2010 (UTC)\n:I agree with this. There doesn't seem to be much note on the scarves protest or the visible backing of certain personalities. [[User:Paralympiakos|Paralympiakos]] ([[User talk:Paralympiakos|talk]]) 23:59, 12 March 2010 (UTC)\n::I'm in the process of expanding this article. Give me a few days and I'll get everything sorted. \u2013 [[User:PeeJay2K3|Pee]][[User talk:PeeJay2K3|Jay]] 00:47, 13 March 2010 (UTC)\n:::This section is inaccurate and incomplete to say the least. May I suggest that it be removed, or edited to contain 'facts', and not rumour. Furthermore, the content placement within this Wiki page is also incorrect, meaning it ought to be placed within the \"Aftermath\" section, or a section of it's own, and not within the section on the \"Red Knights\", because the timeline of the RedKnights is some five years after the start of LUHG.[[User:Redmoggy|Redmoggy]] ([[User talk:Redmoggy|talk]]) 17:28, 27 August 2012 (UTC)\n::::I disagree. A lot of people view the Red Knights as a result of the LUHG campaign and very much part of it. The issue of fan ownership is at the heart of both LUHG and the Red Knights, and they naturally follow on from each other; it doesn't matter if the Red Knights only came to the fore in 2010, the topics are still related. Also, what are you actually alluding to when you talk about 'rumours' in the section? \u2013 [[User:PeeJay2K3|Pee]][[User talk:PeeJay2K3|Jay]] 18:50, 27 August 2012 (UTC)\n:::::Okay, I see what you mean by people perceiving the emergence of the RK's to the public domain because of LUHG. There are many rumours about the origins of LUHG, what has been written on the wiki page is an example of one of those rumours, perhaps referring to the LUHG website may help? Furthermore, another correction is perhaps required, it was the raising of capital via Bonds that sparked the protests of 2010. It was on Saturday 16th January 2010 that the protests began that year, after a supporter meeting that was held at O'Briens in Stretford, a group of supporters made plans to unfurl a LUHG banner around the 70th minute mark, which they did and resulted in a temporary confiscation by club security CES, this then set the tone for the next home game on the 23rd January against Hull, and branched protests at the Carrington training complex, and at Reserve games.  Hope this helps is some way.[[User:Redmoggy|Redmoggy]] ([[User talk:Redmoggy|talk]]) 02:41, 28 August 2012 (UTC)\n\n==Change name==\n\nWhy isn't this article named \"Ownership of Manchester United\"?

[[User:Tomlock01|Tomlock01]] ([[User talk:Tomlock01|talk]]) 18:36, 22 June 2010 (UTC)\n:::How about [[Glazer ownership of Manchester United]]? Since they own the parent company, which is \"Manchester United Ltd\", my earlier suggestion of [[Malcolm Glazer ownership of Manchester United F.C.]] would be incorrect (although redirects should exist from titles including the \"F.C.\" part). So I guess it's either [[Glazer ownership of Manchester United]] or [[Glazer family ownership of Manchester United]], yes? \u2013 [[User:PeeJay2K3|Pee]][[User talk:PeeJay2K3|Jay]] 20:08, 22 June 2010 (UTC)\n::::Yes, but I don't mind which since they are both accurate.

[[User:Tomlock01|Tomlock01]] ([[User talk:Tomlock01|talk]]) 20:53, 22 June 2010 (UTC)\n:::::I'll try my best to get the Ownership article finished, and then I would be happy for you to look it over.

All I see is negative in every sentence and it's quite unnecessary in my opinion. I think a section where it shows how much money the Glazer have spent to bring in players and trophies that have been won should be added and in turn make the article less on sided. [[User:Lafuzion|La Fuzion]] ([[User talk:Lafuzion|talk]]) 14:34, 6 October 2010 (UTC)\n:Would you care to tell me exactly how much of the Glazers' own money they have actually put into Manchester United? Or better yet, can you find a source in the media? The fact is that Manchester United's activity in the transfer market has been mostly paid for out of revenues made in spite of the Glazers, not because of them. In fact, were it not for the massive interest payments, United would probably be even more active in the transfer market than they currently are. Remember a couple of years ago when United were offered David Villa by Valencia? We could have got him if we didn't have \u00a3500 million of debt. Probably could have kept Tevez too. So sure, you can say the article isn't neutral, or you can say that it accurately reflects the state the Glazers have put Manchester United in. \u2013 [[User:PeeJay2K3|Pee]][[User talk:PeeJay2K3|Jay]] 15:57, 17 July 2011 (UTC)","timestamp":"20160410102544","user-timestamp":"20150410102544"},{"title":"User talk:189.41.133.235","content":"== June 2009 ==\n\n[[File:Information.svg|25px]] Welcome and thank you for experimenting with Wikipedia.

He first appeared in ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' Vol. 1 #5 (June 1961), which was created by [[Gardner Fox]] and [[Mike Sekowsky]].<ref name=\"dc-ency\">{{Citation | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Doctor Destiny | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 102  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}<\/ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nDoctor Destiny was once a petty criminal scientist who used his [[genius]] to create astounding devices for crime. He first encountered the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] shortly after he invented an [[anti-gravity]] device and will-deadener beam that allowed him to capture [[Green Lantern#Silver Age Green Lantern|Green Lantern]] by luring him into his base using anti-gravity discs to fly over the city as Green Lantern, impersonate him, and infiltrate the JLA. Before Doctor Destiny could further his criminal ends, however, the Leaguers discovered his treachery as Green Arrow had heard a member had been captured and was being impersonated from an underworld informant. The League was captured by his Will-Deadening beam, that also had [[Kryptonite]] as an element. Destiny then revealed he planned to send his ship into space, thus getting rid of the JLA. However, when drawing the JLA upwards, the station suffered a brief power drain, lessening the effects of the will-deadener. Green Lantern was able to free himself during the drain, and promptly imprisoned Destiny and his two henchmen.\n\n===Morpheus===\nHe then created the \"Materioptikon\", a device which allowed him to create reality from the fabric of [[dream]]s.<ref>''Justice League of America'' 19 (1963)<\/ref> In a later [[retroactive continuity|retcon]] in the Sandman series written by Neil Gaiman, his mother, Ethel (the former mistress of [[List of characters in The Sandman#Roderick Burgess|Roderick Burgess]]), gave him [[Dream (comics)|Morpheus]]' Dreamstone, which powered the device. He manipulated the Dreamstone, forcing flaws and adding circuitry, until it was attuned to him and not the Dream King. Morpheus was imprisoned by [[Alex Burgess]] at the time, unaware of what Dr. Destiny was doing and unable to stop or prevent it.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"\/>\n\nDoctor Destiny's power was so great that the [[Justice League]] resorted to drastic measures to stop him. They hypnotized him and manipulated his psyche to prevent him from [[dream]]ing; this kept him from using the Materioptikon for criminal purposes but caused him to lose his mind and shrivel to a skeletal wreck of a man. He was then sent to [[Arkham Asylum]], where his sanity eroded further.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"\/>\n\nHe escaped from Arkham and captured the [[Sandman (DC Comics)#Garrett Sanford|Sandman]] (Dr. Garrett Sanford), and used his equipment to pit people's dreams against the Justice League, eventually capturing most of the current Leaguers.  Thanks to the efforts of others such as [[Zatanna]] and [[Elongated Man]], the Sandman was freed and reclaimed his equipment, aiding Doctor Destiny's recapture.<ref>''Justice League of America Annual'' #1<\/ref>\n\n===Arkham Asylum===\nAgain from The Sandman series by Neil Gaiman, when Doctor Destiny's mother died, Doctor Destiny escaped Arkham, reclaimed the Ruby, and used it to go on a rampage, driving the whole world insane. Dr.Destiny makes his way to a 24-hour diner and proceeds to torture the patrons in numerous sadistic ways (including making some of them have sexual intercouse against their will), over the span of 24 hours, before having them kill each other. [[Dream (comics)|Dream]], recently freed and searching for his stolen tokens of power, could not stop Doctor Destiny until the villain decided to leech all of Dream's power into the Ruby and destroy the gem. The destruction of the Dreamstone returned all of its power back to Dream, including power the Lord of Dreams had been without for millennia. Morpheus then returned Dr. Destiny to Arkham and returned his ability to dream (or at least sleep). Although he is able to dream once again, Doctor Destiny's sanity is still extremely shaky.\n\nDoctor Destiny later learned that continued use of the Materioptikon meant he still had some dream manipulation powers even without the Dreamstone. He warped the [[Atom (comics)#Silver Age Atom|Atom]]'s dreams of the original Justice League into a world where the [[superhero]]es were [[fascism|fascist]] bullies, as part of a plan to trap the then-current Justice League there. He was defeated when the comatose [[Blue Beetle]] was able to enter the dream world. Later, Dr. Destiny threatened the JLA once again by bringing his \"dream self\" into the real world and attacking them with bizarre and irrational dream-logic, \"haunting\" scenes of his old crimes as well as Atlantis (the ocean signifying a spiritual centre in dreams). Fortunately, before Destiny's dream-self fully realised what was happening to him, he was defeated when the League tracked down his real-world self and projected their dream selves into reality to confront Destiny; since the League were dreaming about victory, they couldn't lose, and Destiny was swiftly returned to his cell in Arkham.\n\nOver the years, Doctor Destiny has proven one of the Justice League's most persistent foes.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"\/> In his earliest appearances, before he lost his sanity, his goals were more rational: to acquire wealth and personal power, to eliminate all his enemies, and so on. All of these schemes revolved around the creative and liberal use of the Materioptikon, a strategy which often caught his opponents off-guard. One can assume that Doctor Destiny is still interested in attaining all of his former goals: the elimination of the Justice League, the restoration of his human appearance, and the reconstruction of the Materioptikon.\n\n===4th Parallel===\nDuring the 4th Parallel storyline in ''JLA Classified'', Doctor Destiny's control over the Materioptikon is usurped by Darrin Profitt the [[Red King (DC Comics)|Red King]].\n\n===Justice Society of America===\nIn the previews for future issues of ''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3), [[Thom Kallor|Starman]] mentioned \"''It's the doctor. The one with no face!''\", which would allude to future appearances by Doctor Destiny (i.e. his skeletal face). He finally appeared in ''[[Justice Society of America]]'' Vol. 3 #4, back in his old costume, with the captured [[Legion of Super-Heroes|Legionnaire]] [[Nura Nal|Dream Girl]] chained in his cell in [[Arkham Asylum]]. He uses Dream Girl's nightmares to deal with the Asylum guards. When [[Batman]], [[Sandy Hawkins|Sandman]], [[Thom Kallor|Starman]], and [[Geo-Force]] arrive at the Asylum, Starman goes up against Destiny by himself, but is subdued when Destiny uses Dream Girl's powers to create a zombified version of Kenz Nuhor, the man Starman killed. Starman begs Destiny to let Dream Girl go, and awakens her from her trance by using the \"wake-up\" word. When she awakes, Dream Girl tells Destiny that she foresaw his death, being killed in his sleep by the [[Daniel Hall|owner of the Dreamstone]] before she knocks him out.\n\n===Superman\/Batman===\nIn the [[Superman\/Batman]] storyline '\"Mash-Up\", Doctor Destiny created a dream world consisting of combinations of people from the real world, hoping to replace the waking world with his fabricated realm. Superman and Batman, who had somehow managed to escape being fused together, stopped Destiny by freeing the combined form of [[Raven (comics)|Raven]] and [[Zatanna]]. The backlash from the broken illusion put Destiny into a comatose state, mumbling the name \"Bruce Kent\" - the only combined being he was unable to create. Of note, however, he appears again capable of massive reality warping without direct control of the Materioptikon in the waking world, or at least enough magical power to fuel the creation of a new world using only dreams as his base.<ref>''Superman\/Batman'' #60-61<\/ref>\n\n===The New 52===\nIn \"[[The New 52]]\" (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), Doctor Destiny first appears at the end of ''[[Justice League Dark]]'' #19.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Jeff Lemire, Ray Fawkes|artist=Mikel Janin, Vincente Cifuentes|story=Horror City Part 1: The House of Mystery|title=Justice League Dark|volume=1|issue=19|date=June 2013|publisher=DC Comics}}<\/ref> A.R.G.U.S. is in possession of his Dream Stone, which John Constantine recognizes.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Jeff Lemire|artist=Mikel Janin|story=The Black Room|title=Justice League Dark|volume=1|issue=9|date=July 2012|publisher=DC Comics}}<\/ref> In issue 20, it is revealed that [[Madame Xanadu]] is Dr. Destiny's mother.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Ray Fawkes, Jeff Lemire|artist=Mikel Janin, Vincente Cifuentes|story=Horror City Part 2: The Nightmare Gospel|title=Justice League Dark|volume=1|issue=20|date=July 2013|publisher=DC Comics}}<\/ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Forever Evil]]\" storyline, Doctor Destiny is among the villains recruited by the [[Crime Syndicate of America]] to join the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].<ref>''Forever Evil'' #1<\/ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nDoctor Destiny has the ability to manipulate anyone's dreams.\n\nDoctor Destiny also has an extensive medical knowledge.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Batman: Arkham Asylum===\n* In [[Grant Morrison]]'s 1989 ''[[Batman]]'' [[graphic novel]], ''[[Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth]]'', Dr. Destiny is referred to by the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], and makes a short appearance later in the novel. In the annotated script for ''Arkham Asylum'', Morrison explains that he was not a fan of the popular depiction of the Doctor as a tall, musclebound man with a skull for a head. Rather he believed that Destiny's body would have \"whithered horribly\" after having been robbed of the ability to dream.<ref>Morrison, Grant, and Dave McKean. Arkham Asylum: a Serious House on Serious Earth. New York, N.Y.: DC Comics, 2004. 146. Print.<\/ref> Thus [[Dave McKean]] (the artist) portrays him as being atrophied and feeble, restricted to a wheelchair, but still wielding a latent amount of power which could not be ignored (though he was mentioned as needing eye contact with a victim to disable them). He is however defeated quite easily by Batman, who kicks the villain's wheelchair down a set of steps before he has a chance to display his powers.<ref>Morrison, Grant, and Dave McKean. Arkham Asylum. Lonson: Titan, 1989. Print.<\/ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n[[Image:Dr Destiny Justice League.jpg|right|thumb|Dr. Destiny as he appeared in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode \"Only a Dream\"]]\n* In the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode \"Only a Dream\", John Dee (voiced by [[William Atherton]]) was a low-level [[LexCorp]] employee and small-time crook who was incarcerated in Stryker's Prison for guarding a supply of smuggled weapons. He volunteered to be a [[Guinea pig#Scientific research|guinea pig]] for a doctor's experiments with the Materioptikon, a machine that gave people [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]] abilities. Between sessions, he dreamt of single-handedly defeating the [[Justice League]] and being a member of the [[Injustice Gang]] when [[Lex Luthor]] and [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] arrive to recruit him. When he found out that his parole request didn't go through, John was saddened. His wife Penny left him soon after for another man, exacerbating the situation. John found an opportunity to abuse the Materioptikon during a prison riot, exposing himself to an intensified burst from the machine. The experience gave him even greater [[telepathy]]. With this, he set off to wreak havoc on people through their dreams. Dee's first act of supervillainy was using his abilities to mentally torture Penny in retribution for turning her back on him. In her dream, he manipulated his appearance to match his standard comic book costume and, deciding that his name was too ordinary, took the new name \"Doctor Destiny\". As a result of his telepathic torture, Penny died from traumatic shock. Dr. Destiny later trapped [[Superman]], [[Hawkgirl]], [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern]], and the [[Wally West|Flash]] in their dreams, playing out their worst fears: Hawkgirl (who was [[claustrophobia|claustrophobic]], as revealed in an earlier battle with [[Luminus (comics)|Luminus]]) was trapped in a coffin and buried alive, Flash was trapped inside a world where he moved so fast that the world around him was virtually motionless, Superman's powers increased beyond his ability to control them and he accidentally caused massive destruction and killed all those he loved, and Green Lantern (who feared his membership in the [[Green Lantern Corps]] had cut him off him from his life on Earth) found himself trapped in a world in which he was now truly alienated from his friends and family. [[Martian Manhunter|J'onn J'onzz]] telepathically entered his teammates' dreams to make them realize that what they were experiencing was not real, while [[Batman]] eventually tracked down Doctor Destiny (keeping his mind free of Destiny's influence by humming ''[[Fr\u00e8re Jacques]]''). Attempting to stab Batman with a syringe filled with a powerful [[sedative]], Dee inadvertently stabbed and injected himself. Destiny was last seen back at Stryker's in a [[catatonia|catatonic]] state humming ''Frere Jacques'' over and over again.\n* Doctor Destiny appears in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode \"I Am Legion\", having apparently recovered from his condition as well as gaining the ability to resume his nightmare form even in reality. He appears as a member of [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. He was very briefly seen with [[Lex Luthor|Luthor]]'s team of supervillains in \"Alive!\".\n* In Season 3 of ''[[Smallville]]'' episode \"Slumber\", Clark connected with a girl named Sara Conroy in their dreams while she was in a coma, helping her to confront a monster called \"The Traveler\" that served as a manifestation of Sara Conroy's fear of her uncle Nicholas, who was keeping her unconscious to allow him to gain control of money she had gained in an inheritance from her deceased parents. This manifestation was very similar to Doctor Destiny except for his red torn cape and his face was never seen.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n* Doctor Destiny has appeared in the ''Justice League Unlimited'' spin-off comic book. His appearances are in issues #25, where [[Klarion the Witch Boy]] summons him alongside [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]], Dala, [[Hugo Strange]]'s Monster Men, [[Man-Bat]], [[Professor Milo]]'s werewolves, and [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] to help fight [[Batman]] and [[Zatanna]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http:\/\/jl.toonzone.net\/destiny\/destiny.htm Toonzone: Doctor Destiny]\n* [http:\/\/www.dcuguide.com\/chronology.php?name=doctordestiny DCU Guide: Doctor Destiny chronology]\n\n{{Justice League}}\n{{Justice League Dark}}\n{{The Sandman}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Gardner Fox]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Mike Sekowsky]]\n[[Category:DC Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional rapists]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1961]]\n[[Category:DC Comics telepaths]]\n[[Category:DC Comics fantasy characters]]","timestamp":"20160410102548","user-timestamp":"20150410102548"},{"title":"User talk:200.220.202.2","content":"==Regarding edits made during [[December 16]] [[2006]]==\nPlease do not add nonsense to Wikipedia{{#if:{{{1|}}}|, as you did to [[:{{{1}}}]]}}.

The mountains of [[Edom]], and the town of [[Zoara|Zoar]] (Sughar) at the southeastern end of the [[Dead Sea]] were included in the district. However, the [[Galilee]] was excluded, being part of [[Jund al-Urdunn]] in the north.<ref name=\"le Strange\"\/>\n\nAfter the [[Fatimid]]s conquered the district from the Abbasids, [[Jerusalem]] eventually became the capital, and the principal towns were [[Ashkelon]], Ramla, Gaza, [[Arsuf]], Caesarea, Jaffa, [[Jericho]], Nablus, Bayt Jibrin, and [[Amman]].<ref name=\"le Strange\">le Strange, 1890, [https:\/\/archive.org\/stream\/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page\/25\/mode\/1up p.25]-[https:\/\/archive.org\/stream\/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page\/30\/mode\/1up p.30].<\/ref> The district persisted in some form until the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] invasions and the [[Crusades]] of the late 11th century.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Palaestina Prima]]\n*[[Syria Palaestina]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book | title = Palestine Under the Moslems: A Description of Syria and the Holy Land from A.D. 650 to 1500 | url = https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/palestineundermo00lestuoft | first1 = Guy | last1 = Le Strange | authorlink = Guy Le Strange | publisher = Committee of the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]] | location = London | year = 1890 | oclc = 1004386}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http:\/\/www.mideastweb.org\/palcaliph1.htm Mideastweb Map of \"Palestine Under the Caliphs\", showing Jund boundaries]\n\n{{Districts of Islamic Syria}}\n\n[[Category:Subdivisions of the Abbasid Caliphate]]\n[[Category:History of Palestine (region)]]\n[[Category:History of Israel]]\n[[Category:Military history of the Umayyad Caliphate]]\n[[Category:7th century in Asia]]\n[[Category:8th century in Asia]]\n[[Category:9th century in Asia]]\n[[Category:10th century in Asia]]\n[[Category:11th century in Asia]]\n[[Category:7th-century establishments in the Umayyad Caliphate]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in the 7th century]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in the 11th century]]\n[[Category:11th-century disestablishments in Asia]]","timestamp":"20160410102613","user-timestamp":"20150410102613"},{"title":"1966 24 Hours of Le Mans","content":"{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}\n\n{{Le Mans Races\n| Previous = 1965\n| Current = 1966\n| Next = 1967\n}}\n\nThe '''1966 [[24 Hours of Le Mans]]''' was the 34th Grand Prix of Endurance, and took place on 18 and 19 June 1966.<ref>''Motor Sport'', July 1966, Pages 596-597.<\/ref> It was also the seventh round of the [[1966 World Sportscar Championship season]]. It was the first time that [[Henri Pescarolo]] entered the race, a driver who went on to set the record for the most starts.\n\n[[File:Circuit de La Sarthe Le Mans 1932-1967.png|thumb|300px|Le Mans in 1966]]\n\n==Pre-race==\nIn 1966, the [[Ford GT40|Ford GT40 Mk. II]] had become reliable. Shelby test driver [[Ken Miles]] managed to win at the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] and the [[12 Hours of Sebring]] with the big block Ford. Ford sent no less than eight Mark IIs to La Sarthe, entered by three teams: Shelby, [[Holman Moody|Holman & Moody]] and [[Alan Mann Racing]].\n\n[[Ferrari]] sent only two works P3s to compete against the Ford armada. Another P3 was entered by [[North American Racing Team|NART]], and four 365 P2 were entered by Ferrari's usual private partners.\n\n==Race==\nThe two works P3s were involved in an accident. At 01:45 the P2s had already exhausted their engine in trying to keep contact with the Mk. II and the last Ferrari prototype, the [[Pedro Rodr\u00edguez (racing driver)|Pedro Rodr\u00edguez]]\/[[Richie Ginther]] NART P3 retired with overheating. The race was won for Ford. For the first time in history an [[United States|American]] car had won Le Mans.<ref>http:\/\/www.supercars.net\/cars\/692.html<\/ref>\n\nAt the last pit stop, three Mark IIs were in front. [[Ken Miles]] and [[Denny Hulme]] were leading, followed by [[Bruce McLaren]] and [[Chris Amon]] in the same lap. [[Ronnie Bucknum]] and [[Dick Hutcherson]] were third, but twelve laps behind.\n\nAt the finish, Ford decided to stage publicity photo between Miles\/Hulme and McLaren\/Amon with the No. 5 following, too. According to witnesses, McLaren left a small margin to Miles and it was expected than Miles\/Hulme will be declared winner after the examination of the photo finish. But the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest|ACO]] declared the McLaren\/Amon car had won the race, having covered more distance in 24 hours, as it had started the race several places behind the Miles\/Hulme car. The ACO estimated the difference to 8 meters. This was a terrible disappointment for Ken Miles, who expected the triple crown Daytona-Sebring-Le Mans as a reward for his investment in the GT40 development. The finish remains the closest in Le Mans history.\n\n==Official results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n! Pos\n! Class\n! No\n! Team\n! Drivers\n! Chassis\n! Engine\n!

As Illinois' students we were curious as to who the other numbers belonged to and we did a bit of research and unfortunately didn't find much.  In fact, we couldn't even find evidence supporting anyone's number being retired on any university website; however, a few messageboard posts and the Wikipedia article on a funny guy both pointed towards Grange and Butkus having the only two retired numbers in Illini history.  Consequently, we decided to edit the Red Grange article and change it to state that his number is one of only two to be retired throughout Illini history.  We'd appreciate it if anyone else could shed some light on this issue. <small><span class=\"autosigned\">\u2014Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:74.136.197.127|74.136.197.127]] ([[User talk:74.136.197.127|talk]] \u2022 [[Special:Contributions\/74.136.197.127|contribs]]) <\/span><\/small><!-- Template:Unsigned -->\n\n== That Berman Story ==\nThat Berman story is so hackneyed.

Even the New York Post won't sink to such censorship on the subject!  So much for being bold on Wikipedia!

That section of Giuliani's biography does not need to stop in its tracks to include mini-bio's of Koeppel or Hsiao (if they are notable, create new articles for them), nor does it need to discuss Giuliani's grooming habits (never discussed anywhere else in the article), nor does it need a flash-forward to a wedding many years later.  However, I ''have'' included his non-attendance at the wedding in [[Political positions of Rudy Giuliani\u200e#LGBT issues]], where it has some marginal relevance to his position on same-sex marriage.  [[User:Wasted Time R|Wasted Time R]] ([[User talk:Wasted Time R|talk]]) 17:25, 3 May 2009 (UTC)\n\n:The section is WAY TOO VAGUE simply saying \"gay friends.\"  I put specific names and occupations (it is interesting that he would be staying at a car dealer!).  The comments about what kind of roommate he was was done in an affectionate manner showing a domesticity that he was comfortable with.  Burying the fact he did not attend the wedding in the \"issues\" section is definitely a way of hiding it.  The area of interest on these articles are always the personal side not the issues. [[User:Americasroof|Americasroof]] ([[User talk:Americasroof|talk]]) 01:36, 4 May 2009 (UTC)\n\n::'Gay friends' is succinct and descriptive.  This is a relatively minor episode in Giuliani's story.  The main article is a fairly quick once-over of Giuliani's life.  If you look at [[Mayoralty of Rudy Giuliani]], you'll see a number of important policy issues and Giuliani governing characteristics that have been relegated to it and are not in the main article.  If we're going to expand the level of detail that the main article covers, some of those deserve promotion first.  And if you want to get into the \"personal side\", Giuliani's three appearances in drag while mayor (which I researched and wrote up the details on) got put there, instead of in the main article.  Now if we're going to add back some personal side material into the main article, I'd suggest the drag appearances are much more illuminating of Giuliani's character and attitude and nonconformity than how he brushes his teeth or the occupations of his gay friends.  [[User:Wasted Time R|Wasted Time R]] ([[User talk:Wasted Time R|talk]]) 02:44, 4 May 2009 (UTC)\n\n== Republican vs Republian\/Liberal ==\n\nI think that is appropriate to indicate in the lead paragraph that, as a mayoral candidate, Giuliani always ran on the Republican and Liberal lines, as this fact was central to winning the mayor's race, AND to his defeat in the quest for the US presidency.\n[[User:NathanZook|NathanZook]] ([[User talk:NathanZook|talk]]) 01:20, 17 August 2009 (UTC)\n\n:It was certainly part of the story of his mayoral elections, but it had nothing to do with his losing the presidential nomination campaign.  Who gets the Liberal and Conservative Party lines have much to do with the byzantine world of New York state politics, and not so much to do with ideology.  [[User:Wasted Time R|Wasted Time R]] ([[User talk:Wasted Time R|talk]]) 04:27, 21 August 2009 (UTC)\n\n== Transvestism ==\n\nWhy is there no discussion of his history as transvestite?

I have revised the content multiple times and have received only removals stating the content was NNPOV or utilizing politicized sources. As this has been remedied, I fail to see the current complication with the content. I am perfectly happy to revise it, but I do not feel that a person whose background that matches Mr. Giuliani's support for a terrorist group that killed Americans on a paid basis both before and after the de-listing is a subject that ought to be entirely ignored.

She was the wife of first [[Laius]], then of their son [[Oedipus]], and both mother and grandmother of [[Antigone]], [[Eteocles]], [[Polynices]] and [[Ismene]]. She was also sister of [[Creon]] and mother-in-law of [[Haimon]].\n\nAfter his abduction and rape of [[Chrysippus (mythology)|Chrysippus]], Laius married Jocasta.  Laius received an [[oracle]] from [[Delphi]] which told him that he must not have a child with his wife, or the child would kill him and marry her; in another version, recorded by Aeschylus, Laius is warned that he can only save the city if he dies childless.  One night, Laius became drunk and fathered [[Oedipus]] with Jocasta.\n\nJocasta handed the newborn infant over to Laius. Jocasta or Laius pierced and pinned the infant's ankles together. Laius instructed his chief shepherd, a slave who had been born in the palace, to expose the infant on [[Mount Cithaeron]]. Laius's shepherd took pity on the infant and gave him to another shepherd in the employ of King [[Polybus of Corinth]]. Childless, Polybus and his Queen, [[Merope (Oedipus)|Merope]] (according to Sophocles, or [[Periboea]] according to [[Pseudo-Apollodorus]]), raised the infant to adulthood.<ref name=\"Apollodorus. Library, 3.5.7\">Apollodorus. ''Library'', 3.5.7.<\/ref>\n\nOedipus grew up in Corinth under the assumption that he was the biological son of Polybus and his wife. Hearing rumors about his parentage, he consulted the Delphic Oracle. Oedipus was informed by the Oracle that he was fated to kill his father and to marry his mother. Fearing for the safety of the only parents known to him, Oedipus fled from Corinth before he could commit these sins. During his travels, Oedipus encountered Laius on the road. After a heated argument regarding right-of-way, Oedipus killed Laius, unknowingly fulfilling the first half of the prophecy. Oedipus continued his journey to Thebes and discovered that the city was being terrorized by the [[sphinx]]. Oedipus solved the sphinx's riddle, and the grateful city elected Oedipus as their new king; Oedipus accepted the throne and married Laius' widowed queen Jocasta, fulfilling the second half of the prophecy. Jocasta bore him four children: two girls, [[Antigone]] and [[Ismene]], and two boys, [[Eteocles]] and [[Polynices]]. When his city was struck by a plague, Oedipus learned that it was divine punishment for his patricide and incest. Hearing this news, Jocasta hanged herself.<ref>Sophocles, ''Oedipus Rex'', 1191\u20131312.<\/ref> Alternatively, Jocasta endured the burden of disgrace and continued to live in Thebes, committing suicide later after her sons kill one another in a fight for the crown (see [[Seven Against Thebes]]).<ref name=\"Statius\">Statius, ''Thebaid'', Book XI<\/ref> In both traditions Oedipus gouges out his eyes; Sophocles has Oedipus go into exile with his daughter Antigone, but Statius has him residing within Thebes' walls during the war between Eteocles and Polynices.<ref name=\"Statius\" \/>\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Oedipus the King]]'' by [[Sophocles]] is an ancient Greek retelling of this legend as a play.\n*[[Jocasta complex]] describing the usually latent sexual desire that a mother has for a son or alternatively the domineering and intense, but non-incestuous love that a mother has for an intelligent son, and an often absent or weak father figure.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*Seneca, ''Oedipus'' 1024\u201341.\n*Statius, ''Thebais'' XI.634\u2013644.\n\n{{Oedipus}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Women in Greek mythology]]\n[[Category:Ancient Greek queens consort]]\n[[Category:Theban mythology]]","timestamp":"20160410102630","user-timestamp":"20150410102630"},{"title":"Talk:Giacomo Mazzocchi","content":"{{WikiProject Biography\n|living=no\n|class=stub\n|listas=Mazzocchi, Giacomo\n}}","timestamp":"20160410102630","user-timestamp":"20150410102630"},{"title":"Cynosurus","content":"{{italic title}}\n{{taxobox\n|image = Cynosurus echinatus \u2014 Flora Batava \u2014 Volume v20.jpg\n|image_caption = ''[[Cynosurus echinatus ]]''<ref> 1898 illustration from \nJanus (Jan) Kops (1765\u20131849)& F.

It stars Swedish-born actress [[Greta Garbo]] and [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]] in their fourth and last film together.\n\nThe film portrays the life of [[Queen Christina of Sweden]] who became monarch at the age of six in 1632 and grew to be a powerful and influential leader. As well as the demands of being a war-leader during the [[Thirty Year's War]] Queen Christina is expected to marry a suitable royal figure and produce an heir. However, she falls in love with a visiting Spanish [[envoy (title)|envoy]]  whom she is forbidden to marry as he is a [[Roman Catholic]] and must choose between love and her royal duty.\n\nThe film was a major commercial and critical success in the U.S.A. and worldwide.\n\n==Background==\nThe film was directed by [[Rouben Mamoulian]] in 1933, and written by H. M. Harwood and [[Salka Viertel]], with dialogue by [[S. N. Behrman]], based on a story by [[Salka Viertel]] and Margaret P. Levino. Leading roles are played by [[Greta Garbo]] and [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]], whose career heavily declined with the rise of talkies.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Films of Greta Garbo |author=Michael Conway, Dion McGregor, Mark Ricci |year=1968 |publisher=The Citadel Press |location=New York |isbn= |page=119 |url= |accessdate=}}<\/ref> Garbo herself insisted on Gilbert as her co-star.<ref name=\"pyramid\">{{cite book |title=Greta Garbo |last=Corliss |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Corliss |year=1974 |publisher=Pyramid Books |location=New York |isbn= |page=110 |url= |accessdate=}}<\/ref> It was the fourth and the last time they starred together in the same film. ''Queen Christina'' was billed as Garbo's return to cinema after an eighteen-month hiatus. Prior to the shooting, while on holiday in Sweden, the actress read a treatment by Salka Viertel about the life of Christina and became interested in the story.<ref name=\"pyramid\"\/> At the time of shooting the film, Garbo was 28, the age of her character.<ref>{{cite book |title=Greta Garbo |last=Corliss |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Corliss |year=1974 |publisher=Pyramid Books |location=New York |isbn= |page=112 |url= |accessdate=}}<\/ref>\n\n''Queen Christina'' is a historical [[costume drama]], loosely based on the life of 17th century [[Christina, Queen of Sweden|Queen Christina of Sweden]] and still more loosely of Stindberg's history play ''[[Christina, Queen of Sweden#Legacy|Kristina]]''.. Apart from her, a number of other authentic historical characters appear in the film, such as [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden]] and [[Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie]]. Some events that took place in history, like the [[Thirty Years' War]], are represented in the work, although ''Queen Christina'' is not a film closely depicting facts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http:\/\/www.altfg.com\/blog\/classics\/queen-christina-greta-garbo-gilbert-mamoulian\/ |title=QUEEN CHRISTINA \u2013 Greta Garbo, John Gilbert d: Rouben Mamoulian |accessdate=2011-01-19 |work=Alt Film Guide |publisher=www.altfg.com}}<\/ref> In this [[historical fiction]] account, Queen Christina of Sweden falls in love during her reign but has to deal with the political realities of her society. In real life, Christina's main reason for abdication was her determination not to marry and to be able to convert to [[Catholicism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http:\/\/www.windweaver.com\/christina\/movie.htm |title=Queen Christina of Sweden movie with Greta Garbo by Tracy Marks |accessdate=2007-03-28 |publisher=www.windweaver.com}}<\/ref> Another fictionalized, if not entirely fictitious, element is the romantic affair between Christina and Antonio. However, the queen's habit of dressing as a man in order to broaden the options available to her as a person is clearly marked in the film: \"I shall die a bachelor!\" she declares, wears manly clothes and even disguises herself as a man.<ref>{{cite web |url=http:\/\/www.allmovie.com\/movie\/queen-christina-v39808\/ |title=Queen Christina \u2013 Cast, Reviews, Summary, and Awards |author=Hal Erickson |accessdate=2011-01-19 |work=AllMovie |publisher=www.allmovie.com}}<\/ref> The only concession to the real Christina's sexuality were some subtle hints that the film character was romantically attracted to one of her ladies in waiting.<ref>{{cite web|title=Queen Christina|first=Frank|last=Miller|url=http:\/\/www.tcm.com\/this-month\/article\/29966%7C0\/Queen-Christina.html|publisher=[[Turner Entertainment Networks, Inc.]]|work=tcm.com|date=|accessdate=18 October 2015}}<\/ref>\nThe film itself is remembered for no less than two cult scenes.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kobal |first=John |authorlink=John Kobal |year=1979 |title=Garbo |journal=The Movie |volume= |issue= |pages=29 |publisher=Orbis Publishing |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}<\/ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http:\/\/shewasabird.blogspot.com\/2010\/01\/queen-christina-1933.html |title=Queen Christina (1933) |author= |accessdate=2012-02-22 |publisher=blogspot.com}}<\/ref> The first one, over three minutes long, shows Christina walking around the room, having spent a night with Antonio at the inn. She touches various objects to imprint the space on her memory. The second one, arguably the most famous image in the film, is the closing shot, showing Christina standing as a silent figurehead at the bow of the ship bound for Spain. With the wind blowing through her hair, the camera moves into a tight close-up on her face. Prior to shooting the final scene, Mamoulian suggested that Garbo should think about nothing and avoid blinking her eyes, so that her face could be a \"blank sheet of paper\" and every member of the audience could write the ending of the film themselves.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kobal |first=John |authorlink=John Kobal |year=1979 |title=Garbo |journal=The Movie |volume= |issue= |pages=28 |publisher=Orbis Publishing |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}<\/ref> Amusingly, this shot also contains one of the greatest continuity errors in movie history: The wind blowing Garbo's hair is moving in the ''opposite'' direction from the wind blowing the ship's sails.\n\n==Plot==\nQueen Christina of Sweden ([[Greta Garbo]]) is very devoted to her country and the welfare of her people. As queen, Christina favors peace for Sweden. At one point in the film she argues for an end to the [[Thirty Years' War]], saying:\n<blockquote>Spoils, glory, flags and trumpets! What is behind these high-sounding words? Death and destruction, triumphals of crippled men, Sweden victorious in a ravaged Europe, an island in a dead sea. I tell you, I want no more of it. I want for my people security and happiness. I want to cultivate the arts of peace, the arts of life. I want peace and peace I will have!<\/blockquote>\n\nChristina, who first took the throne at age six upon the death of her father in battle, is depicted as so devoted to both governing well and educating herself that she has spurned any kind of serious romance or marriage despite pressures from her councilors and court to marry her hero-cousin Karl Gustav ([[Reginald Owen]]) and produce an heir. One day, in an effort to escape the restrictions of her royal life, she sneaks out of town, disguised as a man, and ends up snowbound at an inn, where she has to share a bed with also stranded Spanish envoy Antonio ([[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]]) on his way to the capital. After befriending, and upon revealing that she is a woman, then sharing the same bed, the two fall in love; however, she still has not revealed that she is the queen. After a few idyllic nights together, Christina and Antonio are compelled to part, but Christina promises to find him in [[Stockholm]] \u2013 which she does, when the Spaniard presents his embassy to the Queen, whom he recognizes as his lover. Antonio is angry as he has come to present an offer of marriage from the King of Spain to Queen Christina and feels that his loyalty to the king has been compromised. She makes clear that she will not accept the king's proposal and Christina and Antonio patch up their differences.\n\nWhen Count Magnus ([[Ian Keith]]), who wants the Queen's affections for his own, riles up the people against the Spaniard, Christina abdicates the throne, nominating her cousin Karl Gustav as her successor while declining to marry him. She leaves Sweden to catch up with Don Antonio who has just left for a neighboring country, but she finds him gravely wounded from a sword duel he had with Magnus, which he lost. Antonio dies in her arms. She resolves to proceed with her voyage to Spain where she envisions residing in Antonio's home on the white cliffs overlooking the sea.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Col-start}}\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Greta Garbo]] as [[Christina, Queen of Sweden]]\n* [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]] as Antonio\n* [[Ian Keith]] as [[Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie]]\n* [[Lewis Stone]] as [[Axel Oxenstierna]]\n* [[Elizabeth Young (actress)|Elizabeth Young]] as [[Ebba Sparre|Countess Ebba Sparre]]\n* [[C.

If you have evidence of this behavior, it should be submitted to Arbcom (not just to Viriditas or other editors you know) for review. If you don't have evidence, or you're unwilling to share that evidence with Arbcom, you will need to stop leveling such accusations at others until such time as you ''are'' able\/willing to produce the evidence, as to continue to do so without that would be a blockable personal attack.

He believed that the chapel and the village was based in a very remote and narrow location. After, the El Sueldo's inhabitants moved their homes near the river; and just there, Correa began a new church in August 1904, with plans drawn by the architect Emigdio Rinc\u00f3n. Nevertheless, the end of the building was done by the Correa's successors.\n\nThe church has three [[nave]]s and one tower; and into that, three altars; one is the high altar, another has the Arcangel Rafel image, and the other one, the image of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.\n\nIn front of the [[facade]] is the principal town's principal square; with a [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Correa.\n\n== References ==\n\n<references\/>\n{{coord missing|Colombia}}\n\n[[Category:Churches in Colombia|Raphael's]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic churches in Colombia]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Antioquia Department]]\n\n\n{{Colombia-church-stub}}","timestamp":"20160410102644","user-timestamp":"20150410102644"},{"title":"User talk:Mihir26","content":"My talk page.","timestamp":"20160410102645","user-timestamp":"20150410102645"},{"title":"User talk:24.43.156.210","content":"{{OW}}","timestamp":"20160410102646","user-timestamp":"20150410102646"},{"title":"Template:Cite doi\/10.1038.2Fnn1399","content":"{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Amat | first1 = J. \n| last2 = Baratta | first2 = M.

Do not edit related articles. [[Wikipedia:COI#Advice for editors who may have a conflict of interest|(Exceptions.)]]\n* Post suggestions and sources on the article's talk page, or create a draft in your user space.\n* Your role is to summarize, inform and reference &mdash; not to [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style\/Words to watch#Puffery|promote, sell]], or whitewash.\n* If writing a draft, write without bias, as if you don't work for the company or personally know the subject.\n* Have us review your draft.\n* Work with us and we'll work with you.\n\nPlease familiarize yourself with relevant content policies and guidelines, especially those pertaining to [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]], [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiability of information]], and [[Wikipedia:Autobiography|autobiographies]].\n\nFor information on how to contribute to Wikipedia when you have a conflict of interest, please see [[Wikipedia:FAQ\/Organizations|our frequently asked questions for organizations]].

Secondly, one of those five\u2014Grande Rock\u2014was already disregarded as a professional source in an extensive discussion\/argument [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources\/Noticeboard\/Archive 136#Grande_Rock|here]]; therefore it simply [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Albums\/Sources#List of unreliable sources .28with link to relevant discussion.29|cannot be on that section]], or used as critical analysis within the article body.

It was during this period that Tao earned the name \"Housewife Killer\" due to his overwhelming popularity amongst housewives (who arguably constitutes a majority of TV viewing audiences in Hong Kong), solidifying his position as a 1st tier television actor in TVB.\n\nTao later moved over to rival [[Asia Television|ATV]] in 1997 after problems over his contract with TVB. His ATV series [[Flaming Brothers]] successfully defeated the TVB rival show at the time, a landmark for ATV. Apart from filming ATV series, Tao has also filmed in China and Singapore. He returned to [[Television Broadcasts Limited|TVB]] in 2004 and has starred in a number of television series since. Once again, problems with his contract resulted in Tao leaving TVB in 2009.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===TVB===\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#B0C4DE\" align=\"center\"\n!Year\n!Title\n!Role\n![[TVB Anniversary Awards]]\n|-\n|1985 || ''[[The Yangs Saga]]'' || ||\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1986 || ''[[New Heavenly Sword and Dragon Sabre]]'' || ||\n|-\n|''[[The Legend Of Dik Ching]]'' || ||\n|-\n|1987 || ''[[Genghis Khan (TVB)|Genghis Khan]]'' || [[Muqali|Muk-Wah-Lai]] ||\n|-\n|1988 || ''[[Twilight of a Nation]]'' || Lee Chiu-Sau ||\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1989 || ''[[The Black Sabre]]'' || ||\n|-\n|''[[The War Heroes]]'' || ||\n|-\n|1991 || ''[[The Breaking Point (1991 TV series)|The Breaking Point]]'' || ||\n|-\n|1992 || ''[[File of Justice]]'' || ||\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\" | 1993 || ''[[Ambition (1993 film)|Ambition]]'' || ||\n|-\n|''[[For Home Sake]]'' || ||\n|-\n|''[[The Greed of Man]]'' || ||\n|-\n|''[[File Of Justice II]]'' || ||\n|-\n|''[[The Partner]]'' || ||\n|-\n|1994 || ''[[File Of Justice III]]'' || ||\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\" | 1995 || ''[[File Of Justice IV]]'' || ||\n|-\n|''[[File Of Justice V]]'' || ||\n|-\n|''[[Detective Investigation Files]]'' || ||\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1996 || ''[[Detective Investigation Files II]]'' || ||\n|-\n|''[[Ambition (TV series)|Ambition]]'' || Kwok Ka-bo ||\n|-\n|1997 || ''[[Detective Investigation Files III]]'' || ||\n|-\n|2004 || ''[[Shine On You]]'' || ||\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 2005 || ''[[Love Bond]]'' || ||\n|-\n|''[[Fantasy Hotel]]'' ||  Kam Chi Kit (Bob) ||\n|-\n|2007 || ''[[On the First Beat]]'' || Cheung King-Fung || [[TVB Anniversary Awards (2007)|Best Actor Nomination (Top 20)]]\n|-\n|2008 || ''[[Wasabi Mon Amour]]'' ||  Chung Lai Wo ||\n|-\n|2010 || ''[[Sisters of Pearl]]'' || ||\n|}\n\n===ATV===\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#B0C4DE\" align=\"center\"\n!

We're a group of editors who strive to improve the quality of anatomy articles here on Wikipedia. One of our members has noticed that you are involved in editing anatomy articles; it's great to have a new interested editor on board. In your wiki-voyages, a few things that may be relevant to editing wikipedia articles are:\n[[File:Sobo 1909 589.png|200px|thumbnail|left]]\n* '''Thanks for coming aboard!''' We always appreciate a new editor. Feel free to leave us a message at any time [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Anatomy|on the WikiProkect Anatomy talk page]].  If you are interested in joining the project yourself, there is a [[:Wikipedia:WikiProject_Anatomy#Participants|participant list]] where you can sign up. Please leave a message on the talk page if you have any problems, suggestions, would like review of an article, need suggestions for articles to edit, or would like some collaboration when editing!\n* You will make a '''big difference''' to the quality of information by adding '''[[WP:MEDRS|reliable sources]]'''. Sourcing anatomy articles is essential and makes a big difference to the quality of articles. And, while you're at it, why not use a [[book]] to source information, which can source multiple articles at once!\n* We try and use a '''standard way of arranging the content''' in each article. '''[[:Wikipedia:MEDMOS#Anatomy|That layout is here]].''' These headings let us have a standard way of presenting the information in anatomical articles, indicate what information may have been forgotten, and save angst when trying to decide how to organise an article. That said, this might not suit every article. If in doubt, '''[[WP:BRD|be bold]]'''!\n* Lastly, why not try and strive to create a '''[[WP:GA|good article]]'''!

She broke into the sport in 1948 originally skating for a league called International Roller Speedway.  Calvello, who often sported dyed hair and wild makeup, was known for her temper along with her unconventional looks.  She was nicknamed \"Banana-Nose\" by fans.  She traveled the world skating in [[Europe]], [[Guam]], [[Philippines]], [[Cuba]], [[Australia]] and of course all over the United States.  She broke her nose 12 times during her career.  Her most famous rival on the track was the late [[Joan Weston]].\n\nAnn gave birth to a daughter, Teri Ann Langley-Conte, on August 11, 1953.  Following her initial retirement, in 1968, she was inducted into the [[Roller Derby Hall of Fame]].<ref>\"[http:\/\/www.rollerderbyhalloffame.com\/id5.html Events & Inductees]\", [[Roller Derby Hall of Fame]]<\/ref>\n\nIn 2001, ''Demon Of The Derby'', a biographical documentary film about Calvello, was completed by Fireproof Productions. It has been released on DVD, and is occasionally screened at fundraisers organized by roller derby leagues.\n\nIn 2005, Calvello contributed many rare photos and clippings from her personal collection to the book ''Roller Derby Classics\u2026and more!'' by Jim Fitzpatrick, published by [[Trafford Publishing]].  She also wrote the foreword to the book.\n\nOn February 27, 2006, Calvello was featured in several episodes of the [[reality television]] show ''[[Rollergirls]]'' that was broadcast on the [[A&E Network]]. In the episode, filmed in 2005, members of the [[TXRD Lonestar Rollergirls]] travelled to [[California]] in search of Cavello, their hero. TXRD has named their championship the Calvello Cup in her honor. Calvello also appeared in the season finale where the Rhinestone Cowgirls and the Holy Rollers battled for the championship.\n\nCalvello last resided in [[San Bruno, California]] with her cats. She never officially retired from roller derby, but had not competed since 2000, although in 2002 she returned to the track one final time to win a match race with Kenneth Loge III on the finale of ''[[WSL RollerJam|RollerJam]]''.  In early 2006, she was diagnosed with [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]], and died at the age of 76 soon after.\n\n{{start box}}\n{{s-sport}}\n{{succession box|title=International Roller Derby League Female [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]]<ref name=MVP>Keith Coppage, ''Roller Derby to RollerJam'', p.123<\/ref>|years=1963|before=Bobbie Mateer|after=Carol Meyer}}\n{{end box}}\n\n==References==\n<references \/>\n* {{cite news|title=Queen of the Jungle: Meet a 67-year-old Roller Derby queen who can't get her skates off|url=http:\/\/www.metroactive.com\/papers\/metro\/05.01.97\/slices-9718.html|date=1997-05-01|first=Ami Chen|last=Mills|publisher=''Metro'' (Silicon Valley weekly)}}\n* {{cite press release|title=Roller Derby Legend Ann Calvello to \"Lace Up Skates\" as a Special Guest On TNN's \"ROLLERJAM\" Series|publisher=Business Wire (via FindArticles)|date=2000-06-01|url=http:\/\/findarticles.com\/p\/articles\/mi_m0EIN\/is_2000_June_1\/ai_62415835|accessdate=2007-10-09}}\n* {{cite news|title=The Lioness in Winter: At age 72, Ann Theresa Calvello, the Roller Derby Queen, is the subject of a movie \u2014 and as salty as ever|url=http:\/\/www.sfweekly.com\/2001-08-29\/news\/the-lioness-in-winter\/|last=Tudor|first=Silke|publisher=''S.F.

The term is also used to describe the particular brand of leather itself, when fitted in a car interior.\n\nConnolly supplied most of the leather for the British car industry, including but not limited to [[Aston Martin]] & [[Lagonda]], [[Rolls-Royce Motors|Rolls-Royce]] & [[Bentley]], [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] & [[Daimler Company|Daimler]], and [[Rover (marque)|Rover]] cars including its [[Land Rover]] and [[Range Rover]] vehicles as well as some [[MG Cars|MG]] and [[Mini]] models during the [[Rover Group]] era. Non-British makes included [[Ferrari]] and [[Maserati]], [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]] and [[Lexus]]. This leather was also used for the seats in the [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s used in World War 2{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}.\n\nConnolly leather gained such prominence in the world of luxury travel beyond cars, such as private jets and yachts, that it was selected for high profile projects as [[Concorde]] and the [[Queen Elizabeth 2]] ocean liner.\n\nConnolly also reached the world of interiors and design, with Mies Van Der Rohe's original Barcelona chairs upholstered with Connolly leather as well as the benches in Britain's Houses of Parliament together with many other parliaments around the world. Connolly earned a Royal Warrant, being appointed Leather Tanners and Curriers to Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nIn addition to upholstery, Connolly Leather has been used in the manufacture of high-end sound audio components such as the [[Bowers & Wilkins|B&W]] Signature 800 series loudspeakers as an expression of the quality and luxury status of the item. Connolly Leather was also used by [[Luxman]] and \"retro-design\" transistor radios from British manufacturer [[Roberts Radio|Roberts]].\n\nThe family started a retail business, Connolly Luxury Leathergoods Limited, selling exclusive and bespoke leather goods and accessories. The business developed a high profile clientele which included celebrities, socialites and industry leaders.\nToday, Connolly accessory designs can be found in museums around the world.\n\nThe company also sold leather-care products (e.g. Connolly Hide-Food); restoring leather is sometimes known as \"Connollising\", thanks to the reputation of the company.\n\nAlthough \"Connollising\" is somewhat shrouded in secret, it basically involves scrubbing down the leather with a cleaner\/soap while using a stiff brush (such as a nail brush) or slightly abrasive sponge which thins and removes most of the original surface color & finish.  The leather is then moisturized and recolored, bringing it back as close to original condition as possible. Connollising involves the leather surface more than the leather itself.  Connollising can not fix cracks or extremely dry leather.  Connollising fixes the \"wear and tear\" of the surface due to typical usage and age (and possibly some neglect).\n\nAlthough the words \"Connollising\" and \"Connolised\" are supposedly legally protected, most restoration companies employ a similar if not the same technique to restore leather and \"bring it back to life,\" except they can not advertise it as \"Connollising.\"\n\nAn attempt to expand into the American market in the 1990s failed badly and Connolly Leather ceased trading in June 2002.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cracks in Connolly's world of leather|url=http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/finance\/2745004\/Cracks-in-Connollys-world-of-leather.html|accessdate=26 August 2013|newspaper=Telegraph|date=9 December 2001}}<\/ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.dtconcours.co.uk\/leather-care.htm |title=Leather care information from |publisher=DT Concours |date= |accessdate=2010-11-28}}<\/ref> However, in 2003,  Jonathan Connolly established C B Leather Ltd and resumed the manufacture and production of high quality leather and now sells under both C B Leather and Connolly.\n\nThe recipes to Connolly Hide-Food and their Leather-Cleaner have since been sold or licensed and have returned to the market.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http:\/\/www.connollyleather.com.au\/history.htm History of Connolly Leather]\n{{-}}\n\n[[Category:Defunct manufacturing companies of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Auto parts suppliers]]\n[[Category:Defunct leather manufacturers]]\n[[Category:Companies established in 1878]]\n[[Category:Companies disestablished in 2002]]","timestamp":"20160410102706","user-timestamp":"20150410102706"},{"title":"Talk:The Cost of Living like This","content":"{{WikiProject Novels|class = stub}}","timestamp":"20160410102707","user-timestamp":"20150410102707"},{"title":"Talk:Uwe Stock","content":"{{WikiProject Biography\n|living=yes\n|class=Stub\n|sports-work-group=yes\n|listas=Stock, Uwe\n}}\n{{WikiProject Germany|class=stub|importance=low}}\n\n\n{{Image requested|sportspeople}}\n\n== [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_Biography\/Assessment#Class_parameter|Biography assessment rating]] comment ==\n[[Wikipedia:WikiProject_Biography\/Assessment\/Assessment_Drive|WikiProject Biography Assessment Drives]]\n\nWant to help write or improve biographies?

Richard Farmer.jpg|thumb|Richard Farmer, portrait by [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]].]]\n'''Dr Richard Farmer''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] [[Society of Antiquaries of London|FSA]] (1735\u20131797) was a [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] scholar and Master of [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]]. He is known for his ''Essay on the Learning of Shakespeare'' (1767), in which he maintained that Shakespeare's knowledge of the classics was through translations, the errors of which he reproduced.\n\n==Life==\nHe was born at [[Leicester]] on 28 August 1735, the second son of Richard Farmer, a maltster, by his wife Hannah, daughter of John Knibb. He was educated under the Rev. Gerrard Andrewes, in the free grammar school at Leicester, and about 1753 entered as a pensioner at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]], where he graduated B.A. in 1757, and was a 'senior optime.'<ref name=Venn>{{acad|id=FRMR753R|name=Farmer, Richard}}<\/ref> He successfully contested with Wanley Sawbridge for the silver cup given at Emmanuel College to the best graduate of that year. In 1760 he commenced M.A., and succeeded the Rev. Mr. Bickham as classical tutor of his college. For many years, while tutor, he served the curacy of [[Swavesey]].<ref name=DNB>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Farmer, Richard|volume=18|author=[[Thompson Cooper]]|vb=1}}<\/ref>\n\nOn 19 May 1763 Farmer was elected a [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries]]. In 1765 he was junior proctor of the university. He had already formed an extensive library and had acquired a reputation as a scholar and antiquary. When [[Samuel Johnson]] visited Cambridge in 1765 he had a 'joyous meeting' with Farmer at Emmanuel.<ref>An account written by an eye-witness, B. N. Turner, of Denton, Lincolnshire, is in the ''[[New Monthly Magazine]]'' for December 1818 (x. 388).<\/ref> The two scholars afterwards maintained a correspondence on literary topics; on one occasion Johnson requested Farmer to help [[George Steevens]] on translations which Shakespeare might have seen, and on another he himself asked for information from the university registers on Cambridge graduates in the ''[[Lives of the Poets]]''.<ref name=DNB\/>\n\nIn 1767 he took the degree of B.D., and on 8 July 1769 [[Richard Terrick]], bishop of London, appointed him one of the preachers at the [[Chapel Royal, Whitehall]]. When in London he usually resided at the house of Dr. [[Anthony Askew]], the eminent physician, in [[Queen Square, London|Queen Square, Bloomsbury]]. In 1775, on the death of Dr. Richardson, he was chosen master of Emmanuel College, Henry Hubbard, the senior fellow, having declined the post. He now took the degree of D.D., and was very soon succeeded in the tutorship by Dr. [[William Bennet (bishop)|William Bennet]], later [[bishop of Cloyne]].<ref name=DNB\/>\n\nHe served the office of vice-chancellor of the university in 1775\u20136, and again in 1787\u20138. During his first term of office the university voted an address to the king, in support of the American policy of the government. One member of the Caput refused to give up the key of the place containing the university seal, and Farmer is said to have forced open the door with a sledge-hammer\u2014an exploit which some biographers allege to have been the cause of all his subsequent preferments. On the death of Dr. Barnardiston, master of Corpus Christi College, he was (27 June 1778) unanimously elected principal librarian of the university. In April 1780 he was [[wikt:collate|collated]] by Bishop [[Richard Hurd (bishop)|Richard Hurd]] to the [[Prebendary|prebend]] of Alrewas in [[Lichfield Cathedral]]. In March 1782 he was installed a canon in the ninth prebend of the church of Canterbury. After enjoying this prebend for several years he resigned it on being preferred by William Pitt to a canonry residentiary and the prebend of Consumpta-per-Mare at [[St Paul's Cathedral]], on 19 March 1788.<ref name=DNB\/>\n\nThe last years of his life were divided between Emmanuel College and the residentiary house in [[Amen Corner, London|Amen Corner]]. He was a member of clubs: the Eum\u00e9lean Club at Blenheim Tavern, Bond Street, of which Dr. [[John Ash (physician)|John Ash]] was president, the Unincreasable Club, Queen's Head, Holborn, of which [[Isaac Reed]] was president, and the Literary Club, founded by Dr. Johnson and [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]]. Farmer twice declined a bishopric that was offered to him by Pitt as a reward for his Tory principles. In 1796 he was admitted ''[[ad eundem]]'' at Oxford.<ref name=DNB\/>\n\nHe died, after a long and painful illness, at the lodge of Emmanuel College, on 8 September 1797, and was buried in the chapel. A monument was erected to his memory in the cloisters, inscribed with a Latin epitaph composed by [[Samuel Parr]]. A portrait of him was engraved by [[John Jones (engraver)|John Jones]] from a painting by [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]].<ref name=DNB\/>\n\n==Works==\nHis friend [[Isaac Reed]] remarked on his easy way at Emmanuel as a successful Master; but as a scholar he was not productive. When a young man he wrote some ''Directions for Studying the English History'', which were printed in the ''[[European Magazine]]'' for 1791 and in [[William Seward (anecdotist)|William Seward]]'s ''Biographiana''.<ref name=DNB\/>\n\nOn 15 May 1766 Farmer issued from the university press proposals for printing the history of Leicester, written by [[Thomas Staveley]]; but eventually abandoned this plan. Staveley's collections, together with those of the Rev. [[Samuel Carte]], several original manuscripts, and some engraved plates, he presented to [[John Nichols (printer)|John Nichols]], who made use of them in his work ''Leicestershire''.<ref name=DNB\/>\n\nIn 1767 he brought out the first edition of his only published work, an ''Essay on the Learning of Shakspeare'' (Cambridge), addressed to his friend and schoolfellow, [[Joseph Cradock]] of Gumley. A second expanded edition came out in the same year. A third edition was printed at London in 1789. A fourth edition appeared at London in 1821. The essay is also in [[George Steevens]]'s edition of Shakespeare 1793, in Reed's edition 1803, in Harris's edition 1812, and in Boswell's 'Variorum,\u2019 1821. Farmer proposed that Shakespeare's knowledge of classical history was obtained at second hand through translations.<ref name=DNB\/>\n\nHis library, rich in scarce tracts and old English literature, was sold in London in 1798. The catalogue extends to 379 pages, and the separate books number 8,155; it sold for \u00a32,210. A scurrilous pamphlet, entitled 'The Battle between Dr. Farmer and Peter Musgrave, the Cambridge Taylor, in Hudibrastic verse,\u2019 appeared at London in 1792.<ref name=DNB\/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Cite SBDEL|wstitle=Farmer, Richard|vb=1}}\n\n==External links==\n{{EB1911 Poster|Farmer, Richard|Richard Farmer}}\n*{{worldcat id|lccn-n88-85791}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-aca}}\n{{succession box |\n  before=[[William Richardson (Emmanuel)|William Richardson]]\n|title= [[List of Masters of Emmanuel College|Master of]] [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]]\n |\n  years=1775\u20131797 |\n  after=[[Robert Towerson Cory]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Farmer, Richard}}\n[[Category:1735 births]]\n[[Category:1797 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Leicester]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Emmanuel College, Cambridge]]\n[[Category:Masters of Emmanuel College, Cambridge]]\n[[Category:Shakespearean scholars]]\n[[Category:Vice-Chancellors of the University of Cambridge]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Royal Society]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London]]\n[[Category:Cambridge University Librarians]]","timestamp":"20160410102731","user-timestamp":"20150410102731"},{"title":"Talk:Ubarri (Pueblo)","content":"{{WikiProjectBannerShell|1=\n{{WikiProject Urban studies and planning|class=Stub|importance=Mid}}\n{{WikiProject Architecture|class=Stub|importance=Mid}}\n{{WikiProject Caribbean|class=Stub|importance=Mid}}\n{{WikiProject United States Territories|class=stub|importance=low\n}}\n}}","timestamp":"20160410102732","user-timestamp":"20150410102732"},{"title":"User talk:Jpbrenna\/archive9","content":"","timestamp":"20160410102732","user-timestamp":"20150410102732"},{"title":"User talk:71.100.233.218","content":"{{{icon|[[Image:Information.svg|25px]] }}}Welcome, and thank you for experimenting with {{{{{subst|}}}#if:Jupiter|the page [[:Jupiter]] on}} Wikipedia.

Because of these rigorous test,  only 1 in 139,000 actually make it through to be used in agriculture. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nFIFRA established a set of pesticide regulations:{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n#FIFRA established registration for all [[pesticide]]s, which is only done after a period of data collection to determine the effectiveness for its intended use, appropriate dosage, and hazards of the particular material. When registered, a label is created to instruct the final user the proper usage of the material. If instructions are ignored, users are liable for any negative  consequences. <br>Label directions are designed to maximize the effectiveness of the product, while protecting the applicator, consumers, and the environment. Critics of the process point out on the one hand that the research to produce the label is entirely done by the manufacturer and not much checking is done on its accuracy. On the other hand, some consider the process too strict. It costs millions of dollars and often several years to register a pesticide, which limits production only to large players. Likewise many smaller or specialty uses are never registered, because the companies do not consider the potential sales sufficient to justify the investment.\n#Only a few pesticides are made available to the general public. Most pesticides are considered too hazardous for general use, and are restricted to certified applicators. FIFRA established a system of examination and certification both at the private level and at the commercial level for applicators who wish to purchase and use [[restricted use pesticide]]s. The distribution of restricted pesticides is also monitored.\n#The EPA has different review processes for three categories of pesticides: [[antimicrobial]]s, [[biopesticide]]s, and conventional pesticides.  The three categories have a similar application process, but have different data requirements and review policies.  Depending on the category of pesticide, the review process can take several years.  After a pesticide is registered with the EPA, there may be [[state registration]] requirements to consider.\n#In addition to the rules and regulations given by the EPA, the states may also offer an additional set of rules and registration requirements for a registered pesticide. They can also request annual usage reports from the pesticide users.\n\nIn addition to the FIFRA, the Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 amended the authorized fees for certain products, assessed the process of collecting maintenance fees, and decided on a review process for approving the pesticides. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2007 renewed these changes to stay in place until 2012. The purpose of the PRIA is to ensure a smooth implementation of pesticide rules and regulations to its users.\n\n===Import and export===\n\nPesticides intended for import into the U.S. require a complete Notice of Arrival (NOA) through U.S. Customs and Border Protection. If this NOA is not complete the product would not make it through customs.

A few exceptions allow a pesticide to be exempt from registration requirements. There must be a label on each pesticide describing, in detail, instructions for safe use. Under the act, the EPA must identify each pesticide as \"general use\", \"restricted use\", or both. \"General use\" labeled pesticides are available to anyone in the general public. Those labeled as \"restricted use\" require specific credentials and certifications through the EPA (certified applicator).<ref name=EPA\/>\n\nAlthough FIFRA is generally enforced by the EPA, Sections 23, 24, 26 and 27 extend primary enforcement authorities to the states.<ref name=Statutes \/>  However, EPA authority always supersedes state authority, and primary state authority can be rescinded if the state fails to assure safe enforcement of pesticides usage.<ref name=Statutes \/>  Section 9 authorizes inspection of pesticides in storage for sale or distribution.<ref name=Statutes \/>  Under Section 13, EPA may issue a Stop Sale, Use or Removal Order (SSURO) to prevent the sale or distribution of violative pesticides and for the authority to seize these pesticides.<ref name=EPA \/><ref name=Statutes \/>  Section 15 provides indemnity payments for suspended or cancelled registrations.<ref name=Statutes \/> Section 16 allows for a judicial review process for individuals or entities affected by an EPA order or action.<ref name=Statutes \/>\n \nSection 14 establishes civil and federal penalties for violative acts.  Some examples of these unlawful acts include:<ref name=\"Finegan, FIFRA Lite\" \/><ref name=\"Utah, reregistration and fifra\" \/>\n\n#Distributing, selling, or delivering any unregistered pesticide.\n#Making any advertising claim about a pesticide not included in the registration statement.\n#Selling any registered pesticide if its content does not conform to label data.\n#Falsification of any test-related information or the submission of any false data to support registration.\n#Selling an adulterated or misbranded pesticide.\n#Detaching, altering, defacing, or destroying any part of a container or label.\n#Refusing to keep records or permit authorized EPA inspections.\n#Making a guarantee other than that specified by the label.\n#Advertising a restricted-use pesticide without giving the product classification.\n#Making a restricted-use pesticide available to a non-certified applicator (except as provided by law).\n#Using a pesticide in any manner not consistent with the label.\n\n===Civil penalties===\n\nWhen determining civil penalties, the EPA would take into consideration the severity of infraction, effects of penalties, and size of business.<ref name=\"Utah, reregistration and fifra\" \/>   Under Section 14 (a)(1), commercial applicators, wholesalers, dealers, and retailers \u201cmay be assessed a civil penalty\u2026of not more than $5,000 for each offense\u201d.<ref name=\"Utah, reregistration and fifra\" \/>  Private applicators would be given a warning for the first offense, and a fine up to $1000 may be assessed for each subsequent violation.<ref name=\"Utah, reregistration and fifra\" \/>\n\n===Federal\/criminal penalties===\n\nViolative acts are charged as misdemeanors and subject to fines and\/or imprisonment.<ref name=\"Utah, reregistration and fifra\" \/> A private applicator is subject to $1000 and\/or 30 days imprisonment.  A commercial applicator is subject to $25,000 and\/or up to one year imprisonment.<ref name=\"Utah, reregistration and fifra\" \/>  A manufacturer or producer is subject to $50,000 and\/or up to one year imprisonment.<ref name=\"Finegan, FIFRA Lite\" \/><ref name=\"Utah, reregistration and fifra\" \/>\n\n==Special review==\nFIFRA requires the EPA to continually monitor and update registered pesticides for any new information concerning their safety. Registrants are required to promptly report any new evidence of adverse side effects and to continually conduct studies to aid in risk assessments.<ref name=Statutes \/>  If new information indicates adverse side effects, then EPA may conduct a special review to assess the risks and benefit of continued use of the suspect pesticide.  With the completion of a special review, EPA may choose to amend or cancel the registration.<ref name=Statutes \/>\n\n== Pesticides and endangered species ==\nThe [[Endangered Species Act]] protects and promotes animal and plant recovery of ones in danger of extinction due to human activity. Under this act the EPA must also consider the dangers of animals and plants when registering a new pesticide. The pesticide must not harm the listed endangered and threatened animals and habitats. To be sure this program is implemented, some labels will direct users of the pesticides to bulletins with specific information regarding use. The protection program has 2 main goals: (1) provide the best protection of endangered species from pesticides and (2) minimize the impact of the program on pesticide users.<ref name=EPA\/>\n\nTo protect the endangered species with the EPA program, the following was implemented:<ref name=EPA\/>\n\n#sound science is used to assess risk to the listed species\n#there is an attempt at finding means to avoid concerns of listed species\n#When concerns of the listed species aren't avoidable, they consult with the Fish and Wildlife Services scientist\n#Implement usage limitations when the Fish and Wildlife service express a potential adverse effect on a particular species based on a biological opinion\n\nIn order to implement the usage limitations mentioned above, the EPA will:<ref name=EPA\/>\n\n#add a generic label to the pesticide\n#develop bulletins containing habitat location and pesticide use limitations\n#distributing the bulletins containing this information to pesticide users\n#providing a toll-free number for users to contact regarding information in bulletins and how to obtain one\n\n== Conflicts with other laws and acts ==\n\nIn the instance that another act or law conflicts with the FIFRA, much consideration is taken. The main conflict with the FIFRA is the [[Clean Water Act]]. The biggest controversy is if pesticides were to touch U.S. waters, which would govern how it is handled. Pesticides regulated under FIFRA do not require regulation under the CWA. The EPA also never required CWA to get permission for the FIFRA approved pesticides.\n\nPesticides used for irrigation and weed control may not be necessarily controlled by the FIFRA and causes conflict with the CWA on who should govern because of it being in water.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Agriculture ministry]]\n* [[Endangered Species Act]]\n* [[Paris Green]]\n* [[Pesticide]]\n* [[Pesticide misuse]]\n* [[Restricted pesticides]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http:\/\/www.epa.gov\/lawsregs\/laws\/fifra.html EPA summary of FIFRA laws concerning pesticides]\n* [http:\/\/www.epa.gov\/pesticides\/regulating\/index.htm EPA summary on regulating pesticides]\n* [http:\/\/www.epa.gov\/pesticides\/pestlabels\/ EPA Pesticide Product Label System ]\n* Copies of the labels of most pesticides registered in the USA can be obtained at [http:\/\/www.cdms.net\/manuf\/manuf.asp Crop Data Management Systems, Inc.]\n* [http:\/\/www.campuserc.org\/resources\/EHSguide\/FIFRA\/Pages\/default.aspx Environmental Resource Center for Higher Education]\n* [http:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=teM4HN2XpuUC&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1&dq=laws+and+acts+that+overlap+FIFRA&source=bl&ots=vc30xZMlCH&sig=9acJm_4SqQpRPISB9W98xa1KfJQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=tF2fT8XFBYiC8QS9z7m-AQ&ved=0CFcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=laws%20and%20acts%20that%20overlap%20FIFRA&f=false Pesticide Use and Water Quality: Are the Laws Complementary or in Conflict ]\n\n{{Pesticide regulation in the United States}}\n{{US Environmental law}}\n\n[[Category:1972 in law]]\n[[Category:92nd United States Congress]]\n[[Category:United States federal environmental legislation|Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act]]\n[[Category:Law articles needing an infobox]]\n[[Category:Pesticides in the United States]]\n[[Category:1972 in the environment]]","timestamp":"20160410102741","user-timestamp":"20150410102741"},{"title":"User talk:78.146.98.116","content":"\n\n== May 2011 ==\n[[Image:Information.svg|left|25px|alt=|link=]] Welcome to Wikipedia.

This means it is basically a sphere but it bulges around the middle. The [[circumference]] of the Earth is about 40,000 kilometers; the average width of the Earth is about 12,700 kilometers. The highest point on Earth is the peak of Mount Everest at 8,848 meters above sea level. The lowest natural point is the bottom of the Mariana Trench at 10,911 meters below sea level. Because of the bulge at the middle or the equator, the farthest point from the Earth's center is the top of Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador.<ref>\"Origin of the Moon and Earth\". Reisch, Maggy.

It has an outer, solid rock layer called the crust. Everything that lives on Earth is on top of the crust. Below that is a layer of thick, semi-liquid rock called the mantle. Under that is a thin liquid layer called the outer core and then the solid iron inner core. The thickness of the crust changes. On land the average is between 30\u201350 kilometers thick. Under the oceans in some places it is only 6 kilometers thick.<ref>\"Tectonic plates. Shifting Sands\". Roberts, Paul. Harvard University Press. http.www.harvard.edu\/roberts\/shifting.

Due to plate tectonics the Earth's crust basically floats on the thick liquid rock of the mantle below. The crust is split up into parts called plates. These plates interact as they move about causing earthquakes and creating volcanoes and mountain ranges. The place where plates meet are called plate boundaries. There are three types of plate boundary: constructive, destructive and transform.<ref>Toshiro Tanimoto. \"Crustal of the Earth\". American Geophysical Union.

Over 70% of the Earth surface is covered by water. The underwater surface has many of the same features as the above sea with volcanoes, mountains and trenches or canyons. The 30% not covered by water is mostly forests, deserts plains, mountains and plateaus. Human civilization has led to increasing urbanisation \u2014 the growth of cities. Many things can change the surface of the Earth. Plate tectonics is main cause of change but there are others such as erosion from wind and rain, erosion by the oceans or meteorite impacts. There are three main types of rock that make up the Earth's surface: Igneous rock is made when magma or lava from the mantle reaches the surface and cools. As it gets colder it turns into rock or solidifies. Sedimentary rock is made from sediment, like sand or small bits of other rock, that has been crushed and packed tightly together. Metamorphic rock which is made when either of the other two types are changed by high or low temperatures and pressures.<ref>\"The Crust\". Alphonz, Edgar.

The Earth's atmosphere is made of about 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and small amounts of other gases. This mixture is often called air. Further up there is a layer of ozone gas called the Ozone layer. Ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. Ultraviolet radiation is dangerous to people, so without the Ozone layer life would not be possible. The atmosphere also protects the earth from crashes with meteors and small asteroids. This is because they burn up due to all the friction as they fly through it. It also helps to keep Earth warm. Some gases including carbon dioxide and methane act like a blanket around the Earth, they trap heat under them, keeping the Earth warm.<ref>\"NASA - Earth's atmosphere\".

As it rises it gets colder again and falls. This creates convection currents. When hot air meets cold air different weather effects happen. Convection currents are the cause of almost all weather on Earth. When it gets hot on the surface water evaporates and becomes steam or water vapour. This hot water vapour rises. As it rises it gets colder. When it gets cold enough it turns back into water again. This causes the clouds and rain. It is called the water cycle.<ref>\"What causes weather?\".

Actually, the Earth take 365.24 days to revolve around the sun. After every four years, an extra day is added, and the year has 366 days. This is a leap year. The Earth is, on average, 150 million kilometers away from the Sun, and moving at a speed of 30 kilometers a second or 108,000 miles an hour. The Moon orbits the Earth at an average distance of 250,000 miles. It is tidally locked to Earth, which means it always has the same side facing the Earth. It takes roughly one month to complete one orbit. The Earth is part of the Solar System and orbits the sun along with thousands of small objects and eight planets. The Sun, and therefore the Solar System, are currently traveling through the Orion Arm of the Milky Way Galaxy and will be for approximately the next 10,000 years.<ref>\"Earth's in the Milky Way\".

It has an outer, solid rock layer called the crust. Everything that lives on Earth is on top of the crust. Below that is a layer of thick, semi-liquid rock called the mantle. Under that is a thin liquid layer called the outer core and then the solid iron inner core. The thickness of the crust changes. On land the average is between 30\u201350 kilometers thick. Under the oceans in some places it is only 6 kilometers thick.<ref>\"Tectonic plates. Shifting Sands\". Roberts, Paul. Harvard University Press. http.www.harvard.edu\/roberts\/shifting.

Due to plate tectonics the Earth's crust basically floats on the thick liquid rock of the mantle below. The crust is split up into parts called plates. These plates interact as they move about causing earthquakes and creating volcanoes and mountain ranges. The place where plates meet are called plate boundaries. There are three types of plate boundary: constructive, destructive and transform.<ref>Toshiro Tanimoto. \"Crustal of the Earth\". American Geophysical Union. Retrieved 2009-08-02.<\/ref>\n\n== Surface ==\n[[File:Sunset in El Porto, California (8074300769).jpg|thumbnail]]\nThe Earth changes greatly from place to place. Over 70% of the Earth surface is covered by water. The underwater surface has many of the same features as the above sea with volcanoes, mountains and trenches or canyons. The 30% not covered by water is mostly forests, deserts plains, mountains and plateaus. Human civilization has led to increasing urbanisation \u2014 the growth of cities. Many things can change the surface of the Earth. Plate tectonics is main cause of change but there are others such as erosion from wind and rain, erosion by the oceans or meteorite impacts. There are three main types of rock that make up the Earth's surface: Igneous rock is made when magma or lava from the mantle reaches the surface and cools. As it gets colder it turns into rock or solidifies. Sedimentary rock is made from sediment, like sand or small bits of other rock, that has been crushed and packed tightly together. Metamorphic rock which is made when either of the other two types are changed by high or low temperatures and pressures.<ref>\"The Crust\". Alphonz, Edgar.

The Earth's atmosphere is made of about 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and small amounts of other gases. This mixture is often called air. Further up there is a layer of ozone gas called the Ozone layer. Ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. Ultraviolet radiation is dangerous to people, so without the Ozone layer life would not be possible. The atmosphere also protects the earth from crashes with meteors and small asteroids. This is because they burn up due to all the friction as they fly through it. It also helps to keep Earth warm. Some gases including carbon dioxide and methane act like a blanket around the Earth, they trap heat under them, keeping the Earth warm.<ref>\"NASA - Earth's atmosphere\".

As it rises it gets colder again and falls. This creates convection currents. When hot air meets cold air different weather effects happen. Convection currents are the cause of almost all weather on Earth. When it gets hot on the surface water evaporates and becomes steam or water vapour. This hot water vapour rises. As it rises it gets colder. When it gets cold enough it turns back into water again. This causes the clouds and rain. It is called the water cycle.<ref>\"What causes weather?\".

Actually, the Earth take 365.24 days to revolve around the sun. After every four years, an extra day is added, and the year has 366 days. This is a leap year. The Earth is, on average, 150 million kilometers away from the Sun, and moving at a speed of 30 kilometers a second or 108,000 miles an hour. The Moon orbits the Earth at an average distance of 250,000 miles. It is tidally locked to Earth, which means it always has the same side facing the Earth. It takes roughly one month to complete one orbit. The Earth is part of the Solar System and orbits the sun along with thousands of small objects and eight planets. The Sun, and therefore the Solar System, are currently traveling through the Orion Arm of the Milky Way Galaxy and will be for approximately the next 10,000 years.<ref>\"Earth's in the Milky Way\".

I suggest you take a little break from editing. You're making enemies, fast, and that is the last thing anyone needs. I suggest you read up on Wikipedia policy, and start by reading [[Wikipedia:Five pillars|the five pillars of Wikipedia]]. You should learn about the project you are writing for. Along those lines, you should also think about the project you are writing for. It is an encyclopedia, meaning you need to be able to write. In the past few days, you've made some edits that contained typos and other typographical errors, and sometimes even reverted them. Here is a quick list.\n\n#[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Template:Retired_Pacific_hurricanes&diff=prev&oldid=238276291 Just a few minutes ago] you changed a link from [[Typhoon Paka]] to [[Hurricane Paka]] - as a rule of thumbs, do not change the Wikilink unless the article title has been changed, and do not ever change the article title without discussion\n#[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Tropical_Storm_Julio_(2008)&curid=19007833&diff=238275001&oldid=237557508 A few minutes ago on Tropical Storm Julio] - you changed \"light\" to \"heavey\". It's spelled \"heavy\", but more importantly, the rainfall was actually quite light (just 1 inch).\n#[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Tropical_Storm_Erick_(2007)&diff=prev&oldid=238233360 This edit to Tropical Storm Erick] changed the section title from \"Effects\" to \"Imapct\" - it's spelled \"impact\".\nCheers. \u266c\u2669 [[User:Hurricanehink|Hurricanehink]] (<small>[[User_talk:Hurricanehink|talk]]<\/small>) 02:56, 14 September 2008 (UTC)\n\n== Redirecting your sandboxes ==\n\nWhen you're done with your sandboxes, you should request for their deletion by putting this template on the page - {{template|Db-g7}}. Simply redirecting them an existing article is bad, as there is no point for the redirect then. I suggest you do this for most, if not all of your sandboxes. \u266c\u2669 [[User:Hurricanehink|Hurricanehink]] (<small>[[User_talk:Hurricanehink|talk]]<\/small>) 14:48, 16 September 2008 (UTC)\n \n:If you want to talk about changing an established article ([[List of Pacific hurricanes], you should do so on its talk page. Second, no, [[Hurricane Flossie]] should not redirect to the 2007 storm, since it wasn't retired. Please read up the policy before doing such a change, as we have policy for a reason. \n\n:No, there is no need for any sub-article for [[Hurricane Kathleen]]. If you think the information is stubby, then you should add the information in. Just make sure the information is verifiable with a link. \n\n:Good luck working on Flossie, I guess. Just make sure you don't make the article any worse. If the storm history is already good enough (such as it has all of the needed information), then there's no need to change it.

First of all, please stop creating the new articles. None of them are needed, and none of them are any good. As I've said before, you are in the process of making enemies. I asked you before, but you ignored - have you gone through grade school writing and grammar? If so, please, write better the first around, and avoid the spelling and grammar mistakes. If not, then I suggest you avoid writing for a while, until you learn how to write. Regarding the Pacific hurricanes article, you must create a discussion to get people to agree with you. If no one agrees, or if no one knows about it, then you could been as disruptive. So, to recap, please stop making new articles, and please allow your old ones to be redirected. None of them are any good, and it just creates more work for other people to clean up. If you're looking for a storm that has a lot of info, why not try [[Hurricane Iris]]? I know it already exists, but it could give you the chance to work with a pretty significant storm, and one for which your efforts would not be wasted on. The key to making a good article is to find every piece of information available on the storm, and research very thoroughly. That means doing a Google search for \"Hurricane Iris\", using and citing every useful link you can find. Note, you'll have to cite, which means reading over [[WP:CITE]] and doing it correctly, or by using the formats established by other articles (check out [[Hurricane Lane (2006)]], which is featured). So recapping once more - please don't make any new articles, and instead work on [[Hurricane Iris]]. \u266c\u2669 [[User:Hurricanehink|Hurricanehink]] (<small>[[User_talk:Hurricanehink|talk]]<\/small>) 01:53, 20 September 2008 (UTC)\n\n== Your revision to [[2007 Pacific hurricane season#Tropical Storm Alvin]] ==\n\nHi Yellow Evan.

First of all, please stop creating the new articles. None of them are needed, and none of them are any good. [[Hurricane Max (2005)]], for example, is not at all needed; it is extremely short, and the overall writing is poor. As such, it should stay merged. As I've said before, you are in the process of making enemies. I asked you before, but you ignored - have you gone through grade school writing and grammar? If so, please, write better the first around, and avoid the spelling and grammar mistakes. If not, then I suggest you avoid writing for a while, until you learn how to write. Regarding the Pacific hurricanes article, you must create a discussion to get people to agree with you. If no one agrees, or if no one knows about it, then you could been as disruptive. So, to recap, please stop making new articles, and please allow your old ones to be redirected. None of them are any good, and it just creates more work for other people to clean up. If you're looking for a storm that has a lot of info, why not try [[Hurricane Iris]]? I know it already exists, but it could give you the chance to work with a pretty significant storm, and one for which your efforts would not be wasted on. The key to making a good article is to find every piece of information available on the storm, and research very thoroughly. That means doing a Google search for \"Hurricane Iris\", using and citing every useful link you can find. Note, you'll have to cite, which means reading over [[WP:CITE]] and doing it correctly, or by using the formats established by other articles (check out [[Hurricane Lane (2006)]], which is featured). So recapping once more - please don't make any new articles, and instead work on [[Hurricane Iris]]. \u266c\u2669 [[User:Hurricanehink|Hurricanehink]] (<small>[[User_talk:Hurricanehink|talk]]<\/small>) 02:56, 20 September 2008 (UTC)\n\n:Please respond as soon as you read this. \u266c\u2669 [[User:Hurricanehink|Hurricanehink]] (<small>[[User_talk:Hurricanehink|talk]]<\/small>) 03:09, 20 September 2008 (UTC)\n\n::I'm only trying to help you out. First of all, Max isn't that notable for absorbing Linda, and even if it was, you cannot have an article that short and stubby. This may be a free encyclopedia, but you need to realize you don't [[WP:OWN|own]] your articles. Hilary, Max, and Otis are all unneeded, although Otis is the most notable out of the three (which is why it hasn't been merged yet). I strongly suggest you stop making any new articles, since nearly all of them have been merged by various project members, simply because all of them are poor, unneeded articles. Regarding that list of articles you think should be made, I don't think any of them need articles at the moment. Personally, I think the best thing for you would be to improve an existing article, which is why I suggested [[Hurricane Iris]]. The storm has a ton of information available, but the article is rather poor. I'm telling you this because I don't want you to leave the project. I want you to be useful, and I believe you can be in the future. But right now, you are creating more work than what it is necessary, by making the new articles. I hope you read and understand what I am saying. I am willing to help, but I can't do 100%. I hope you take faith in what I am saying. I have been here for over three years, and I know my way around the place.

Creating new stub storm articles that contain no more information than already exists within the season articles, does not help.  Just because a topic (storm) is notable does not mean we need a stub article on it if the information can be presented better in a list (seasonal) format.  Take some time to work on improving your writing and researching skills by working on existing articles to improve them.  Talk to experienced editors for guidance, and consider their advice seriously; joining the IRC channel can help speed this up. \u2014 [[User:Jdorje|jdorje]] <small>([[User_talk:jdorje|talk]])<\/small> 03:35, 20 September 2008 (UTC)\n\nYellow Evan, I'm telling you, it doesn't matter how much you try fixing articles up. You cannot write good articles, and stubs like [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hurricane_Hillary_(2005) this] are polluting the project by creating more work. As an aside, Boris and the Mazatlan hurricane still exist only because other editors worked on them. Fausto is far from good, as it is merely a copy of the tropical cyclone report. And so I'll say it once again - it doesn't matter how much you try fixing your articles up. You are fighting a losing argument by trying to keep [[Hurricane Hillary (2005)]] (which is misspelled, BTW). Fausto could be on the way to being merged, as well. PLEASE stop making the new articles. Instead, as Jdorje said, take some time to work on improving your writing and researching skills by working on existing articles to improve them. \n\nNow, I have a question for you. Would you be opposed to talking with the rest of the WPTC editors online? We have sort of a chatroom on [[Internet Relay Chat]], but it's reserved to only WPTC members, and so I am formally inviting you to join. You just have to click on [http:\/\/www.mibbit.com\/ this link]; when it says \"Connect to IRC:\" click on the dropbox and change it to '''freenode.net''' (it's pretty far down the list). Then, under Nick: put your name, and under Channel(s): put '''#wiki-hurricanes'''.

I see you plan on making ''Meteorological history of Hurricane Guillermo (1997)'', and I can assure you that will be redirected as soon as it is published.

For why you should, consider this analogy: Which would you rather have, (1) twenty leaky drafty houses that are in ruins and that you built yourself? Or (2) one other house that while not a mansion or created by you at least keeps you warm and dry? I would take the second choice and I know you and everyone would take the second choice. Change houses to articles and you will see why you shouldn't keep creating articles the way you are. By learning the ropes on an existing article you will eventually be able to make houses rather than rubble. And if this dispute escalates further, it may eventually get to [[WP:RfC|Requests for comment]]. Trust me, you don't want to go there. I would never send my worst enemy there.

It moved westward without any deep convection. It continued through the Caribbean and crossed Central America on [[July 1]] and entered the Eastern pacific Ocean shortly thereafter. The wave turned north as it began to organize. Finally on [[July 3]] the [[National Hurricane Center|NHC]] classified the wave as Tropical Depression Four-E and [[Tropical Cyclone Watches and Warnings]] were issued.\n\nUpon becoming a tropical cyclone, land was in the way which could have weakened the cyclone. Instead, It became better organized and  \nwas upgraded to [[Tropical Storm Dora]] six hours later. Shortly thereafter, Dora reached a peak of 45 mph.\n\nTwelve hors after its peak, it became a 40 mph Tropical Storm while effecting Mexican States like [[Guerrero]]. On [[July 6]] Dora made it closest approach to Mexico, coming within 45 miles. Later that day, It regained peak intensity later that day, but it was downgraded to a 35 mph tropical depression and all warnings and watches were discontinued. It dissipated on [[July 6]].\n\n===Impact===\nDora brought heavy rains washing out roadways, but no damage was reported.\n\nMany watches and warnings were issued from [[Acapulco]] to [[La Fortuna]].\nOn [[July 4]]A 45 mph wind report from ship H9UY (Nikkei Phoenix) located 20 miles east of the center was useful in determining the peak intensity of Dora. A 35 mph wind report on July 2 from ship 4XFQ located 35 miles southeast of the center was helpful in\nestimating the extent of tropical storm-force winds.\n\nAfter Dora began to interact with the mountainous terrain of coastal Mexico on July 5,\nsatellite-based automated objective Dvorak T-numbers from the University of Wisconsin\u2019s\nCooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (UW-CIMSS) produced overestimated\nintensity values of 40-50 kt. These inflated values were likely due to enhanced convective development\ncaused by the southerly upslope flow on the east side of Dora.\n\n{{2005 Pacific hurricane season buttons}}\n\n{{TC Decades|Year=2000|basin=Pacific|type=hurricane}}\n\n== SEason ==\n\nI help too.

The ninth named storm, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the [[2008 Atlantic hurricane season|2008 season]], Ike developed on [[September 1]] in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. Maintaining a generally westward track throughout its duration, Ike reached Category&nbsp;4 status on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Saffir-Simpson scale]], moving across the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] at that intensity before weakening and crossing [[Cuba]]; heavy damage was reported in Cuba, which was still recovering from [[Hurricane Gustav]] just weeks prior. Gustav later moved across the Gulf of Mexico and struck near [[Galveston, Texas]], where its effects were estimated as the costliest hurricane in Texas history. Further inland, the storm brought high winds and widespread damage, and its impact reached as far as Canada. Throughout its path, Gustav caused over 100&nbsp;deaths, mostly in Texas and [[Haiti]], and several hundred remain missing.\n<\/div>\n{{Wikipedia:WikiProject Tropical cyclones\/Newsletter\/box-header}}\n'''Other tropical cyclone activity'''<br\/>\n* [[2008 Atlantic hurricane season|Atlantic Ocean]]&ndash; In addition to Ike, two hurricanes from the previous month, [[Hurricane Gustav|Gustav]] and [[Hurricane Hanna (2008)|Hanna]], lasted into September, both striking the United States. [[Tropical Storm Josephine (2008)|Tropical Storm Josephine]] formed while Ike and Hanna were active; it remained away from land and dissipated four days after forming. The tropics were quiet in the Atlantic for about 10&nbsp;days after Ike dissipated, until [[Hurricane Kyle (2008)|Hurricane Kyle]] formed north of [[Hispaniola]]; its precursor brought heavy rains to the [[Greater Antilles]], and Kyle ultimately became extratropical as it moved into [[Atlantic Canada]]. At the end of the month, [[Tropical Storm Laura (2008)|Tropical Storm Laura]] formed from a [[subtropical cyclone]] far away from land; it persisted until early October, when it lost tropical characteristics to the southeast of [[Newfoundland]].\n* [[2008 Pacific hurricane season|Eastern Pacific Ocean]]&ndash; The month in the eastern Pacific Ocean was the quietest on record, in terms of [[Accumulated Cyclone Energy|ACE]] index. Early in the month, Tropical Storm Karina lasted for two days without affecting land. A few days later, [[Tropical Storm Lowell (2008)|Tropical Storm Lowell]] formed and later affected the [[Baja California peninsula]] and mainland Mexico as a tropical depression; its remnants merged with the remnants of Ike.\n* [[2008 Pacific hurricane season|Western Pacific Ocean]]&ndash; Five named storms developed in the western Pacific, beginning with [[Typhoon Sinlaku (2008)|Typhoon Sinlaku]] which became a powerful cyclone before weakening and bringing heavy rainfall to [[Taiwan]]; there, it caused 11&nbsp;deaths and heavy damage, and it later affected [[Japan]]. The second storm of the month was [[Typhoon Hagupit (2008)|Typhoon Hagupit]], which caused $1&nbsp;billion (USD) in damage and 68&nbsp;deaths when it struck China. [[Typhoon Jangmi (2008)|Typhoon Jangmi]] was next, which brought further damage and deaths to Taiwan. Two more tropical storms developed during the month; Mekkhala formed in the [[South China Sea]] and caused heavy damage in [[Vietnam]], while Higos moved across the [[Philippines]] and later struck [[China]].\n* [[2008 North Indian Ocean cyclone season|North Indian Ocean]]&ndash; One deep depression formed during the month, which moved ashore in the [[India]]n province of [[Orissa]]; it caused 25&nbsp;deaths from heavy rainfall.\n<\/div>\n{{Wikipedia:WikiProject Tropical cyclones\/Newsletter\/box-header}}\n'''Member of the month'''   \n[[Image:Cyclone barnstar.png|left|Cyclone barnstar|50px]]\nThe September member of the month is [[User:CrazyC83|CrazyC83]], who has been a steady editor within the project for the past few years.

While many of the selected articles are of featured or good quality, several require substantial cleanup and expansion. \n\nIn other news, a handful of changes to project standards have taken place. Per a consensus on [[WT:WPTC|the project's talk page]], the section of each tropical cyclone article previously entitled \"Storm history\" has been changed to \"Meteorological history\", thanks in part to [[User:Plasticup|Plasticup]]'s bot which preformed the hundreds of edits to execute the change.

Several motorists and passengers are wounded or killed on the nearby freeway. When the police respond and start to close in on him, he flees and takes refuge in a [[Reseda, Los Angeles|Reseda]] [[drive-in theater]] where aging horror film icon Byron Orlok ([[Boris Karloff]]) is about to make a final in-person promotional appearance before retiring from show business. Thompson, perched on the framing inside the screen tower, resumes his killing spree after sunset, randomly shooting theater patrons as they sit in their cars watching the film. In a climactic confrontation, the elderly Orlok slaps the murderer into submission. As the police take him away Thompson remarks with apparent satisfaction that he \"hardly ever missed\".\n\n==Production==\nThe character and actions of the killer are patterned after [[Charles Whitman]], the University of Texas sniper. The character of Byron Orlok, named after [[Max Schreck]]'s vampire Count Orlok in 1922's ''[[Nosferatu]]'', was based on Karloff himself, with a fictional component of being embittered with the movie business and wanting to retire. The role was Karloff's last appearance in a major American film.\n\nIn the film's finale at a drive-in theater, Orlok&nbsp;&ndash; the old-fashioned, traditional screen monster who always obeyed the rules&nbsp;&ndash; confronts the new, realistic, nihilistic late-1960s \"monster\" in the shape of a clean-cut, unassuming multiple murderer.\n\nBogdanovich got the chance to make ''Targets'' because [[Boris Karloff]] owed studio head [[Roger Corman]] two days' work. Corman told Bogdanovich he could make any film he liked provided he used Karloff and stayed under budget. In addition, Bogdanovich had to use clips from Corman's Napoleonic-era thriller ''[[The Terror (1963 film)|The Terror]]'' in the movie.  The clips from ''The Terror'' feature [[Jack Nicholson]] and Boris Karloff.  Bogdanovich has said that [[Samuel Fuller]] provided generous help on the screenplay and refused to accept either a fee or a screen credit, so Bogdanovich named his own character Sammy Michaels (Fuller's middle name was Michael) in tribute.  Fuller advised Bogdanovich to save as much money in the film's budget as possible for the film to have an action-packed conclusion.<ref>Background and production information in accordance with the extensive audio commentary by Bogdanovich available on the MGM DVD release of the film.<\/ref>\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Tim O'Kelly]] as Bobby Thompson\n*[[Boris Karloff]] as Byron Orlok\n*[[Arthur Peterson]] as Ed Loughlin\n*[[Monte Landis]] as Marshall Smith\n*[[Nancy Hsueh]] as Jenny\n*[[Peter Bogdanovich]] as Sammy Michaels\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=June 2015}}\n[[American International Pictures]] offered to release but Bogdanovich wanted to try and see if the film could get a deal with a major studio. It was seen by Robert Evans of Paramount who bought it for $150,000, giving Corman an instant profit on the movie before it was even released.<ref>Andrew Yule, ''Picture Shows: The Life and Films of Peter Bogdanovich'', Limelight, 1992 p 32<\/ref>\n\nAlthough the film was written and production photography completed in late 1967, it was released after the assassinations of [[Martin Luther King]] and [[Robert F. Kennedy]] in early 1968 and thus had some topical relevance to then-current events. Nevertheless, it was not very successful at the box office.\n\nHowever, Bogdanovich, who appears in the film as a young writer-director, credits it with getting him noticed by the studios, which in turn led to his directing three very successful studio films (''[[The Last Picture Show]]'', ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc]]'', and ''[[Paper Moon (film)|Paper Moon]]'') in the early 1970s.\n\nThe movie is currently included as one of ''[[1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die]]''. ''Targets'' currently holds an 88% \"fresh\" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 25 reviews.\n\n==In popular culture==\n* The [[Elvis Costello]] song \"Big Tears,\" released on his 1978 album ''[[This Year's Model]]'', is said by Costello himself to refer to this film.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of American films of 1968]]\n*[[Charles Whitman]]\n*[[1965 Highway 101 sniper attack]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n*{{IMDb title|id=0063671|title=Targets}}\n* {{Amg movie|48670|Targets}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|targets|Targets}}\n* [http:\/\/www.culturecourt.com\/F\/Hollywood\/Targets.htm Review at culturecourt.com]\n\n{{Peter Bogdanovich}}\n\n[[Category:1968 films]]\n[[Category:1960s crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:American crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American horror films]]\n[[Category:Directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about actors]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Peter Bogdanovich]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles, California]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Screenplays by Peter Bogdanovich]]\n[[Category:Serial killer films]]\n[[Category:Films about snipers]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Roger Corman]]","timestamp":"20160410102755","user-timestamp":"20150410102755"},{"title":"User talk:Igotadeskjob","content":"\n==Speedy deletion of [[:I Got a Desk Job]]==\n[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|48px|left]] A tag has been placed on [[:I Got a Desk Job]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia.

Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]], as well as our subject-specific [[Wikipedia:Notability (music)|notability guideline for musical topics]]. \n\nIf you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding <code>{{tl|hangon}}<\/code> to '''the top of [[:Malachi lewis|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion or \"db\" tag), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Malachi lewis|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

Built in 1902 by [[Chantiers de Penho\u00ebt]] in [[St. Nazaire]], [[France]], as '''''La\u00ebnnec''''', the ship served two French owners before she was sold to [[Germany|German]] interest in 1922 and renamed '''''Oldenburg'''''. In 1930, she was acquired by the Government of [[Finland]], refitted to serve as a [[school ship]] for the [[Finnish Navy]] and given her current name. ''Suomen Joutsen'' made eight long international voyages before the [[Second World War]] and later served in various support and supply roles during the war. From 1961 on she served as a stationary seamen's school for the [[Finnish Merchant Navy]]. In 1991, ''Suomen Joutsen'' was donated to the city of [[Turku]] and became a museum ship moored next to [[Forum Marinum]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== ''La\u00ebnnec'' (1902\u20131922) ===\n\nIn 1902, the French shipping company [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme des Armateurs Nantais]] ordered two 3,100-ton full rigged ships from [[Chantiers de Penho\u00ebt]] in [[Saint-Nazaire]]. The first ship, launched on 7 August 1902, was christened ''La\u00ebnnec'' after [[Ren\u00e9 Laennec]], a French doctor and inventor of the [[stethoscope]]. On 18 September 1902 she was followed by the second ship, named ''[[Haudaudine]]'' after [[Pierre Haudaudine]], which was lost off the coast of [[New Caledonia]] on 3 January 1905.<ref name=\"haudaudine\">[http:\/\/www.paperspast.natlib.govt.nz\/cgi-bin\/paperspast?a=d&d=TC19050105.2.12.4&e=-------10--1----2%22james+temple+fisher%22-- Shipwreck]. Colonist, 5 January 1905. {{retrieved | accessdate=2012-03-10}}<\/ref> On 23 October 1902 ''La\u00ebnnec'' left Saint-Nazaire and headed to [[Cardiff]], [[England]], to load coal bound for [[Iquique]], [[Chile]].<ref name=\"laennec1\">Auvinen (2002), pages 9\u201314.<\/ref><ref name=\"laennec2\">Aalste et al. (1989), pages 10\u201311.<\/ref>\n\n''La\u00ebnnec'' was almost sunk on her maiden voyage when she collided with an English [[steam ship]] [[SS Penzance|''Penzance'']] in the [[Bay of Biscay]], sinking the fully laden steamer within minutes. ''La\u00ebnnec'', also seriously damaged, was towed to [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]] for repairs. One of the reasons for the incident was that she was not carrying enough [[sailing ballast]] on her voyage from the shipyard, and as a result her rudder was not completely submerged in water, significantly reducing the maneuverability of the ship. Towards the end of the nine-month voyage, while carrying [[potassium nitrate]] from Chile to [[Bremerhaven]], [[Germany]], a minor [[mutiny]] broke out when four crew members disobeyed orders from Captain Turb\u00e9.<ref name=\"laennec1\" \/>\n\nIn 1906<ref name=\"note1\" group=\"note\">1920 according to some sources.<\/ref> ''La\u00ebnnec'' was sold to a French shipping company [[Compagnie Plisson]]. She made several voyages across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and around [[Kap Horn]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]], and around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] to [[Australia]] under the command of Captain [[Achille Guriec]]. On her way back to Europe she carried wheat or potassium nitrate.<ref name=\"laennec1\" \/>\n\nOn 12 December 1911, while unloading potassium nitrate at the port of [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]], [[Spain]], ''La\u00ebnnec'' was severely damaged when a storm pushed her against the pier and ripped the ship from her moorings, causing the full rigged ship to drift against a Dutch steam ship [[SS Rhehania|''Rhehania'']]. As there was no shipyard large enough to accommodate ''La\u00ebnnec'' in Santander, the ship was emptied and inclined until her damaged hull plating was exposed and could be repaired within the harbour. The repairs took 20 days and the ship, which by that time had become a popular attraction for the local people, left Spain on 1 February 1912.<ref name=\"laennec1\" \/> In 1914 the [[main mast]] of ''La\u00ebnnec'' broke off and fell over the starboard side when the ship was struck by a heavy storm in the [[North Atlantic Ocean]]. She was towed to [[Brest, France|Brest]] for repairs.<ref name=\"laennec2\" \/> On 12 June 1916 Captain Guriec died onboard ''La\u00ebnnec'' while the ship was passing the Cape of Good Hope on her way back to Europe. The command was assumed by the [[first mate]] who, according to some sources, also perished before the ship arrived in England. Later the command was given to Captain [[\u00c9mile Delano\u00eb]].<ref name=\"laennec1\" \/>\n\nWhen the [[First World War]] broke out, ''La\u00ebnnec'' was equipped with two deck guns. Due to the presence of German [[U-boat]]s in Europe, the ship spent the war years trading in the United States East Coast. After the war, she arrived back to her home port, Saint-Nazaire, after a 150-day voyage from Australia to be stripped and laid up. On 1 December 1920 ''La\u00ebnnec'' was put for sale.<ref name=\"laennec1\" \/>\n\n=== ''Oldenburg'' (1922\u20131930) ===\n[[File:Oldenburg Troense.jpg|thumb|left|''Oldenburg'', the school ship of the German merchant navy.]]\nIn late November 1922, after having been laid up for two years, ''La\u00ebnnec'' was sold to a German shipping company [[H. H. Schmidt & Co.]] from [[Hamburg]]. After refitting she was renamed ''Oldenburg'' after the city of [[Oldenburg]] and, through an agreement with the German school ship association [[Deutscher Schulschiffverein]], she became a school ship for the German merchant navy.<ref name=\"oldenburg1\">Auvinen (2002), pages 15\u201317.<\/ref> Among the men who received their training onboard ''Oldenburg'' over the years was the German U-boat ace [[G\u00fcnther Prien]].\n\nIn 1925, while rounding Kap Horn, ''Oldenburg'' lost her main mast in a storm and had to seek shelter due to damaged rigging. After emergency repairs in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], she crossed the Atlantic and headed back to Hamburg. However, due to strong easterly winds she was forced to pass the [[British Isles]] on the northern side instead of the [[English Channel]]. 78 days after leaving the [[R\u00edo de la Plata]] estuary, ''Oldenburg'' was taken into tow by a German tugboat and towed to Hamburg.<ref name=\"oldenburg1\" \/>\n\nIn 1928 ''Oldenburg'' was sold to another German shipping company, [[Seefart Segelschiffs-Reederei GmbH]] from [[Bremen]]. In 1930, on her last voyage under the German flag, ''Oldenburg'' was almost lost when the cargo of [[phosphate]] shifted in heavy weather. After two weeks in a heavy storm, the longitudinal bulkhead gave way and the ship assumed a list of 55 degrees. Lifeboats, spare [[yard (sailing)|yards]] and the kitchen stove were lost overboard. However, the crew managed to righten the ship and sail her to [[Malm\u00f6]], [[Sweden]]. After unloading the ship was moved to Bremerhaven to be laid up.<ref name=\"oldenburg1\" \/>\n\n=== ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' (1930\u2013) ===\n\n==== Acquisition and refitting ====\n\n[[File:Suomen Joutsen in Uusikaupunki.jpg|thumb|left|''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' during outfitting in Uusikaupunki, with ''Osmo'' in the foreground]]\n\nAlthough the school ship was left out from the [[Finnish Naval Act of 1927]], the Finnish Navy decided to keep looking for a suitable vessel and purchase it separately from the major fleet renewal program. Over the years, opinions both in favor and against a school ship had been presented, but it was generally agreed that such vessel would be in many ways beneficial for the Finnish Navy. Initially there was also disagreement about the type of the ship \u2014 some were in favor of a modern steam ship that could be used in the local waters while the others preferred a traditional sailing ship that would teach the cadets traditional seaman skills and bring them closer to [[merchant mariner]]s. The latter was also recommended by foreign naval officials, and finally the Finnish Navy agreed on a sailing ship. This was further helped by the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] that had brought the prices down, and the fact that windjammers had been largely replaced by steam ships.<ref name=\"aalste9\" \/>\n\nIn April 1930, the [[Parliament of Finland]] allotted 4,000,000 [[Finnish markka]]s for procuring a second-hand full rigged ship and refitting it as a school ship for the Finnish Navy. During the summer of 1930, the Finnish officials inspected a number of Finnish and foreign ships that were offered for sale. These included [[Gustav Erikson]]'s four-masted [[barque]]s [[Pommern (ship)|''Pommern'']] and ''[[Herzogin Cecilie]]'', and several other ships, but all were deemed either too large or too dilapidated. In the end, the most suitable candidate came from Germany where ''Oldenburg'', a 28-year-old former school ship of the German merchant navy, was offered for sale.<ref name=\"aalste9\">Aalste et al. (1989), page 9.<\/ref> After inspecting the ship in Bremen, the Finnish officials purchased her in August 1930 and the German crew sailed the ship to Helsinki.<ref name=\"laennec2\" \/><ref name=\"auvinen18-19\">Auvinen (2002), pages 18\u201319.<\/ref>\n\nAfter having been handed over to the Finnish Navy, ''Oldenburg'' was towed to [[Uusikaupunki]] for refitting. The work, which began in late 1930 and continued until November 1931, included replacing part of the bottom plating, building an additional tweendeck, refurbishing the rigging, painting the whole ship and rebuilding her cargo holds to accommodate up to 180 men. The shipyard was responsible for the structural alterations while 62 future crew members and cadets of the Finnish Navy were responsible for the other tasks, including carrying 1,200 tons of stones to the ship as sailing ballast.<ref name=\"tekn1\" \/>\n\nOn 1 November 1931, after a number of delays, ''Oldenburg'' was renamed ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' (Swan of Finland) after ''[[Finska Svan]]'', a Swedish 16th century warship that took part in the [[Action of 7 July 1565|naval action of 7{{nbsp}}July{{nbsp}}1565]] between Sweden and Denmark. After launching, ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' broke her moorings in the strong breeze and damaged two ships, gunboat [[Finnish gunboat Karjala|''Karjala'']] and ''Osmo'', a laid-up full rigged ship built in 1869, before she was brought under control. On 4 November 1931, she left the shipyard for Helsinki, under tow and escorted by minelayer [[Finnish minelayer Louhi|''M-1'']].<ref name=\"aalste18\">Aalste et al.

Captain [[Arvo Lieto]] proposed postponing the departure until the next autumn as Christmas was drawing near and the sea was already freezing, but on 21 December 1931 [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud|President P. E. Svinhufvud]] ordered the ship to begin her first international school sailing under the Finnish flag. ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' was towed to the sea on the following day, but she had to wait for favourable winds outside [[Porkkala]] until 28 December, at which point she had already been grounded once. The streak of bad luck continued when the ship was anchored in [[Trongisv\u00e1gsfj\u00f8r\u00f0ur]] in [[Su\u00f0uroy]], [[Faroe Islands]], after stopping to purchase more lubrication oil at [[Trongisv\u00e1gur]]. ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' dragged her anchors in a storm measuring 11\u201312 on the [[Beaufort scale]], drifting stern first towards the shore. After two trawlers and a tugboat managed to get the full rigged ship safely to the harbour, it was found out that the rudder had been damaged and the ship was towed to England for drydocking. After repairs, ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' continued to the [[Canary Islands]], where she remained for three weeks while Captain Lieto was relieved of command and replaced by [[John Konkola]], who served as the captain of the school ship for six full and two partial voyages. From the Canary Islands, ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' headed south, but the refrigeration system failed {{convert|500|km}} before the [[Equator]] and she had to turn back before a [[line-crossing ceremony]] could be held. However, the crew got some consolation when news about the end of [[prohibition in Finland]] reached the ship while she was sailing towards Finland in the Baltic Sea. ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' arrived in Finland on 22 May 1932 and was drydocked at [[Suomenlinna]] shortly thereafter.<ref name=\"first\">Aalste et al. (1989), pages 27\u201333.<\/ref>\n\nThe second voyage of ''Suomen Joutsen'' began on 18 October 1932, and after stopping briefly in the Canady Islands and [[Cape Verde]], she crossed the Equator on 11 December for the first time flying the Finnish flag. On 24 December, the crew celebrated traditional Finnish Christmas outside [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], and arrived at the port on the following morning. The visit of \"Cisne Blanco de Finlandia\", the white swan of Finland, was widely covered in local newspapers. From Rio de Janeiro, ''Suomen Joutsen'' continued her voyage to [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], and then, against her original sailing plan, to [[Buenos Aires]]. After leaving [[Argentine]] and visiting a number of ports in the Caribbean, ''Suomen Joutsen'' crossed the Atlantic and finally arrived in Finland on 3 May 1933. On the way back, her crew caught a number of [[sea turtles]] for the [[Helsinki Zoo]].<ref name=\"second\">Aalste et al.

While heading towards [[Gibraltar]] on her way to the Atlantic, an English steam ship tauntingly offered to tow the Finnish full rigged ship which was sailing slowly [[points of sail|close to the wind]]. However, shortly afterwards the wind changed its direction and ''Suomen Joutsen'' overtook the steamer with a towing line hanging from the stern [[hawsehole]], offering to provide assistance for the slower ship. After stopping briefly at the Canary Islands, the ship crossed the Atlantic and arrived in Haiti on 10 March 1934 after 25 days of sailing. The return voyage began six days later. On 6 April, while in the middle of the Northern Atlantic, ''Suomen Joutsen'' was hit by hurricane-force winds that caused the ship to list almost 56 degrees. She survived the worst storm of her career without major damage and arrived in Helsinki on 16 May 1934.<ref name=\"third\">Aalste et al.

While sailing towards the [[Greece|Greek]] port city of [[Piraeus]] outside [[Sardinia]] on 7 December, she was overtaken by the Italian 51,000-ton [[ocean liner]] [[SS Rex|SS ''Rex'']] which passed ''Suomen Joutsen'' at full speed of {{convert|31|kn}} from a distance of only {{convert|50|m|yd|abbr=off}}. Although the holder of the [[Blue Riband]] was a sight to behold, seeing a full rigged ship underway in the open seas was also becoming a rare treat. After visiting various ports in the Mediterranean, the ship returned to the Atlantic and stopped briefly at Ponta Delgada, but crossed neither the Atlantic nor the Equator. ''Suomen Joutsen'' returned to Helsinki on 3 May 1935.<ref name=\"fourth\">Aalste et al. (1989), pages 47\u201351.<\/ref><ref name=\"fourth2\">Auvinen (2002), page 101.<\/ref>\n\nThe fifth voyage of ''Suomen Joutsen'' was the longest the ship had ever done under the Finnish flag. After leaving Helsinki on 9 October 1935, the ship stopped briefly at [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], and then continued across the Atlantic, eventually arriving in the [[Panama canal]] on 26 December. It took eleven and a half hours to transit the {{convert|81|km|mi|adj=on}} canal. After leaving Panama behind, ''Suomen Joutsen'' headed south and crossed the Equator on 4 January 1936 with appropriate ceremonies. Later the ship stopped at [[Callao]] in [[Peru]] and [[Valparaiso]] in [[Chile]], where five men escaped after a local barkeeper had offered them full upkeep for playing at his bar. The men were later caught by local officials and returned to Finland, where they were sentenced for six months in prison. After leaving Chile, ''Suomen Joutsen'' sailed around the [[Cape Horn]] without major difficulties and arrived in Buenos Aires on 21 March. From Argentine, the ship continued to Rio de Janeiro, where she encountered the Brazilian school ship ''[[Almirante Saldanha]]'', whose purchase had been inspired by the previous visit of the white swan of Finland. ''Suomen Joutsen'' sailed out on 14 April and due to heavy weather and headwinds, it took seven weeks to reach the Azores. On 9 May, Captain Konkola turned 50 and after the crew had sung \"[[Happy Birthday to You]]\" at 6:30 in the morning, he stuck his head out from the cabin door and yelled \"Steward, give them [[Distilled beverage|booze]]!\" ''Suomen Joutsen'' arrived in Helsinki on 4 July 1936. After a number of disagreements regarding the use of tugboats in the foreign ports, Captain Konkola decided to sail the full rigged ship all the way to the harbour, crossing the narrow [[Kustaanmiekka|Kustaanmiekka strait]] at full sail. Finally, when the bow had already been moored at [[Katajanokka]], he allowed the tugboat to push the stern against the pier and the fifth voyage was over.<ref name=\"fifth\">Aalste et al. (1989), pp. 55\u201365.<\/ref>\n\nOn her sixth voyage, the most important stop of ''Suomen Joutsen'' was [[New York]], where the ship arrived on 3 March 1937. Prior to this, the ship had visited Portugal, [[Senegal]] and a number of ports in the Caribbean after leaving Helsinki on 2 November 1936. However, the ship's first and only visit to the [[United States]] under the Finnish flag was an important milestone and a major media event. When the ship was sailing up the [[Hudson River]], an American film crew came on board to capture her arrival, and ''Suomen Joutsen'' remained the center of attention for the six days she was moored at the western end of the [[35th Street (Manhattan)|35th Street]]. When the ship left New York, a member of the crew was accidentally left on the shore. However, he managed to talk a local tugboat captain to take him back to the school ship and, for solving the problem on his own initiative, was left without punishment. After stopping at [[Oslo]], ''Suomen Joutsen'' arrived in Helsinki on the [[May Day]] of 1936. Among the first people to leave the ship was a man carrying a living [[crocodile]] under his arm, captured for the Helsinki Zoo.<ref name=\"seventh\">Aalste et al. (1989), pp. 66\u201376.<\/ref>\n\nThe seventh voyage of ''Suomen Joutsen'' began on 20 October 1937 and took the ship first across the Atlantic to South America. After calling Montevideo, she continued east to [[Cape Town]], stopping at [[Tristan da Cunha]] along the way. The seventh voyage has often been called the unluckiest one as three crew members were lost before the ship arrived back in Finland on 12 May 1938. On 7 February, a seaman fell from the bow mast and was buried at sea on the following day. On the way to Cape Town, a sergeant became ill and later died in a hospital in [[South Africa]] on 10 March. On 10 May, a member of the regular crew fell to the sea while painting the hull when the ship was underway in the Baltic Sea. Many thought that the deaths were due to the crew killing three [[albatross]]es earlier in the voyage. Finally, when ''Suomen Joutsen'' was outside Helsinki, a small airplane flew too close to the ship and crashed into the sea, but the pilots were rescued.<ref name=\"seventh2\">Aalste et al. (1989), pages 77\u201383<\/ref><ref>Auvinen (2002), pp. 221\u2013223.<\/ref>\n\n''Suomen Joutsen'' left for her eighth and last international voyage on 27 October 1938. After stopping at Copenhagen for provisions and clearing the English Channel \u2014 and almost colliding with the Polish passenger ship [[MS Pi\u0142sudski|''Pi\u0142sudski'']] \u2014 she continued to the [[Bay of Biscay]]. However, {{convert|15|m|ft|adj=on}} waves forced ''Suomen Joutsen'' to turn back on 23 November and head to [[Bordeaux]] to wait for the weather to clear. Captain Konkola, concerned about his ailing health, was relieved of his duty and replaced by [[Unto Voionmaa]] on 3 December 1938. Under his command, ''Suomen Joutsen'' crossed the Atlantic twice, calling the ports of [[Pernambuco]] in Brazil and [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] in [[Puerto Rico]]. On her last stop at [[Rotterdam]], there were already signs of a [[World War II|major conflict]] in the air, and had the war started before the ship arrived in Finland, she would have headed to the United Kingdom. ''Suomen Joutsen'' arrived in Helsinki on 22 April 1939, after which she never left the Baltic Sea again.<ref name=\"eight\">Aalste et al.

She was used as a [[submarine tender|supply ship]] for the Finnish submarine fleet within the Finnish archipelago. When the [[Winter War]] broke out on 30 November 1939, she was stationed in [[H\u00f6gs\u00e5ra]] with the submarines and [[coastal defence ship]]s [[Finnish coastal defence ship V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen|''V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen'']] and [[Finnish coastal defence ship Ilmarinen|''Ilmarinen'']]. After three [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] scout planes flew over the ships, the fleet moved hastily to another safe location near [[Nauvo]] only hours before eight four-engined enemy bombers overflew the previous anchorage. During the first weeks of the war, ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' was assigned to \"moving supply depot\" under the [[Archipelago Sea Fleet]] that consisted of the full rigged ship and a number of barges and tugboats. She served in this task until the Winter War ended with the signing of the [[Moscow Peace Treaty]] on 13 March 1940. During the [[Interim Peace]] she was stationed in [[Naantali]].<ref name=\"auvinen273-276\">Auvinen (2002), pp. 273\u2013276.<\/ref>\n\nWhen the [[Continuation War]] started on 25 June 1941, ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' resumed her old tasks as a moving supply depot under the Archipelago Sea Fleet. Since the Finnish Navy now had a dedicated submarine tender, [[Finnish icebreaker Sisu (1939)|icebreaker ''Sisu'']], the former school ship was relegated to supply [[motor torpedo boat]]s. After the war ended on 19 September 1944, ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' was used as an accommodation ship in Turku.<ref name=\"auvinen273-276\" \/>\n\nDuring the war, around 150 men were stationed on ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen''. The ship was lightly armed with only two machine guns and around 40 rifles.<ref name=\"auvinen273-276\" \/> She survived the war largely intact, with only minor [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] damage from Soviet air raids.<ref>Aalste et al. (1989), p. 91.<\/ref>\n{{-}}\n\n==== After the war (1945\u20131961) ====\n[[File:Suomen Joutsen 1950s.jpg|thumb|left|''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' in the 1950s.]]\n\nAfter the war, ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' participated in the demining of the Finnish coastal waters, for which purpose she was fitted with an engine repair shop and a sauna for the crews of the [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]]. She served in this task until the mine clearance was finished in 1948, but was afterwards used as an accommodation and supply ship for different branches of the Finnish Navy. In 1955\u20131959 she was stationed in [[Upinniemi]].<ref name=\"auvinen273-276\" \/>\n\nWhile ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' served as a supply ship for the minesweeping fleet, her crew rebuilt the rigging dismantled before the war and the school ship spent a couple of days sailing in the Baltic Sea in late 1948. Although there were plans to reactivate her as a school ship for either the Finnish Navy or the Finnish Merchant Fleet, or both, there were issues with her [[naval ensign]] \u2014 as a naval school ship she would not be allowed to carry cargo or be crewed by civilians, but a civilian flag would force her to pay expensive harbour fees. There was also no longer need for a civilian full rigged school ship. In 1949\u20131951, ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' conducted a number of short training and promotional sailings in the Baltic Sea, but never ventured further than the southern tip of [[Gotland]].<ref name=\"auvinen273-276\" \/><ref name=\"aalste93-94\">Aalste et al. (1989), p. 93\u201394.<\/ref>\n\nAlthough everything was ready for the first post-war school sailing, [[Finnish President|President]] [[Juho Kusti Paasikivi|J. K. Paasikivi]] was against the voyage \u2014 sailing a full rigged ship so soon after the war while the [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union]] were still being paid was deemed too flamboyant. Interestingly, it was Paasikivi who, as the director of the Finnish Export Society in the 1930s, had been one of the major supporters of ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen''. The danger of stray naval mines had also not completely disappeared.<ref name=\"auvinen273-276\" \/><ref name=\"aalste93-94\" \/> In 1961, the Finnish Navy purchased [[HMS Porlock Bay (K650)|HMS ''Porlock Bay'']], a [[Bay class frigate|''Bay'' class frigate]], as the new school ship.<ref name=\"auvinen277-278\">Auvinen (2002), pp. 277\u2013278.<\/ref>\n{{-}}\n\n==== Seamen's school (1961\u20131991) ====\n\nIn the late 1940s, the [[Finnish Seamen's Union]] proposed the Finnish government that ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' should be turned into a stationary seamen's school. As nothing happened, the Union renewed its proposal with a different tone in the late 1950s when it learned that the government was planning to sell the old full rigged ship for German scrap dealers and, in fact, the first payment had already been made. The Union gave its ultimatum on 29 April 1959 and when the government did not react, the crews of the inspection ships under the Finnish Maritime Administration went on a strike on 2 May. Before the action could spread, the government acceded and it was agreed that ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' would be stationed in Turku. However, due to intentional delays nothing happened until [[Niilo W\u00e4ll\u00e4ri]], the leader of the Finnish Seamen's Union, presented his final ultimatum on 13 January 1960: if the preparations to turn ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' into a seamen's school did not begin immediately, the Finnish state-owned icebreakers would go into strike on 15 January, effectively stopping all foreign trade. Two days later, [[Sampo (1898 icebreaker)|icebreaker ''Sampo'']] began towing the former school ship through the icefields towards Turku, where the convoy arrived on 17 January 1960.<ref name=\"aalste95-96\">Aalste et al.

Two new classrooms were also built on the deck, slightly altering the appearance of the vessel. The first classes were held on 1 March 1961, and on 4 May the school was officially opened. On the same day, the naval ensign was replaced with the civilian flag.<ref>Aalste et al. (1989), p. 99\u2013103.<\/ref>\n\n''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' served as a seamen's school for 27 years, during which time 3,709 students received their basic training on board the full rigged ship. In the 1980s, the facilities on board the school ship were becoming too small and increasingly obsolete, and there were talks about closing the school by the end of the decade. There was also discussion about turning ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' to a museum ship. The school closed its doors in 1988 and three years later ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' was handed over to the city of Turku.<ref name=\"auvinen278\">Auvinen (2002), p. 278.<\/ref>\n\n==== Museum ship (1991\u2013) ====\n[[File:Suomen Joutsen at night 2005.jpg|thumb|left|''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' at her present location next to [[Forum Marinum]].]]\n\n''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' has been open to the public since 1991.

Her [[standing rigging|standing]] and [[running rigging]] consist of over {{convert|30|km}} of manilla ropes and steel cables. The typical sailing speed of ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' was around {{convert|12|kn}}, but once in the [[North Sea]] she reached a record speed of {{convert|16.4|kn}} with only [[topsail]]s and the [[foresail]].<ref name=\"laennec1\" \/><ref name=\"tekn1\" \/>\n\nThe [[length overall|overall length]] of ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' is {{convert|96|m|ftin}}.

When she was carrying cargo, her tonnage was 2,393 [[register ton]]s [[gross register tonnage|gross]], 1,734 register tons [[net register tonnage|net]] and 3,100 tons [[deadweight tonnage|deadweight]].<ref name=\"tonnage\" group=\"note\" \/> The ship drew {{convert|6.35|m|ftin}} of water when loaded, but as a school ship she sailed with a ballast draft of only {{convert|5.15|m|ftin}}. With 1,200 tons of stones as [[sailing ballast]], her displacement was 2,900 tons and [[metacentric height]] {{convert|0.699|m|ftin}}. Later some of the stone ballast was replaced with concrete and iron.<ref>Juutilainen (1942).<\/ref> Internally her hull was divided into five watertight compartments.<ref name=\"laennec1\" \/><ref name=\"tekn1\" \/>\n\nWhen ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' was converted to a school ship for the Finnish Navy, her general arrangements were changed considerably in order to accommodate up to 180 men on long international voyages. In addition to living quarters, bathrooms and toilets, this included building kitchens and six refrigerated rooms for provisions, workshops for a carpenter, shoemaker and tailor, laundry room, hospital with ten beds and a small isolation ward, classroom, library, canteen, and more storage space for sails, ropes, paint, sand and coal. Nine freshwater tanks with a total capacity of 206 tons were also built, but in order to conserve water a traditional Finnish [[sauna]] was not provided. Instead, hot steam could be diverted into the washing rooms under the forecastle.<ref name=\"tekn1\" \/>\n\nOriginally built without auxiliary propulsion, ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' was refitted with two [[Skandia (engine)|Skandia]] [[hot bulb engine]]s, each producing 200&nbsp;hp, coupled to three-bladed fixed pitch propellers. The twin-shaft propulsion arrangement was very uncommon at that time. In practice the engines were found out to be underpowered, but they could still be used to assist manoeuvering in ports and in heavy weather. Two generators (5&nbsp;kW and 8&nbsp;kW) were added to produce electricity for about three hundred lights. While ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' had a steam boiler for central heating, she did not have steam winches \u2014 anchors and yards were lifted using a [[Capstan (nautical)|manual capstan]].<ref name=\"tekn1\" \/>\n{{-}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Commons category|Suomen Joutsen (ship, 1902)}}\n*{{cite book |last= Auvinen |first= Visa |title= Leijonalippu merell\u00e4 |publisher=Satakunnan Kirjateollisuus Oy| location = Pori |year= 1983 |isbn= 951-95781-1-0 }}\n*{{cite book |last=Auvinen|first=Visa|title=Suomen Joutsen \u2014 Onnekas satavuotias|publisher=TS-Yhtym\u00e4 Oy|year=2002|isbn=951-9129-48-0}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Aalste|first1=Juhani|last2=Aittola|first2=Heikki|last3=Mauno|first3=Jukka|title=Suomen Joutsen|publisher=Merikustannus Oy|year=1989|isbn=951-95457-2-7}}\n*{{cite book |last=Juutilainen |first=Martti |title=Sellainen oli retkemme - Suomen Joutsenen matkat maailman merill\u00e4|publisher=Fennia|year=1942}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http:\/\/www.forum-marinum.fi\/nayttelyt-ja-museoalukset\/museolaivat\/fregatti-suomen-joutsen Suomen Joutsen at Forum Marinum]\n\n{{Surviving ocean going ships}}\n\n{{coord|60|26|10|N|22|14|13|E|display=title|region:FI_type:landmark_source:dewiki}}\n[[Category:Full-rigged ships]]\n[[Category:Training ships]]\n[[Category:Ships of the Finnish Navy]]\n[[Category:Museum ships in Finland]]\n[[Category:Tall ships of France]]\n[[Category:Tall ships of Germany]]\n[[Category:Tall ships of Finland]]\n[[Category:1902 ships]]","timestamp":"20160410102807","user-timestamp":"20150410102807"},{"title":"Get Through","content":"{{unreferenced|date=December 2012}}\n\"Get Through\" was released as the first single by [[Mark Joseph (singer)|Mark Joseph]] in 2003 for his debut album [[Scream (Mark Joseph album)|Scream]].\n\n==Charts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (2003)\n!align=\"left\"|Peak<br \/>position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[UK top 75]]\n|align=\"center\"|38\n|}\n\n[[Category:2003 singles]]\n\n{{2000s-single-stub}}","timestamp":"20160410102807","user-timestamp":"20150410102807"},{"title":"File:Heterobasidion irregulare at Portage WI.jpg","content":"==Summary==\n{{Information\n|Description = This is a photo of a Heterobasidion irregulare conk emerging at a site near Portage WI fall 2012 \n|Source = took a photo on a field trip to the Portage site\n|Date = 2012-09-13\n|Author = [[User:Isael Kate|Isael Kate]]\n}}\n\n==Licensing==\n{{self|GFDL|cc-by-sa-3.0|migration=redundant}}\n{{Copy to Wikimedia Commons|bot=ContinuityBot}}","timestamp":"20160410102808","user-timestamp":"20150410102808"},{"title":"User talk:Zaulus","content":"'''Welcome!'''\n\nHello, and [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to Wikipedia.

Its philosophy is of friendly participation in running for fitness health and social benefit rather than a primary orientation towards competition.\n \n==History==\nDundee Roadrunners was formed in 1984, and its members have been active participants in the sport of running in its various disciplines since that date. The club celebrated it's twenty fifth anniversary in 2009. The club grew out of a group of runners from Valentine's Greetings Cards led by a runner named Dave Roy. The stimulus for this development was running boom of the mid 80s and specifically the second Dundee marathon of that year. By 1985 a membership of 180 runners was recorded rising to 250 the following year. Numbers have declined since that peak but remain healthy with lady runners particularly well represented. Originally based at Lochee Baths in Dundee the club now is meets at [http:\/\/maps.google.co.uk\/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=energie,+main+street+dundee&sll=56.457117,-3.119206&sspn=0.00709,0.022724&g=main+street+dundee&ie=UTF8&hq=energie,&hnear=Main+St,+Longforgan,+Dundee,+DD2,+UK&ll=56.47195,-2.981501&spn=0.014175,0.045447&z=15 Energie], a gym on Main Street in central Dundee. The club has enjoyed much competitive success in both men and ladies' events over many years but remains committed catering for runners of all levels. The club has had strong links with Laufgemeinschaft [[W\u00fcrzburg|W\u00fcrzburg]] since 1986 through Dundee's twinning with this city, and many reciprocal visits have occurred over the years.\n\n==Activities==\nThe club meets every Tuesday and Thursday evening through-out the year at Energie on Main Street. On Tuesdays group runs over 6,8,and 10 miles start at 6.30pm. The club actively recruits new members throught the year and invites any runner interested in running to join these activities without any requirement to join the club formally. In the winter months these runs offer the safely of running in groups on well lit routes. During the summer runs extend to the pleasant hinterland outwith the city , and once a month these runs begin at Clatto Park a country park on the fringes of the town.\nOn Thursdays the members of the club meet for specific training sessions led by the club coaches, which may consists of interval training, hill sessions, or speed drills. Runners within the club run mostly on the road, but actively train and complete in Cross Country and Hill Running, with a number of members also involved in duathlon, triathlon and adventure racing.\n\n==Club Open Races Races==\nThe club organises two open races every year.\n:'''1. Templeton 10 Mile Road Race''' \n:This popular open event is held on the first Sunday in November and has attracted runners of all standards including former World 10000m champion [[Liz McColgan|Liz McColgan]] through to casual fun runners over the years.

In his 30-year film career, he has worked with [[Mel Brooks]], [[George Lucas]], [[Paul Verhoeven]], [[Steven Spielberg]] and many others. His expertise in budgeting and line producing inspired [[Mel Brooks]] to nickname Brown ''\"Mr. On-Budget\"''.<ref>''Planning the Low-Budget Film'', cover blurb.<\/ref>\n\n==Biographical Information and Education==\nBrown was born in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], and moved to Florida with his family during his junior high school years. He attended [[Tulane University]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] where he studied biology and was a pre-med student. At the beginning of his senior year, Brown switched his major to acting and directing in the theater. Upon receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1969, Brown taught in the [[Brevard County, Florida|Brevard County]] public school system in Florida for three years. In 1972, he applied to the [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television]] as a master's degree candidate. When he was not accepted, Brown drove across the country and made an appointment with the Dean of the Film School. Upon learning that Brown had driven all that way to see him, the Dean promptly admitted Brown to the program based on his perseverance. Brown became the graduate teaching assistant in the beginning camera class, and counted amongst his students actor and singer [[Ed Ames]].\n\nWhile at UCLA, Brown considered a career as a screenwriter and was accepted as a client at the [[William Morris Agency]]. In 1974, Brown put aside his writing career and left UCLA when he was accepted into the [[Directors Guild of America]]'s Assistant Directors Training Program. Once in the DGA, Brown rose rapidly through the ranks becoming one of the youngest production managers at [[Universal Studios]] in 1978.\n\n==Career==\nAs producer and production manager, Brown has worked on more than 40 feature films, including the very small (''[[Local Color (film)|Local Color]]'', ''[[The Anarchist Cookbook (film)|The Anarchist Cookbook]]'')  and the very large (''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', ''[[Starship Troopers]]'', and ''[[Hollow Man (film)|Hollow Man]]''), giving him a wide range of production experience.\n\nBrown spent most of his early career at [[Universal Studios]] until ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'', after which he left for [[Lucasfilm]] to work on ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' at the invitation of [[Howard Kazanjian]]. From that point on, Brown's career has taken on a freelance aspect that has allowed him to work on an eclectic list of films and with some of the top actors in the business including [[Michael Douglas]], [[Harrison Ford]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], and [[Kevin Bacon]]. During the filming of a scene with [[Barbra Streisand]] on ''[[All Night Long (1981 film)|All Night Long]]'' in which Streisand was playing a character who could ''not'' sing, Brown remembered, \"...when we started to film that scene, she opened her mouth and this incredible voice came out. And everybody on the set just stood there with their mouths open listening to this. Then she stopped because she was supposed to be singing ''badly''....It was astounding being in the room with her.\"<ref>Spada, James, ''Streisand: Her Life (New York: Crown Publishers Inc., 1995), 396-397.<\/ref>\n\n===Author and teacher===\nBrown is also the author of the critically acclaimed book, ''[[Planning the Low-Budget Film]]'', and has been an adjunct professor at the [[University of Southern California|USC]] School of Cinematic Arts since 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/cinema.usc.edu\/directories\/profile.cfm?id=6465&first=&last=&title=&did=50&referer=%2Fdirectories%2Ffaculty%2Ecfm&startpage=1&startrow=31cinema |title=USC Cinema \u2013 Faculty\/Staff \u00bb Robert Latham Brown |publisher=Cinema.usc.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-13}}<\/ref> Additionally, Brown is a contributing writer to ''Indie Slate Magazine'', writing a series of reviews on film production software.<ref>''Indie Slate magazine'', vol. 12, Issue 55, p19.<\/ref>\n\n===Writing Awards===\nBrown's book, ''Planning the Low-Budget Film'' was a finalist for the 2007 Benjamin Franklin Awards,<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.ibpa-online.org\/benefits\/benjamin-franklin-awards\/|title=IBPA, the Independent Book Publishers Association |publisher=IBPA|date= |accessdate=2012-05-13}}<\/ref> and that same year was a first place winner in the Hollywood Book Festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.hollywoodbookfestival.com\/past.htm |title=Hollywood Book Festival |publisher=Hollywood Book Festival |date= |accessdate=2012-05-13}}<\/ref>\nIn 2002, his screenplay ''Keats'' was named a semi-finalist in the 9th Annual Writer's Network Screenplay and Fiction Competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/fadeinawards.com |title=FADE IN Awards |publisher=Fadeinonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-13}}<\/ref>\n\n==Partial filmography==\n{|<-class=\"wikitable\"-> border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 90%;\"\n|-  style=\"background:#b0c4de; text-align:center;\"\n!

The registration Number of the Association is 123\/2010.  \n       This Association is an amalgamation of persons who are holding the degrees, BSMS, BIM or MD (Siddha). Doctoral and post Doctoral degrees in Siddha Medicines only.\n       Siddha Medical system is a Systematic Medical System in the world enumerated by our \"Sidhars\" who were the greatest medical scientists and therapists of the ancient times. It is Scientific, pragmatic and analytical in diagnosis, treatment and pharmacology.  The other systems of medicines may be scientific, but are not more pragmatic and analytical like the Siddha System of Medicine as the investigation of treatment of this system starts from the man and then only the external impacts that cause diseases to counter the problems for a better living. So this is the only System that believes in the principle of \u201cFood itself is medicine\u201d and during the period of treatment it advocates to take the food rich with iron, protein and fibre so as to prevent any nutritional disorders that may not land up in anaemic conditions.  \n       In Indian system of Medicines apart from plants, herbs and flowers this system has developed a rich and unique treasure of drug knowledge in which the metals and minerals are used. The depth of this knowledge this system  enumerates in the field of metals and mineral for pharmacology , the  materia medica that can be formed and  the detailed drug classification are immense and nano scientific. \n        Hence this Association serves as the progressive platform for the transmission of this knowledge to the modern advances and latest trends. This will enable Siddha medicine and allied sciences a developing dimension in the modern medical world. This Association advocate and struggle to bring in the best utilization of this approach by the government and all Medical Institutions.\n        Even if this progressive approach is achieved partially this Association reiterates that it will definitely assure an economical and an easily accessible medical care to the weaker, poorer and the marginalized. \n        We have reached a period of transition and evolution. This immense knowledge of Siddha Medicines is transferred from the caves of Pothikai Mountain to the institutionally organised Medical Institutions from where students get their degrees. So to protect the dignity and honour of the Siddha Medical Profession and Institutionally qualified persons is a matter of great importance. \n        Hence this Association will try to generate   immense opportunities in the Government welfare schemes dealing with health care for Siddha Medicine and take efforts to coordinate and communicate the important place of us in these schemes.\n        In this period of transition the crop up of medico \u2013 legal problems are a matter of fact. This Association fights for the advancement and protection at all levels in a possible and viable manner and will assist all their members in all possible ways to protect their rights. \n         And their motto is \"'''JOIN TOGETHER BE STRONG FOREVER'''\". This association has more than 1000 siddha medical graduates as its members.","timestamp":"20160410102828","user-timestamp":"20150410102828"},{"title":"Template:Country data Belarusian People's Republic","content":"{{ {{{1<noinclude>|country showdata<\/noinclude>}}}\n| alias = Belarusian People's Republic<!-- 1918-1919 -->\n| flag alias = Flag of Belarus (1991-1995).svg\n| size = {{{size|}}}\n| name = {{{name|}}}\n<noinclude>\n| related1 = Belarus\n| cat = Belarusian peoples republic\n<\/noinclude>\n}}","timestamp":"20160410102829","user-timestamp":"20150410102829"},{"title":"Talk:Dichomeris arquata","content":"{{LepidopteraTalk|class=stub|importance=low}}","timestamp":"20160410102829","user-timestamp":"20150410102829"},{"title":"Template:Manitoba provincial election, 2007\/La Verendrye","content":"{{Canadian election result\/top|MB|2007|La Verendrye (electoral district)|La Verendrye|percent=yes|change=yes|expenditures=yes}}\n{{CANelec|MB|NDP|[[Ron Lemieux]] |4,018 |51.12 |\u22126.95 |''$34,191.10''}}\n{{Canadian_politics\/party_colours\/Progressive_Conservatives\/row}} \n|[[Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba|Progressive Conservative]]\n|Bob Stefaniuk\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" |2,973\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" |37.82\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" |+3.26\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" |''$27,029.65''\n{{CANelec |MB |Liberal |Roland Chaput |490 |6.23 |\u22121.13 |''$1,028.66''}}\n{{Canadian_politics\/party_colours\/Independents\/row}} \n|[[Independent politician|Independent]]\n|Jay Murray\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" |379\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" |4.82\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" |+4.82\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" |''$2,616.77''\n{{CANelec\/total |Total valid votes |7,834 |99.67}}\n{{CANelec\/total |Rejected and declined votes |26}}\n{{CANelec\/total |Turnout |7,860 |60.07 |+7.53}}\n{{CANelec\/total |Electors on the lists |13,129}}\n{{end}}","timestamp":"20160410102830","user-timestamp":"20150410102830"},{"title":"Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Steve Kaufmann","content":"<div class=\"boilerplate metadata afd vfd xfd-closed\" style=\"background-color: #F3F9FF; margin: 2em 0 0 0; padding: 0 10px 0 10px; border: 1px solid #AAAAAA;\">\n:''The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style=\"color:red\">'''Please do not modify it.'''<\/span>  Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a [[Wikipedia:Deletion review|deletion review]]).

Noticing his own resemblance to Halim Eddine, Witte said, he traveled to [[Durr\u00ebs]] with a friend, the [[sword swallowing|sword-swallower]] Max Schlepsig.  He claimed that he had succeeded in being crowned king by the local troops on 13 August 1913. He also claimed that, over the next five days, he enjoyed a [[harem]] and declared war on [[Montenegro]] before his ruse was discovered.  His claims also include that he took a substantial portion of the kingdom's treasury,<ref>Jean-Pierre Bellemare (dir.), ''Les G\u00e9nies de l'arnaque'', Albin Michel, 1994.<\/ref> and along with Schlepsig he managed to escape the palace with the aid of the harem, and eventually made their way out of the country.\n\nMost parts of his story were found to be impossible. There was no Halim Eddine and the Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]]'s son Burhan Eddine, who was offered the throne in 1914, never came; he may be the model for this story.  Originally he claimed this escapade happened in February 1913, when Albania was still under [[Serbia]]n occupation, so he changed the date to August 1913.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} There is no local evidence to support his claims. Nevertheless, he became famous in Germany for his public appearance. The [[Berlin]] police later allowed his official [[identity card]] to bear the artistic [[pseudonym]] ''ehemaliger K\u00f6nig von Albanien'' (\"former King of Albania\"). For the rest of his life he insisted on being greeted with that title, and it was put on his tombstone at [[Ohlsdorf Cemetery]], Hamburg (Parzelle Q 9, 430\u2013433).\n\nHe may have suffered from [[pseudologia fantastica]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}; for example, he claimed to have founded a [[political party]].  He said he was a candidate for the [[president of Germany|German presidency]] in 1925, gaining 25,000 to 230,000 votes in the first round but resigning in favour of [[Paul von Hindenburg]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} The voting records do not support this either. \n\nInterest in Albania was high in the German-speaking world because the [[Great Powers]] had chosen a German prince to sit on the throne.  [[William, Prince of Albania|William of Wied]] was approached for the job in 1913 and ruled for six months in 1914.<ref name =Heaton-Armstrong>{{cite book| last =Heaton-Armstrong| first =Duncan| title =The Six Month Kingdom: Albania 1914| publisher =I.B.Tauris| year =2005| isbn =1-85043-761-0| nopp =true }}<\/ref>  The similarity in name between Wied and Witte may have inspired Witte to make up the story.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nOtto Witte's story was adapted by [[Harry Turtledove]] for his [[fantasy novel]] ''[[Every Inch a King]]''.  Witte's story bears a strong resemblance to the best-selling [[adventure novel]] ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' (1894), of which the first [[film adaptation]] was released in 1913.  The central concept of ''Zenda'' is a commoner being mistaken for a king, and assuming his place.\n\nVarious newspapers and magazines took Otto's story as fact and repeated it, including ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, which published an article about his tale in 1958.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http:\/\/www.time.com\/time\/magazine\/article\/0,9171,868723,00.html The Man Who Was King], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]]'', 25 August 1958, retrieved from ''Time Magazine Archive'' on 12 March 2007\n* [http:\/\/www.ansichtskarten-pankow.de\/witte.htm Otto Witte from Pankow], pictures and postcards.

The main problem that was expressed in this discussion was that the article lacked notability and verifiability due to the lack of coverage in reliable, third party sources. In response, a couple users provided sources to the point where the problems expressed by deletion !votes had been addressed to, to at least some extent (for example, it has been verified that Gray was one of the early founders of the Boy Scouts in the United States). As a result, as was pointed out by the succeeding comment and keep !vote, a certain level of notability and verifiability was established.

This World Series was surrounded by [[Cold War]] political puns pitting the \"[[Communism|Reds]]\" against the \"[[Capitalism|Yanks]]\". But the louder buzz concerned the \"M&M\" boys, [[Roger Maris]] and [[Mickey Mantle]], who spent the summer chasing the ghost of [[Babe Ruth]] and his 60 home run season of 1927. Mantle finished with 54 while Maris set the record of 61 on the last day of the season. With all the attention surrounding the home run race, the World Series seemed almost anti-climactic.\n\nThe Yankees were under the leadership of first-year manager [[Ralph Houk]], who succeeded [[Casey Stengel]]. The Yankees won the American League pennant, finishing eight games better than the [[1961 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]]. The Bronx Bombers also set a Major League record for most home runs in a season with 240. Along with Maris and Mantle, four other Yankees, [[Yogi Berra]], [[Elston Howard]], [[Bill Skowron]], and [[Johnny Blanchard]], hit more than 20 home runs. The pitching staff was also solidified by Cy Young Award-winner [[Whitey Ford]] (25\u20134, 3.21).\n\nThe underdog Reds, skippered by [[Fred Hutchinson]], finished four games ahead of the [[1961 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] in the [[National League]] and boasted four 20-plus home run hitters of their own: NL MVP [[Frank Robinson]], [[Gordy Coleman]], [[Gene Freese]] and [[Wally Post]]. The second-base, shortstop, and catcher positions were platooned, while center fielder [[Vada Pinson]] led the league in hits with 208 and finished second in batting with a .343 average. [[Joey Jay]] (21\u201310, 3.53) led the staff, along with dependable [[Jim O'Toole]] and [[Bob Purkey]].\n\nThe American League added two teams, the [[Los Angeles Angels]] and the [[Washington Senators (1961\u201371)|Washington Senators]],   through expansion and also increased teams' respective schedules by eight games to 162.  The National League was a year away from its own expansion as the Reds and the other NL teams maintained the 154-game schedule.\n\nThe [[Most Valuable Player Award]] for the series went to lefty [[Whitey Ford]], who won two games while throwing 14 shutout innings.\n\nFord left the sixth inning of Game&nbsp;4 due to an injured ankle. He set the record for consecutive scoreless innings during World Series play with 32, when, during the third inning he passed the previous record holder, [[Babe Ruth]], who had pitched {{frac|29|2|3}} consecutive scoreless innings for the [[Boston Red Sox]] in {{wsy|1916}} and {{wsy|1918}}. Ford would extend that record to {{frac|33|2|3}} in the 1962 World Series.\n\nThe 1961 five-game series was the shortest since {{wsy|1954}}, when the New York Giants swept the Cleveland Indians in four games.\n\nThese two teams would meet again at the Fall Classic [[1976 World Series|15 years later]], but this time, the Reds won in a four-game sweep.\n\n==Summary==\n{{MLB Playoff Summary\n| summary = AL [[1961 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] (4) vs. NL [[1961 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] (1)\n| winner =\n| score =\n| score1 = Cincinnati Reds \u2013 0, '''New York Yankees''' \u2013 2\n| date1 = October 4\n| loc1 = [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium (I)]]\n| time1 = 2:11\n| att1 = 62,397\n| ref1 = <ref name=\"Game1\">{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.retrosheet.org\/boxesetc\/1961\/B10040NYA1961.htm|title=1961 World Series Game 1 \u2013 Cincinnati Reds vs. New York Yankees|accessdate=September 13, 2009|publisher=Retrosheet}}<\/ref>\n| score2 = '''Cincinnati Reds''' \u2013 6, New York Yankees \u2013 2\n| date2 = October 5\n| loc2 = Yankee Stadium (I)\n| time2 = 2:43\n| att2 = 63,083\n| ref2 = <ref name=\"Game2\">{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.retrosheet.org\/boxesetc\/1961\/B10050NYA1961.htm|title=1961 World Series Game 2 \u2013 Cincinnati Reds vs. New York Yankees|accessdate=September 13, 2009|publisher=Retrosheet}}<\/ref>\n| score3 = '''New York Yankees''' \u2013 3, Cincinnati Reds \u2013 2\n| date3 = October 7\n| loc3 = [[Crosley Field]]\n| time3 = 2:15\n| att3 = 32,589\n| ref3 = <ref name=\"Game3\">{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.retrosheet.org\/boxesetc\/1961\/B10070CIN1961.htm|title=1961 World Series Game 3 \u2013 New York Yankees vs. Cincinnati Reds|accessdate=September 13, 2009|publisher=Retrosheet}}<\/ref>\n| score4 = '''New York Yankees''' \u2013 7, Cincinnati Reds \u2013 0\n| date4 = October 8\n| loc4 = Crosley Field\n| time4 = 2:27\n| att4 = 32,589\n| ref4 = <ref name=\"Game4\">{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.retrosheet.org\/boxesetc\/1961\/B10080CIN1961.htm|title=1961 World Series Game 4 \u2013 New York Yankees vs. Cincinnati Reds|accessdate=September 13, 2009|publisher=Retrosheet}}<\/ref>\n| score5 = '''New York Yankees''' \u2013 13, Cincinnati Reds \u2013 5\n| date5 = October 9\n| loc5 = Crosley Field\n| time5 = 3:05\n| att5 = 32,589\n| ref5 = <ref name=\"Game5\">{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.retrosheet.org\/boxesetc\/1961\/B10090CIN1961.htm|title=1961 World Series Game 5 \u2013 New York Yankees vs. Cincinnati Reds|accessdate=September 13, 2009|publisher=Retrosheet}}<\/ref>\n}}\n\n==Matchups==\n\n===Game 1===\nWednesday, October 4, 1961 at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] in [[Bronx, New York]]\n{{Linescore|\n|Road=Cincinnati|RoadAbr=CIN\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=0|R4=0|R5=0|R6=0|R7=0|R8=0|R9=0|RR=0|RH=2|RE=0\n|Home='''New York'''|HomeAbr=NYY\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=0|H4=1|H5=0|H6=1|H7=0|H8=0|H9=X|HR=2|HH=6|HE=0\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Whitey Ford]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[Jim O'Toole]] (0\u20131)|SV=\n|RoadHR=|HomeHR=[[Elston Howard]] (1), [[Bill Skowron]] (1)\n|}}\n\nAt [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], [[Whitey Ford]] established himself as the premier post-season pitcher by tossing his third straight World Series shutout. Two home runs were all Ford would need, a fourth-inning shot into the lower right-field stands by [[Elston Howard]], and a sixth-inning shot into the lower left-field stands by [[Bill Skowron|Moose Skowron]]. The two-hour, 11-minute game featured only two hits by the Reds, a first-inning bloop single to left by [[Eddie Kasko]] and a fifth-inning single by [[Wally Post]]. The only other Reds baserunner was [[Frank Robinson]], who walked in the seventh. Otherwise, \"The Chairman of the Board\" Ford was dominant, adding six strikeouts. [[Jim O'Toole]] pitched well for the Reds, allowing just six hits in seven innings, striking out two and walking four.\n\nFord was also aided by two excellent defensive plays by third baseman [[Clete Boyer]]. In the second inning, Boyer backhanded a [[Gene Freese]] ground ball close to the bag, wheeled, and threw out his third-base counterpart from his knees. In the eighth, Boyer dove to his left onto his stomach after a [[Dick Gernert]] ground ball; coming up with the ball, Boyer threw Gernert out, also from his knees.\n\n===Game 2===\nThursday, October 5, 1961 at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] in [[Bronx, New York]]\n{{Linescore|\n|Road='''Cincinnati'''|RoadAbr=CIN\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=0|R4=2|R5=1|R6=1|R7=0|R8=2|R9=0|RR=6|RH=9|RE=0\n|Home=New York|HomeAbr=NYY\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=0|H4=2|H5=0|H6=0|H7=0|H8=0|H9=0|HR=2|HH=4|HE=3\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Joey Jay]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[Ralph Terry]] (0\u20131)|SV=\n|RoadHR=[[Gordy Coleman]] (1)|HomeHR=[[Yogi Berra]] (1)\n|}}\n\nThe Reds came charging back on superb pitching by [[Joey Jay]] to win Game&nbsp;2 and even the series. Reds first baseman [[Gordy Coleman]] and Yankees' left-fielder [[Yogi Berra]] traded two-run homers in the fourth. Coleman hit his homer into the right-center field bleachers after [[Frank Robinson]] reached on an error by Yankees' third-baseman [[Clete Boyer]]. After [[Roger Maris]] led off the bottom half of the inning with a walk, Berra tied the score with a drive into the lower right-field stands.\n\nFrom there, Jay would give up only two more hits, a Berra single in the sixth and a [[Tony Kubek]] single to center in the eighth. The Reds continued to score with single runs in the fifth and sixth and two in the eighth. The Reds went ahead for good with two outs in the fifth when [[Elio Chacon]] sprinted home from third on an [[Elston Howard]] passed ball that didn't get much further than 15 feet away. Yankee starter [[Ralph Terry]] would give up one more run in the sixth on a [[Wally Post]] double and a run- scoring single by eighth-place hitter [[Johnny Edwards (baseball)|Johnny Edwards]], before being lifted in the seventh for pinch-hitter [[H\u00e9ctor L\u00f3pez]].\n\n[[Luis Arroyo]] took over in the eighth and walked Robinson, gave up an infield single to Coleman on a roller between third and the mound and then threw wild to first, with Robinson scoring; Coleman was thrown out trying for third. The next batter, [[Wally Post]], reached safely when Berra misplayed his fly for a three-base error. With Post on third, [[Gene Freese]] was intentionally walked for the second time in the game and Edwards followed with his second hit, a bloop double to left, scoring Post. Jay would seal the victory for the Reds by retiring six of the remaining seven batters, allowing only a walk to [[Clete Boyer]] in the ninth.\n\nThe series shifted to Cincinnati with the pressure on New York. After falling to a perceived inferior team (the [[1960 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]]) in the [[1960 World Series]], a loss that cost long-time manager [[Casey Stengel]] his job, fans and media were wondering if it could happen again as the Yankees limped into Cincinnati with the series tied, having scored a total of just four runs and 10 hits in the first two games as several of the Yankee hitters struggled including the \"M&M Boys.\"\n\n===Game 3===\nSaturday, October 7, 1961 at [[Crosley Field]] in [[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, Ohio]]\n{{Linescore|\n|Road='''New York'''|RoadAbr=NYY\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=0|R4=0|R5=0|R6=0|R7=1|R8=1|R9=1|RR=3|RH=6|RE=1\n|Home=Cincinnati|HomeAbr=CIN\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=1|H4=0|H5=0|H6=0|H7=1|H8=0|H9=0|HR=2|HH=8|HE=0\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Luis Arroyo]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[Bob Purkey]] (0\u20131)|SV=\n|RoadHR=[[Johnny Blanchard]] (1), [[Roger Maris]] (1)|HomeHR=\n|}}\n\n[[Cincinnati]] hosted its first World Series in 21 years at [[Crosley Field]].\n\nGame&nbsp;3 pitted New York's 23-year-old right-hander [[Bill Stafford]] against Reds' veteran knuckleballer [[Bob Purkey]]. Stafford, the winning pitcher when [[Roger Maris]] hit 61st home run, pitched well for {{frac|6|2|3}} innings. Purkey had outstanding control and kept the Yankee hitters off balance, but New York would triumph on a Maris solo home run in the ninth.\n\nCincinnati struck first with a run in the bottom of the third when [[Elio Chacon]] beat out a bunt and took second when Stafford threw wildly to first. [[Eddie Kasko]] fouled out to [[Bill Skowron]] and [[Vada Pinson]] grounded out to send Chacon to third before [[Frank Robinson]] hit a double off the left-field wall to make it 1\u20130.\n\nIn the seventh, the Yankees got a big break to tie the game. [[Tony Kubek]] led off with a single to center, then took second on a [[Johnny Edwards (baseball)|Johnny Edwards]] passed ball. After [[Mickey Mantle]] struck out, [[Yogi Berra]] blooped a ball into short right field that neither second baseman Chacon nor right fielder Robinson called before the two collided, allowing the ball to drop as Kubek scored. The Reds regained the lead in their half of the inning when Edwards doubled into the right-field corner and eventually scored on a Kasko single to left. [[Bud Daley]] came in to relieve Stafford and retired Pinson on a flyout to right to end the inning.\n\nThe Reds' lead would be short-lived, as the Yankees tied the score in the eighth. With two outs, [[Johnny Blanchard]] (pinch-hitting for Daley), smacked a Purkey knuckler into the right-field bleachers. The Reds went quietly in the bottom of the inning, the score tied at 2\u20132.\n\nIn the ninth, Maris recorded what would be one of only two hits in the Series, but this one went into the right field bleachers for a go-ahead home run. With ace reliever [[Luis Arroyo]] on the mound for the Yankees in the ninth, the Reds had one last shot. After [[Gene Freese]] struck out, [[Leo C\u00e1rdenas]], batting for [[Johnny Edwards (baseball)|Johnny Edwards]], doubled off the left-center field scoreboard. [[Dick Gernert]], pinch-hitting for Purkey, grounded out to short, Cardenas holding. The third pinch-hitter in the inning, [[Gus Bell]], ended the Reds' comeback attempt by grounding back to the mound, Arroyo to Skowron, to end the thriller and give the Yankees a two games to one Series lead.\n\n===Game 4===\nSunday, October 8, 1961 at [[Crosley Field]] in [[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, Ohio]]\n{{Linescore|\n|Road='''New York'''|RoadAbr=NYY\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=0|R4=1|R5=1|R6=2|R7=3|R8=0|R9=0|RR=7|RH=11|RE=0\n|Home=Cincinnati|HomeAbr=CIN\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=0|H4=0|H5=0|H6=0|H7=0|H8=0|H9=0|HR=0|HH=5|HE=1\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Whitey Ford]] (2\u20130)|LP=[[Jim O'Toole]] (0\u20132)|SV=[[Jim Coates]] (1)\n|RoadHR=|HomeHR=\n|}}\n\n[[Whitey Ford]] started Game&nbsp;4 for the Yankees in an attempt to continue his post-season shutout streak, but more importantly to give the Bombers a 3\u20131 lead in the Series. He accomplished both. Ford retired the first nine batters of the game; when [[Elio Chacon]] grounded out to [[Bobby Richardson]] at second base for the final out in the third, Ford broke [[Babe Ruth]]'s record of {{frac|29|2|3}} consecutive scoreless innings. Ford remained in the game until the end of the fifth, when an apparent ankle injury forced him to leave, his new record at 32 consecutive shutout innings. [[Jim Coates]] entered the game in the sixth and pitched four shutout innings.\n\nThe Yankees scored the game's first run in the fourth. [[Roger Maris]] led off with a walk and went to third on a single to left-center by [[Mickey Mantle]]. [[Elston Howard]] grounded into a double play, Maris scoring. The Yankees added another run in the fifth on a walk to Ford, a [[Bobby Richardson]] single to right-center and a run-scoring single by [[Tony Kubek]].\n\nIn the sixth, O'Toole was relieved by [[Jim Brosnan]] who got into a jam. With one out, Howard doubled to right-center. After [[Yogi Berra]] was intentionally walked, Skowron loaded the bases by beating out a slow roller to third. [[Clete Boyer]] then doubled to left to plate two runs. The Yankees put on the safety squeeze, only to have Ford bunt right to Reds first baseman [[Gordy Coleman]] who tagged first base. Boyer had moved to third and Skowron had come halfway home before stopping. Coleman then raced across the diamond and tagged Skowron, who was trapped between third and home, for an unassisted double play.\n\nThe Yankees would add three more runs in the seventh to put the game away. New York's seven-run output equaled what the Bronx Bombers were able to put up combined in their first three games as solid Reds starting pitching, combined with a wounded Mantle, kept the New York offense sputtering. That would change in Game&nbsp;5.\n\n===Game 5===\nMonday, October 9, 1961 at [[Crosley Field]] in [[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, Ohio]]\n{{Linescore|\n|Road='''New York'''|RoadAbr=NYY\n|R1=5|R2=1|R3=0|R4=5|R5=0|R6=2|R7=0|R8=0|R9=0|RR=13|RH=15|RE=1\n|Home=Cincinnati|HomeAbr=CIN\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=3|H4=0|H5=2|H6=0|H7=0|H8=0|H9=0|HR=5|HH=11|HE=3\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Bud Daley]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[Joey Jay]] (1\u20131)|SV=\n|RoadHR=[[Johnny Blanchard]] (2), [[H\u00e9ctor L\u00f3pez]] (1)|HomeHR=[[Frank Robinson]] (1), [[Wally Post]] (1)\n|}}\n\nFuture Hall-of-Famers [[Yogi Berra]] and [[Mickey Mantle]] sat out Game&nbsp;5, Berra with a stiff shoulder, Mantle still suffering from a hip abscess. But substitutes [[H\u00e9ctor L\u00f3pez]] and [[Johnny Blanchard]] more than made up for the absence of the two stars. Lopez drove in five runs with a triple and a home run, and Blanchard had three hits included a double and a homer.\n\nIn the first four games, the Yankees scored a total of nine runs off Cincinnati's starting pitchers. In Game&nbsp;5, New York scored five in the first inning. Reds starter [[Joey Jay]], with 14 regular-season complete games, would uncharacteristically get just two outs before being relieved. After [[Bobby Richardson]] singled to start the game, Jay retired [[Tony Kubek]] and [[Roger Maris]] on fly balls. But the flood gates opened when the next batter, Blanchard, hit a two-run homer into the right-field bleachers. [[Elston Howard]] was awarded a ground-rule double when his blast went through an opening in the left-center field scoreboard. [[Bill Skowron]] followed with a long single off the left-field fence, scoring Howard. [[Jim Maloney]] entered the game and was greeted with a Lopez triple that scored Skowron. [[Clete Boyer]] continued the assault doubling off the scoreboard, scoring Lopez. The ninth batter of the inning, Yankee pitcher [[Ralph Terry]] mercifully struck out to end the inning but not until five Yankees had touched home plate.\n\nNew York added to its lead in the second on a Kubek single and a Maris double just inside the left-field line. The Reds cut the lead in half in the bottom of the third and chased Terry in the process. [[Don Blasingame]] led off with a single to center, [[Eddie Kasko]] singled to left and [[Vada Pinson]] hit a fly moving Blasingame to third. [[Frank Robinson]] then took Terry deep with a three-run shot over the right-center field fence. [[Bud Daley]] replaced Terry and shut the door on the Reds.\n\nThe Yankee offense added to its lead with five runs in the fourth, the big blows were a two-run single by Skowron and a three-run home run to dead center by Lopez. The Reds got a little closer after scoring two runs in the bottom of the fifth (on a two-run [[Wally Post]] home run) to cut it to 11\u20135. Then Yankees finished the rout by added two more runs in the sixth on sacrifices by Lopez (on a squeeze play) and Daley (on a fly ball).\n\nHouk became only the third skipper in history to win the World Series in his first season.\n\n==Composite line score==\n1961 World Series '''(4\u20131): [[1961 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] (A.L.)''' over [[1961 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] (N.L.)\n{{Linescore\n|Road='''[[1961 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]]'''\n|R1=5|R2=1|R3=0|R4=9|R5=1|R6=5|R7=4|R8=1|R9=1|RR=27|RH=42|RE=5\n|Home='''[[1961 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]]'''\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=4|H4=2|H5=3|H6=1|H7=1|H8=2|H9=0|HR=13|HH=35|HE=4\n|TotalAttendance=223,247 |AveAttendance=44,649\n|WinPlayerShare=$7,389 |LosePlayerShare=$5,356<ref name=\"wsshares\">{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.baseball-almanac.com\/ws\/wsshares.shtml|title=World Series Gate Receipts and Player Shares|accessdate=June 14, 2009|publisher=Baseball Almanac| archiveurl= http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20090502011628\/http:\/\/www.baseball-almanac.com\/ws\/wsshares.shtml| archivedate=May 2, 2009<!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}<\/ref>\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{WSRefs|year=1961|cohenpp=287\u2013291|reichlerp=2169}}\n\n==External links==\n{{WSExtLinks|year=1961}}\n* [http:\/\/www.redshistory.com The History of the Cincinnati Reds at redshistory.com]\n\n{{WorldSeries}}\n{{New York Yankees}}\n{{Cincinnati Reds}}\n{{1961 New York Yankees}}\n{{Major League Baseball on NBC}}\n{{Major League Baseball on NBC Radio}}\n\n[[Category:World Series]]\n[[Category:1961 Major League Baseball season|World Series]]\n[[Category:New York Yankees postseason]]\n[[Category:Cincinnati Reds postseason]]\n[[Category:1961 in New York|World Series]]\n[[Category:1961 in Ohio|World Series]]\n[[Category:20th century in Cincinnati, Ohio]]\n[[Category:1960s in New York City]]","timestamp":"20160410102845","user-timestamp":"20150410102845"},{"title":"File:Alfa Romeo logo.png","content":"== Summary ==\n{{Non-free use rationale logo\n| Article           = Alfa Romeo\n| Use               = Infobox\n<!-- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION -->\n| Used for          = \n| Owner             = \n| Website           = \n| History           = \n| Commentary        =\n<!--OVERRIDE FIELDS -->\n| Description       = Logo of Alfa Romeo introduced in 2015\n| Source            = http:\/\/www.alfaromeo.com\/com\/alfaromeosoul\n| Portion           = \n| Low_resolution    = \n| Purpose           = <!--Must be specified if Use is not Infobox \/ Org \/ Brand \/ Product-->\n| Replaceability    = \n| other_information = Copyrights: Alfa Romeo\n}}\n\n{{Non-free use rationale logo\n| Article           = template:Alfa Romeo\n| Use               = Brand\n<!-- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION -->\n| Used for          = \n| Owner             = \n| Website           = \n| History           = \n| Commentary        =\n<!--OVERRIDE FIELDS -->\n| Description       = Logo of Alfa Romeo introduced in 2015\n| Source            = http:\/\/www.alfaromeo.com\/com\/alfaromeosoul\n| Portion           = \n| Low_resolution    = \n| Purpose           = The image serves as the primary means of visual identification of the subject\n| Replaceability    = \n| other_information = Copyrights: Alfa Romeo\n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== Licensing ==\n{{Non-free logo|image has rationale=yes}}","timestamp":"20160410102846","user-timestamp":"20150410102846"},{"title":"Talk:Clarica","content":"{{DisambigProject|class=|importance=}}","timestamp":"20160410102846","user-timestamp":"20150410102846"},{"title":"Category:Event venues established in 1953","content":"{{eventestcat|195|3|1949|1960}}","timestamp":"20160410102847","user-timestamp":"20150410102847"},{"title":"Talk:Realtime Worlds","content":"{{WikiProjectBannerShell|1=\n{{WikiProject Scotland|class=Start|importance=mid}}\n{{WikiProject Video games|class=Start|importance=Mid}}\n{{WikiProject Companies}}\n}}\n\n== Administrators' details ==\nFirst time editor here, so I don't know how to add a reference to confirm that it is Paul Dounis (already referenced) and Ken Pattullo (reference needed) of Begbies Traynor Group that are the Joint Administrators.

She was launched in 1794 and was in active service until 1811. Her most famous action was the capture of the French brig ''Ligurienne'' when shortly after ''Peterel'' captured two merchant ships and sent them off with prize crews, three French ships attacked her. She drove two on shore and captured the largest, the 14-gun ''Ligurienne''. ''Peterel'' was converted to a receiving ship at Plymouth in 1811 and was sold in 1827.\n\n==Design and construction==\n''Peterel'' was part of the six-ship ''Pylades''-class of ship-sloops designed by [[John Henslow (Surveyor of the Navy)|Sir John Henslow]].<ref name=Winfield251>{{Harvnb|Winfield|2007|p=251}}<\/ref> The ship was built by John Wilson & Company of [[Frindsbury]], and measured 365 {{fract|57|94}} tons [[Builder's Old Measurement|bm]] with a total length of 105ft 1in. She was initially armed with 16 6-pound guns and 4 \u00bd-pounder swivel guns and carried a complement of 121 men. She was later re-armed with sixteen 24-pounder [[carronade]]s on the upper deck, with six 12-pounder carronades on the [[quarterdeck]] and two 12-pounder carronades on the [[forecastle]].  The ship was ordered on 18 February 1793, laid down in May 1793 and launched on 4 April 1794. She moved to [[Chatham Dockyard|Chatham]] to be fitted-out and have her hull [[copper sheathing|covered with copper plates]] between 4 April and July 1794; at her completion she had cost \u00a37,694 to build including fitting.<ref name=Winfield252\/>\n\n==Service==\n''Peterel'' was commissioned in April 1794 under [[Commander]] Stephen Church. In October Commander [[Edward Leveson-Gower]] replaced Church, only to be replaced in turn in July 1795 by Commander [[Sir Charles Ogle, 2nd Baronet|Charles Ogle]]. ''Peterel'' was at this stage assigned to the squadron in [[the Downs]].<ref name=Winfield252\/> Commander John Temple succeeded Ogle in January 1796. By 31 May ''Peterel'' had joined [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson's]] squadron patrolling off [[Genoa]]. On that day ''Peterel'' was part of a small squadron under Nelson in {{HMS|Agamemnon|1781|2}} that captured six French vessels that were carrying military supplies from Toulon to St. Piere d'Acena for the [[Siege of Mantua (1796-1797)|siege of Mantua]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=13912|startpage=682|date=16 July 1796}}<\/ref> In July she was under the command of Captain Stuart. Stuart and ''Peterel'' directed the landing of troops for the capture of [[Portoferraio|Porto Ferrajo]] on 10 July.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=13923|startpage=794|date=20 August 1796}}<\/ref>\n\nCommander Philip Wodehouse had taken command of ''Peterel'' by December 1796 when ''Peterel'' landed a small party under Lieutenant [[Thomas Staines]] on the coast of Corsica. The landing party attacked a [[Martello tower]], which they captured, and threw its gun, a long 32-pounder, over the cliff.<ref name=Staines>''The Gentleman's magazine'', (September 1830), pp.277-80.<\/ref> \n\n''Peterel''{{'}}s next captain, Commander [[William Proby, Lord Proby|William Proby]], took over in March 1797. In June 1797 Proby authorised Staines to take 20 men in two of the ship's boats to cut out a French privateer that had been preying on merchant vessels off the coast of Tuscany. After a skirmish in which the British had five men wounded and the French lost several dead and wounded, the British took the privateer, which had a crew of 45 men and was armed with two long guns and several swivels.<ref name=Staines\/> \n\nBy August Commander Thomas Caulfield had replaced Proby. Under Caulfield's command ''Peterel'' was involved in the capture of the French [[privateer]] ''L\u00e9opard'' on 30 April 1798. ''Leopard'' was armed with twelve 6-pounder guns and 14 swivel guns. She had a crew of 100 men and had been on the prowl for 20 days, but without having captured anything.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15017|startpage=423|date=19 May 1798}}<\/ref>\n\nAt some later stage she was commanded by Lieutenant Adam Drummond, who was followed by Commander [[Henry Digby (Royal Navy officer)|Henry Digby]].<ref name=Winfield252\/> In September 1798, Digby sailed from Gibraltar to [[Faro, Portugal]], to deliver despatches from [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Earl St. Vincent]] for the Lisbon packet. Staines took the six men in ''Peterel{{'}}''s jolly boat to deliver the despatches to the packet when the jolly boat overturned in heavy seas. Four men drowned and Staines and the other man were only rescued after four hours.<ref name=Staines\/>\n\nDigby's replacement in October that year was to be Commander [[Hugh Downman]], but in November Captain George Long was in command, serving with [[Sir John Duckworth, 1st Baronet|John Duckworth's]] squadron at [[Minorca]].<ref name=Marshall82\/><ref name=Winfield252\/>\n\n==Capture and recapture==\n''Peterel'' participated in the [[Capture of Minorca (1798)]] by the British expedition under Commodore [[Sir John Duckworth, 1st Baronet|John Duckworth]].<ref name=LG15091>{{London Gazette|issue=15091|startpage=1231|endpage=1233|date=24 December 1798}}<\/ref> On 12 November 1798 the Spanish 40-gun frigate ''Flora'', in company with the 40-gun ''Proserpina'' and the 34-gun ships ''Pomona'' and ''Casilda'', captured ''Peterel'' whilst she was operating off [[Minorca]]. One of the Spanish ships fired a broadside after she surrendered.<ref name=Marshall81>Marshall p.81<\/ref> After removing the prisoners from the ship, the Spanish plundered their clothes and possessions, murdering a seaman who attempted to defend his property.<ref name=Marshall81\/> Duckworth detached {{HMS|Argo|1781|2}} to pursue the sloop and on 13 November she retook ''Peterel'' and her 72-man Spanish prize crew, which was under the command of Don Antonio Franco Gandrada, Second Captain of ''Flora''. Captain James Bowen of ''Argo'' put his own prize crew of 46 officers seamen and marines aboard ''Peterel''.<ref name=LG15091\/> Duckworth later appointed his [[first lieutenant]], George Jones, to command ''Peterel''.<ref name=LG15091\/> Most of the clothes belonging to [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] Long and his officers were subsequently recovered.<ref>James\/Chamier p.197<\/ref> This charge of ill-usage was officially contradicted in the [[Madrid]] Gazette of 12 April, but was, nevertheless, essentially true.<ref>James\/Chamier p.197<\/ref><ref group=Note>Commander George Long received command of the then newly-captured Spanish brig {{HMS|Vincejo|1799|2}} in November 1799.

Austen sent these boats and his own to cut out some vessels from the Bay of [[Diano Marina|Diano]], near Genoa. Firing was heard at around midnight and by morning the boats returned, bringing with them a large [[settee (sail)|settee]] carrying wine, and the ''Virginie''. ''Virginie'' was a Turkish-built half-galley that the French had captured at Malta the year before. She had provision for 26 oars and carried six guns.

Some of the Turkish crew of the ship of the line had reached the frigates, but the captain and most of the crew had surrendered to the French.

It is also sometimes referred to as '''company registration'''. These terms are both also used when incorporating a business in the Republic of Ireland. Under [[UK company law]] and most international law, a company or corporation is considered an entity that is separate from the people who own or operate the company.\n\nToday the majority of UK companies are formed the same day electronically. Companies can be created by individuals, specialised agents, solicitors or accountants.  Many solicitors and accountants subcontract incorporation out to specialised company formation agents. Most agents offer company formation packages for less than \u00a3100. The cost of carrying out paper filing directly with Companies House is \u00a320. This fee does not include the cost of witnessing documents or preparation of [[memorandum of association|memorandum & articles of association]] for the company, which would usually be carried out by a solicitor or accountant. Forming a company via the paper filing method can take up to 4 weeks.\n\n==Formation process for limited companies==\n{{Companies law}}\n\n===Paper process===\nUnder section 9 of the [[Companies Act 2006]],<ref>Previously section 10 of the [[Companies Act 1985]]<\/ref> those forming a company must send the following documents, together with the registration fee, to the Registrar of Companies.\n\nMost incorporations submitted by paper take around 5 working days to be accepted.\n\nFor detailed information see the [[Companies House]] guide.<ref>[http:\/\/www.companieshouse.gov.uk\/about\/guidance.shtml Companies House Guide to Company Formation]<\/ref>\n\n====Articles of association====\nThe articles of association (often referred to as just \u2018articles\u2019) is the document which sets out the rules for the running of the company's internal affairs. The company's articles delivered to the Registrar must be signed by each subscriber in front of a witness who must attest the signature.\n\nIn the event that articles are not registered for the new company, model (default) articles will be registered. These model articles can be chosen to be adopted in the IN01 form.   This new procedure was introduced by the Companies Act 2006, Section 20.<ref>http:\/\/www.legislation.gov.uk\/ukpga\/2006\/46\/section\/20<\/ref>\n\n====Form IN01====\nThis contains the intended situation of the Registered Office, (this will be either in England and Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales), the details of the consenting Secretary and Director(s), details of the subscribers and, in the case of a company limited by shares, details of the share capital.   The form also includes the Statement of Compliance that the requirements of the Companies Act have been complied with.\n\n====Memorandum of association====\n\nThis contains the names and signatures of the subscribers that wish to form the company and, in the case of a company limited by shares, a commitment by the subscribers to take at least one share each.   A draft template is available on the Companies House website.<ref>http:\/\/www.companieshouse.gov.uk\/forms\/formsOnline.shtml<\/ref>\nIt sets out constitution of a company and the foundation on which the structure of a company is based. In other words, memorandum of association is considered the charter or constitution of the company because it lays down the objectives of the company precisely and clearly, defines scope of its relation with the investor and outside world.\n\n===Electronic process===\n\nThe [[electronic process of law|electronic process]] can be accessed using compatible software that works with the [[Companies House]] eFiling service<ref>[http:\/\/www.companieshouse.gov.uk\/toolsToHelp\/accountsSoftware.shtml E-Filing compatible software providers]<\/ref> and an account with Companies House.

He was one of the most influential protagonists in darts for almost four decades having set up and run the British Darts Organisation from its inception in 1973 until he was voted off the board in August 2011.\n\nPrior to the formation of the British Darts Organisation, the major organisation for county darts had been the National Darts Association of Great Britain (the NDAGB, commonly referred to as NDA) which had been formed in London on September 25, 1954. Croft began playing darts himself in 1961 for the Harringay Arms in Crouch Hill and was soon playing seven nights per week.\n\n==BDO formation==\nThe British Darts Organisation was formed at its inaugural meeting at Croft's home in Creighton Avenue, Muswell Hill in North London on January 7, 1973. Twelve others attended that meeting including his wife Lorna, Sam Hawkins, Jim Sweeney and James Rogers. They agreed to start an inter-county league that autumn and instead of working within the NDA decided to go it alone.\n\nAfter the British Darts Organisation separated from the NDA in 1973 he said, \"We have 61 counties, our links with television and the big sponsors. Our ultimate aim? I think it is a headquarters where we can hold big finals... But I can't see that in our lifetime.\" \n\nThere are now 66 counties providing competitive darts for men, women and youth, backed up with internal county Super Leagues.\n\nCroft also affiliated the British Darts Organisation as a founder member of the [[World Darts Federation]] which set up the [[WDF World Cup|World Cup]] and [[WDF Europe Cup|Europe Cup]]. \n\n==Darts boom and bust==\nWith the creation of the [[World Masters (darts)|Winmau World Masters]] in 1974 and [[World Professional Darts Championship]] in 1978, darts began to become increasingly popular appearing on BBC television and ITV usually on their [[World of Sport (UK TV series)|''World of Sport'']] show. But as the mid-to-late eighties approached and World of Sport was cancelled, the image of the game collapsed. Some top players became frustrated at lack of opportunities and Croft would become a central character in a devastating [[Split in darts|split in the game.]]\n\n==Acrimonious split==\n{{Main|Split in darts}}\n\nThe top players left the British Darts Organisation and formed the World Darts Council (which is now the [[Professional Darts Corporation]], PDC) but Croft and his organisation proceeded to ban the rebel players from playing County Darts. Croft is quoted as saying \"I don't owe any dart players a breath mint \". The acrimony ended up in court in an expensive proceeding that neither side could really afford either financially or for the good of the game. The two sides eventually came to an agreement in 1997 with a ''[[Professional Darts Corporation#Tomlin order|Tomlin Order]]'' but there is still division, rivalry and often animosity between the two organisations.\n\n==After the split==\nCroft asserted that his British Darts Organisation set-up is for the good of all players and not just a select few. The World Championship still continues, but many of the players that make their way through the county system have gone on to join the PDC as their tournaments offer higher prize money and more chance of making a full-time living from the game.\n\nPassionate debate often rages amongst darts fans as to the relative merits of the BDO and PDC, and Croft's role in the split in the game. He pioneered a system of county darts which still produces top players and in many respects built the game's foundation in the 1970s and 1980s. But criticism for the fact that there are now two Organisations and thus no unified World Championship is equally rife.\n\n[[Mike Watterson]], the sports promoter who created the Embassy World Professional Championship (and arranged the TV and sponsorship deals) is now one of Croft's biggest critics. He says he no longer even watches the BDO World Championship on television, and strongly believes all of the best players now play in the PDC.<ref>[http:\/\/www.supremesnooker.com\/news\/951\/ SupremeSnooker.com]<\/ref>\n\n==Voted off board==\nOn August 7, 2011, Olly Croft was voted off the BDO board at their [[Annual general meeting|AGM]] ending 38 years as the main figurehead of the Organisation.<ref>[http:\/\/www.dartsmonthly.com\/news\/olly-croft-voted-off-bdo-board Olly Croft voted off BDO board]<\/ref> It also brought to an end his role as tournament director for the BDO as Wayne Williams succeeded him. \n\nCroft is the Chief Technical Advisor at the [[World Darts Federation|WDF]].<ref>[http:\/\/www.dartswdf.com\/wdf-info\/wdf-committee\/ WDF list of executives]<\/ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n\n==External links==\n*[http:\/\/lists.topica.com\/lists\/superstarsofdarts\/read\/message.html?sort=&mid=811453101 Interview with Olly Croft]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Croft, Oliver}}\n[[Category:Darts non-player personalities]]\n[[Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire]]\n[[Category:1929 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]","timestamp":"20160410102855","user-timestamp":"20150410102855"},{"title":"User talk:76.217.189.24","content":"\n== January 2011 ==\n\n[[Image:Information.png|25px|alt=|link=]] Welcome to Wikipedia.

Some key benefits of this technology include seamless version updating for globally distributed applications and greater control of memory allocation to the [[Java virtual machine]].\n\n== Functionality ==\nUnlike [[Java applet]]s, Web Start applications do not run inside the browser. By default they run in the same [[sandbox (computer security)|sandbox]] as applets, with several minor extensions like allowing to load and save the file that is explicitly selected by the user through the file selection dialog.  Only [[Digital signature|signed]] applications can be configured to have additional permissions.\n\nWeb Start has an advantage over applets in that it overcomes many compatibility problems with browsers' Java [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]]s and different [[Java virtual machine|JVM]] versions. Web Start programs are no longer an integrated part of the web page, they are independent applications that run in a separate frame.\n\nWeb Start can also launch unmodified applets that are packaged inside .jar files, by writing the appropriate JNLP file.  This file can also pass the applet parameters. Such applets also run in a separate frame.  Applet launcher may not support some specific cases like loading class as resource.\n\nLike applets, Java Web Start is [[cross-platform]].\n\n== Implementation ==\n[[Image:Java WebStartApplicationMan.png|thumb|250px|Early versions of Java Web Start came with an application manager where, e.g., Sun's demo applications could be launched]]\n\nThe developer prepares a special XML file with JNLP extension. This file describes the application requirements, code location, parameters and additional permissions (if any). The browser downloads this file as any other and (following its [[MIME type]], <code>application\/x-java-jnlp-file<\/code>) opens it with Web Start tool. Web Start tool downloads all necessary resources and launches the application.\n\nJava Web Start provides a series of [[Class (computer science)|class]]es in the <code>[http:\/\/java.sun.com\/products\/javawebstart\/docs\/javadoc\/index.html javax.jnlp]<\/code> [[Java package|package]] which provide various services to the application. Sun designed most of these services with the aim of allowing carefully controlled access to resources (such as files and the system clipboard) while restricting the application to authorized operations.\n\nSun introduced version 1.0 of Web Start in March 2001,<ref>\n[http:\/\/www.sun.com\/smi\/Press\/sunflash\/2001-03\/sunflash.20010314.1.html Java Web Start 1.0 press release]\n<\/ref> while 64-bit Windows support was added only in Java 6<ref name=\"win64\">[http:\/\/bugs.sun.com\/view_bug.do?bug_id=4802695 Bug ID 4802695, Support 64-bit Java Plug-in and Java webstart on Windows\/Linux on AMD64]<\/ref> (later than 64-bit Java was first available). Since [[Java Platform, Standard Edition|J2SE]] 1.4 Web Start comes as a default part of [[Java Runtime Environment]] (JRE) called <code>javaws<\/code>, computer administrators no longer have to install it separately.\n\n== Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP) ==\n\nProgrammers often speak of the '''Java Network Launching Protocol''' ('''JNLP''') interchangeably with the term \"Web Start\". The JNLP protocol, defined with an [[XML]] schema, specifies how to launch Java Web Start applications. JNLP consists of a set of rules defining how exactly to implement the launching mechanism. JNLP files include information such as the location of the [[Jar (file format)|jar]] package file and the name of the main class for the application, in addition to any other parameters for the program. A properly configured browser passes JNLP files to a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which in turn downloads the application onto the user's machine and starts executing it. The development of JNLP took place under the [[Java Community Process]] as JSR 56.  {{Clarification needed span|text=It includes the original 1.0 release, the subsequent 1.5 maintenance release, and {{as of | 2006 | lc = on}}, the pending 6.0 maintenance release.|date=April 2013}}\n\nImportant Web Start features include the ability to automatically download and install a JRE in the case where the user does not have Java installed, and for programmers to specify which JRE version a given program needs in order to execute.  The user does not have to remain connected to the Internet to execute the downloaded programs, because they execute from a locally maintained [[cache (computing)|cache]]. Updates of the software download from the Web and become available when the user has a connection to the Internet, thus easing the burden of deployment.\n\nAny computer user can use JNLP simply by installing a JNLP client (most commonly Java Web Start). The installation can occur automatically such that the end-user sees the client launcher downloading and installing the Java application when first executed.\n\nJNLP works in a similar fashion to how HTTP\/HTML works for the web. For [[web browser engine | render]]ing an HTML [[webpage]], after the user clicks on a weblink, the browser submits a URL to a [[webserver]], which replies with an HTML file. The browser then requests the resources referred to by this file (images, [[cascading style sheets|css]]), and finally renders the page once it has received enough information. Page rendering usually starts before all resources have downloaded; some resources not critical to the layout of the page (such as images) can follow on afterwards.\n\nJNLP mirrors this process; in the same way that a Web browser renders a webpage,  a JNLP client \"renders\" a [[Java application|Java app]].  After the user clicks on a weblink, the browser submits an URL to a webserver, which replies with a JNLP file (instead of a HTML file) for the application. The JNLP client parses this file, requests the resources specified (jar files), waits for the retrieval of all required resources, and then launches the application. The JNLP file can list resources as \"lazy\", which informs the JNLP client that the application does not need those resources to start, but can retrieve them later on when\/if the application requests them.\n\n== Example ==\nThe example below gives a simple JNLP file to launch the applet, specifying code base, source, main class and window size. Such file contains all necessary references and is self-sufficient to launch the application. As no permissions are requested, the code will run in a sandbox. JNLP also states that this application can run offline (if already cached) and should be updated as a background process. \n\n<source lang='xml'>\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<jnlp spec=\"1.0+\" codebase=\"http:\/\/ultrastudio.org\/upload\" href=\"\">\n    <information>\n        <title>Launch applet with Web Start<\/title>\n        <vendor>Foo Bar Inc.<\/vendor>\n        <offline-allowed\/>\n    <\/information>\n    <resources>\n        <j2se version=\"1.5+\" href=\"http:\/\/java.sun.com\/products\/autodl\/j2se\"\/>\n        <jar href=\"Ray-2.3-4ca60e46-0956-3f22-983c-e3ed986dfd03.jar\" main=\"true\" \/>\n    <\/resources>\n    <applet-desc name=\"Ray diagram applet\" main-class=\"raydiagramsapplet.Main\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\">\n    <\/applet-desc>\n  <update check=\"background\"\/>\n<\/jnlp>\n<\/source>\n\n== Pack200 compression ==\nTo reduce the size of a Java Web Start application Sun Microsystems introduced a compression system called [[Pack200]] in Java 1.5.0. It can compress a large jar file to one-ninth of its original size if it contains only Java classes.<ref>[http:\/\/java.sun.com\/javase\/6\/docs\/technotes\/guides\/deployment\/deployment-guide\/pack200.html#pack200_compression Pack200 and Compression for Network Deployment]<\/ref>\n\nJava Web Start has supported Pack200 since it first appeared, but initially this feature required server-side cooperation and a certain amount of expertise to set up. When Sun introduced Java SE 6u10, Pack200 support became available without the need for special server support.

He ranks 47th of the 108 Liangshan heroes and 11th of the 72 Earthly Fiends. He is nicknamed \"Iron Face\".\n\n==Background==\nPei Xuan is from Jingzhao Prefecture (\u4eac\u5146\u5e9c; around present-day [[Xi'an]], [[Shaanxi]]), where he serves as a magistrate. He has a reputation for being stern and for always going according to the book in dishing out sentences to criminals, without showing mercy. He does not yield to threats and bribes. As such, he earns himself the nickname \"Iron Face\". Apart from his expertise in law, he is also well versed in swordsmanship and scholarly arts.\n\nPei Xuan's reputation as a fair and just magistrate ultimately gets him into trouble with corrupt officials, who fear that he might interfere in their affairs. They frame him for insubordination, which results in him being arrested and sentenced to exile on Shamen Island (\u6c99\u9580\u5cf6; present-day [[Changdao County]], [[Yantai]], [[Shandong]]). Along the way, he passes by Yinma River (\u98f2\u99ac\u5ddd; in present-day [[Ji County, Tianjin|Ji County]], [[Tianjin]]), where a bandit gang led by [[Deng Fei]] and [[Meng Kang]] is active. The bandits attack the guards and free Pei Xuan, who feels so grateful to them that he joins the gang. He becomes their chief because he is the oldest among the trio.\n\n==Joining Liangshan==\nOne day, [[Dai Zong]] passes by Yinma River and meets the trio. Dai Zong invites them to join the outlaw band at [[Mount Liang|Liangshan Marsh]] and they agree. They disguise themselves as soldiers and travel to Liangshan. Pei Xuan is appointed as the chief military judge of Liangshan after the Grand Assembly of the [[108 Stars of Destiny]]. He oversees the handing out of rewards and punishments and serves as Liangshan's ''de facto'' Chief Justice.\n\nPei Xuan follows the heroes on their campaigns against the [[Liao dynasty|Liao]] invaders and rebel forces after they have been granted amnesty by [[Emperor Huizong of Song|Emperor Huizong]]. During the campaign against the rebel leader [[Wang Qing]], Pei Xuan, [[Xiao Rang]] and [[Jin Dajian]] are captured by Wang Qing's general Liang Yong. They are subjected to torture but they refuse to surrender. Later, Liang Yong's subordinate betrays his superior, kills him and frees the three men.\n\nPei Xuan is one of the few lucky survivors after the final campaign against the rebel forces of [[Fang La]]. He is offered an official post by the emperor in recognition of his contributions but declines the offer and returns to Yinma River with [[Yang Lin (Water Margin)|Yang Lin]].\n\n==References==\n* {{zh icon}} Li, Mengxia.

Edward White, ''Law in American History, Volume 1: From the Colonial Years Through the Civil War'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), 48-51.<\/ref> and has incorporated a number of [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] innovations.\n\n==General overview==\n[[File:Parking regulations sign.jpg|thumb|upright|Law affects every aspect of American life, including [[parking lot]]s. Note the citations to statutes on the sign.]]\n\n===Sources of law===\nIn the United States, the law is derived from five sources: [[United States constitutional law|constitutional law]], [[statutory law]], treaties, [[United States administrative law|administrative regulations]], and the common law (which includes case law).<ref>Paul Bergman and Sara J. Berman-Barrett, ''Represent Yourself In Court: How to Prepare & Try a Winning Case'', 6th ed.

Madison]]'', {{Ussc|5|137|1803|1|Cranch}}.<\/ref>\n\nNotably, a statute does not disappear ''automatically'' merely because it has been found unconstitutional; it must be deleted by a subsequent statute. Many federal and state statutes have remained on the books for decades after they were ruled to be unconstitutional. However, under the principle of ''[[stare decisis]]'', no sensible lower court will enforce an unconstitutional statute, and any court that does so will be reversed by the Supreme Court.<ref>''James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia'', {{ussc|501|529|1991}}.  In this case, the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Supreme Court of Georgia]] had stubbornly refused to retroactively apply a 1984 U.S. Supreme Court decision which had declared a Hawaii statute to be unconstitutional as a violation of the Commerce Clause, even though it was clear that the Georgia statute had exactly the same flaw as the Hawaii statute.  The high court reversed by a 6-3 majority.<\/ref> Conversely, any court that refuses to enforce a constitutional statute (where such constitutionality has been expressly established in prior cases) will risk reversal by the Supreme Court.<ref>See ''Casarotto v.

IV]].<\/ref>\n\nAs common law courts, U.S. courts have inherited the principle of ''stare decisis''.<ref>John C. Dernbach and Cathleen S. Wharton, ''A Practical Guide to Legal Writing & Legal Method'', 2nd ed. (Buffalo: William S. Hein Publishing, 1994), 34-36.<\/ref>  American judges, like common law judges elsewhere, not only apply the law, they also make the law, to the extent that their decisions in the cases before them become precedent for decisions in future cases.<ref>Antonin Scalia and Amy Gutmann, ''A Matter of Interpretation: Federal Courts and the Law'' (Princeton: [[Princeton University Press]], 1998), 3-13.<\/ref>\n\nThe actual substance of English law was formally \"received\" into the United States in several ways.  First, all U.S. states except Louisiana have enacted \"[[reception statutes]]\" which generally state that the common law of England (particularly judge-made law) is the law of the state to the extent that it is not repugnant to domestic law or indigenous conditions.<ref>Miles O. Price & Harry Bitner, ''Effective Legal Research: A Practical Manual of Law Books and Their Use'', 3rd ed. (Buffalo: William Hein & Co., 1969), 272.<\/ref>  Some reception statutes impose a specific cutoff date for reception, such as the date of a colony's founding, while others are deliberately vague.<ref name=\"Ibid\">''Ibid.''<\/ref>  Thus, contemporary U.S. courts often cite pre-Revolution cases when discussing the evolution of an ancient judge-made common law principle into its modern form,<ref name=\"Ibid\" \/> such as the heightened duty of care traditionally imposed upon [[common carrier]]s.<ref>''See, e.g., [https:\/\/scholar.google.com\/scholar_case?case=4265121664793655548 Gomez v. Superior Court]'', 35 Cal. 4th 1125, 29 Cal. Rptr. 3d 352, 113 P.3d 41 (2005) (citing ''Lovett v. Hobbs'', 89 Eng. Rep. 836 (1680)).  The ''Gomez'' court relied on a line of cases originating with ''Lovett'' in order to hold that [[Disneyland]] was a common carrier.<\/ref>\n\nSecond, a small number of important British statutes in effect at the time of the Revolution have been independently reenacted by U.S. states.  Two examples that many lawyers will recognize are the [[Statute of Frauds]] (still widely known in the U.S. by that name) and the [[Fraudulent Conveyances Act 1571|Statute of 13 Elizabeth]] (the ancestor of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act).  Such English statutes are still regularly cited in contemporary American cases interpreting their modern American descendants.<ref>See, e.g., ''[https:\/\/scholar.google.com\/scholar_case?case=16064340394300540634 Phillippe v. Shapell Industries]'', 43 Cal. 3d 1247, 241 Cal. Rptr. 22, 743 P.2d 1279 (1987) (citing original Statute of Frauds from England) and ''[https:\/\/scholar.google.com\/scholar_case?case=7235426128583899206 Meija v. Reed]'', 31 Cal.4th 657, 3 Cal. Rptr. 3d 390, 74 P.3d 166 (2003) (citing Statute of 13 Elizabeth).<\/ref>\n\nHowever, it is important to understand that despite the presence of reception statutes, much of ''contemporary'' American common law has diverged significantly from English common law.<ref>Burnham, 43-44.<\/ref>  The reason is that although the courts of the various Commonwealth nations are often influenced by each other's rulings, American courts rarely follow post-Revolution Commonwealth rulings unless there is no American ruling on point, the facts and law at issue are nearly identical, and the reasoning is strongly persuasive.\n\nEarly on, American courts, even after the Revolution, often did cite contemporary English cases.  This was because appellate decisions from many American courts were not regularly reported until the mid-19th century; lawyers and judges, as creatures of habit, used English legal materials to fill the gap.<ref>Friedman, 69.<\/ref>  But citations to English decisions gradually disappeared during the 19th century as American courts developed their own principles to resolve the legal problems of the American people.<ref>Elizabeth Gaspar Brown, \"Frontier Justice: Wayne County 1796-1836,\" in ''Essays in Nineteenth-Century American Legal History'', ed. Wythe Holt, 676-703 (Westport, CT: [[Greenwood Press]], 1976): 686.  Between 1808 and 1828, the briefs filed in court cases in the [[Territory of Michigan]] changed from a complete reliance on English sources of law to an increasing reliance on citations to American sources.<\/ref> The number of published volumes of American reports soared from eighteen in 1810 to over 8,000 by 1910.<ref>Friedman, 475.<\/ref> By 1879 one of the delegates to the  [[California Constitution|California constitutional convention]] was already complaining: \"Now, when we require them to state the reasons for a decision, we do not mean they shall write a hundred pages of detail. We [do] not mean that they shall include the small cases, and impose on the country all this fine judicial literature, for the Lord knows we have got enough of that already.\"<ref>''[https:\/\/scholar.google.com\/scholar_case?case=5759475885234465900 People v. Kelly]'', 40 Cal.4th 106, 51 Cal. Rptr. 3d 98, 146 P.3d 547 (2006).<\/ref>\n\nToday, in the words of Stanford law professor Lawrence Friedman: \"American cases rarely cite foreign materials. Courts occasionally cite a British classic or two, a famous old case, or a nod to [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]]; but current British law almost never gets any mention.\"<ref>Lawrence M. Friedman, ''American Law in the Twentieth Century'' (New Haven: [[Yale University Press]], 2004), 575.<\/ref> Foreign law has never been cited as binding precedent, but as a reflection of the shared values of Anglo-American civilization or even Western civilization in general.<ref>See ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', 538 U.S. 558 (2003), in which the majority cited a European court decision, ''[[Dudgeon v. United Kingdom]]'', 45 Eur. Ct. H. R. (1981), as indicative of the shared values of Western civilization.<\/ref>\n\n==Levels of law==\n\n===Federal law===\nFederal law originates with the Constitution, which gives Congress the power to enact [[statute]]s for certain limited purposes like regulating [[interstate commerce]].  The [[United States Code]] is the official compilation and codification of the general and permanent federal statutes.  Many statutes give executive branch agencies the power to create [[regulation]]s, which are published in the [[Federal Register]] and codified into the [[Code of Federal Regulations]].  Regulations generally also carry the [[force of law]] under the [[Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.|''Chevron'' doctrine]]. Many lawsuits turn on the meaning of a federal statute or regulation, and judicial interpretations of such meaning carry legal force under the principle of ''[[stare decisis]]''.\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, federal law traditionally focused on areas where there was an express grant of power to the federal government in the federal Constitution, like the [[United States military|military]], [[United States dollar|money]], [[foreign relations]] (especially international treaties), [[tariff]]s, [[intellectual property]] (specifically [[patent]]s and [[copyright]]s), and [[United States Postal Service|mail]].  Since the start of the 20th century, broad interpretations of the [[Commerce Clause|Commerce]] and [[Taxing and Spending Clause|Spending]] Clauses of the Constitution have enabled federal law to expand into areas like [[aviation]], [[telecommunications]], [[railroad]]s, [[pharmaceutical]]s, [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]], and [[trademark]]s.  In some areas, like aviation and railroads, the federal government has developed a comprehensive scheme that preempts virtually all state law, while in others, like family law, a relatively small number of federal statutes (generally covering interstate and international situations) interacts with a much larger body of state law. In areas like antitrust, trademark, and [[employment law]], there are powerful laws at both the federal and state levels that coexist with each other.  In a handful of areas like [[insurance]], Congress has enacted laws expressly refusing to regulate them as long as the states have laws regulating them (see, e.g., the [[McCarran-Ferguson Act]]).\n\n====Statutes====\n{{main|United States Code}}\n{{further|United States Statutes at Large|List of United States federal legislation}}\n[[File:Uscatitle11.jpg|thumb|right|The [[United States Code]], the codification of federal statutory law]]\n\nAfter the President signs a bill into law (or Congress enacts it over his veto), it is delivered to the [[Office of the Federal Register]] (OFR) of the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] (NARA) where it is assigned a law number, and prepared for publication as a [[slip law]].<ref>{{Cite journal | title= Public and Private Laws: About | publisher= [[United States Government Printing Office]] | url= http:\/\/www.gpoaccess.gov\/plaws\/about.html }}<\/ref> Public laws, but not private laws, are also given legal statutory citation by the OFR. At the end of each session of Congress, the slip laws are compiled into bound volumes called the [[United States Statutes at Large]], and they are known as [[session law]]s. The Statutes at Large present a chronological arrangement of the laws in the exact order that they have been enacted.\n\nPublic laws are incorporated into the [[United States Code]], which is a codification of all general and permanent laws of the United States. The main edition is published every six years by the [[Office of the Law Revision Counsel]] of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], and cumulative supplements are published annually.<ref name=\"USC\">{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.gpoaccess.gov\/uscode\/about.html|title=FDsys Help|work=gpoaccess.gov}}<\/ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.gpo.gov\/help\/about_united_states_code.htm|title=About United States Code|work=gpo.gov}}<\/ref> The U.S. Code is arranged by subject matter, and it shows the present status of laws (with amendments already incorporated in the text) that have been amended on one or more occasions.\n\n====Regulations====\n{{main|Code of Federal Regulations}}\n{{further|Federal Register}}\n[[File:Code of Federal Regulations.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Code of Federal Regulations]], the codification of federal [[administrative law]]]]\n\nCongress often enacts statutes that grant broad [[rulemaking]] authority to [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agencies]].  Often, Congress is simply too [[Gridlock (politics)|gridlocked]] to draft detailed statutes that explain how the agency should react to every possible situation, or Congress believes the agency's technical specialists are best equipped to deal with particular fact situations as they arise. Therefore, federal agencies are authorized to promulgate regulations. Under the principle of ''[[Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.|Chevron]]'' deference, regulations normally carry the force of law as long as they are based on a reasonable interpretation of the relevant statutes.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Duffy|first1=John|last2=Herz|first2=Michael|title=A Guide to Judicial and Political Review of Federal Agencies|date=2005|publisher=American Bar Association|location=Chicago|isbn=9781590314838|page=54|url=https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=pWL3kjFpOAAC&pg=PA54}}<\/ref>\n\nRegulations are adopted pursuant to the [[Administrative Procedure Act]]. Regulations are first proposed and published in the Federal Register (FR or Fed. Reg.) and subject to a public comment period.  Eventually, after a period for public comment and revisions based on comments received, a final version is published in the Federal Register. The regulations are codified and incorporated into the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) which is published once a year on a rolling schedule.\n\nBesides regulations formally promulgated under the APA, federal agencies also frequently promulgate an enormous amount of forms, manuals, policy statements, letters, and rulings.  These documents may be considered by a court as persuasive authority as to how a particular statute or regulation may be interpreted (known as ''[[Skidmore v. Swift & Co.|Skidmore]]'' deference), but are not entitled to ''Chevron'' deference.\n\n====Common law, case law and precedent====\n[[File:Unitedstatesreports.jpg|thumb|The [[United States Reports]], the official reporter of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]]]\n{{Further|United States Reports|National Reporter System}}\n\nUnlike the situation with the states, there is no plenary reception statute at the federal level that continued the common law and thereby granted federal courts the power to formulate [[legal precedent]] like their English predecessors. Federal courts are solely creatures of the federal Constitution and the federal Judiciary Acts.<ref>Hughes, 13.<\/ref>  However, it is universally accepted that the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], by vesting \"judicial power\" into the Supreme Court and the inferior federal courts in [[Article Three of the United States Constitution]], thereby vested in them the implied judicial power of common law courts to formulate [[persuasive precedent]]; this power was widely accepted, understood, and recognized by the Founding Fathers at the time the Constitution was ratified.<ref name=\"Hart\">''Hart v. Massanari'', 266 F.3d 1155 (9th Cir. 2001), citing ''Anastasoff v. United States'', 223 F.3d 898, ''vacated as moot on reh'g en banc'', 235 F.3d 1054 (8th Cir. 2000).<\/ref> Several legal scholars have argued that the federal judicial power to decide \"[[Case or Controversy Clause|cases or controversies]]\" necessarily includes the power to decide the precedential effect of those cases and controversies.<ref>Michael J. Gerhardt, ''The Power of Precedent'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2008), 59.<\/ref>\n\nThe difficult question is whether federal judicial power extends to formulating [[binding precedent]] through strict adherence to the rule of ''stare decisis''. This is where the act of deciding a case becomes a limited form of lawmaking in itself, in that an appellate court's rulings will thereby bind itself and lower courts in future cases (and therefore also impliedly binds all persons within the court's jurisdiction). Prior to a major change to federal court rules in 2007, about one-fifth of federal appellate cases were published and thereby became binding precedents, while the rest were unpublished and bound only the parties to each case.<ref name=\"Hart\" \/>\n\nAs federal judge [[Alex Kozinski]] has pointed out, binding precedent as we know it today simply did not exist at the time the Constitution was framed.<ref name=\"Hart\" \/>  Judicial decisions were not consistently, accurately, and faithfully reported on both sides of the Atlantic (reporters often simply rewrote or failed to publish decisions which they disliked), and the United Kingdom lacked a coherent court hierarchy prior to the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Hart\" \/>  Furthermore, English judges in the eighteenth century subscribed to now-obsolete [[natural law]] theories of law, by which law was believed to have an existence independent of what individual judges said. Judges saw themselves as merely declaring the law which had always theoretically existed, and not as making the law.<ref name=\"Hart\" \/> Therefore, a judge could reject another judge's opinion as simply an incorrect statement of the law, in the way that scientists regularly reject each other's conclusions as incorrect statements of the laws of science.<ref name=\"Hart\" \/>\n\nIn turn, according to Kozinski's analysis, the contemporary rule of binding precedent became possible in the U.S. in the nineteenth century only after the creation of a clear court hierarchy (under the [[Judiciary Act (disambiguation)|Judiciary Act]]s), and the beginning of regular ''verbatim'' publication of U.S. appellate decisions by [[Thomson West|West Publishing]].<ref name=\"Hart\" \/>  The rule gradually developed, case-by-case, as an extension of the judiciary's [[public policy]] of effective judicial administration (that is, in order to efficiently exercise the judicial power).<ref name=\"Hart\" \/> The rule of precedent is generally justified today as a matter of public policy, first, as a matter of fundamental fairness, and second, because in the absence of case law, it would be completely unworkable for every minor issue in every legal case to be briefed, argued, and decided from first principles (such as relevant statutes, constitutional provisions, and underlying public policies), which in turn would create hopeless inefficiency, instability, and unpredictability, and thereby undermine the [[rule of law]].<ref>Daniel A. Farber and Suzanna Sherry, ''Judgment Calls: Principle and Politics in Constitutional Law'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2008), 70-71.<\/ref><ref>Frederick Schauer, ''Precedent'', 39 <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Stan. L. Rev.<\/span> 571, 595-602 (1987).<\/ref>\n\nHere is a typical exposition of that public policy in a 2008 [[majority opinion]] signed by Associate Justice [[Stephen Breyer]]:\n\n<blockquote>Justice Brandeis once observed that \"in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right.\" ''Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co.'' [...] To overturn a decision settling one such matter simply because we might believe that decision is no longer \"right\" would inevitably reflect a willingness to reconsider others. And that willingness could itself threaten to substitute disruption, confusion, and uncertainty for necessary legal stability. We have not found here any factors that might overcome these considerations.<ref>''[[John R. Sand Gravel Co. v. United States]]'', {{ussc|552|130}}, 139 (2008).<\/ref><\/blockquote>\n\nIt is now sometimes possible, over time, for a line of precedents to drift from the express language of any underlying statutory or constitutional texts until the courts' decisions establish doctrines that were not considered by the texts' drafters. This trend has been strongly evident in federal [[substantive due process]]<ref>Cass R. Sunstein, ''Designing Democracy: What Constitutions Do'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), 80.<\/ref> and Commerce Clause decisions.<ref>Raoul Berger, \"Judicial Manipulation of the Commerce Clause,\" <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">74 Tex.

Although federal courts can create federal common law in the form of case law, such law must be linked one way or another to the interpretation of a particular federal constitutional provision, statute, or regulation (which in turn was enacted as part of the Constitution or after). Federal courts lack the plenary power possessed by state courts to simply make up law, which the latter are able to do in the absence of constitutional or statutory provisions replacing the common law. Only in a few narrow limited areas, like maritime law,<ref>''Romero v. International Terminal Operating Co.'', 358 U.S. 354, 360\u2013361 (1959).<\/ref> has the Constitution expressly authorized the continuation of English common law at the federal level (meaning that in those areas federal courts can continue to make law as they see fit, subject to the limitations of ''stare decisis'').\n\nThe other major implication of the ''Erie'' doctrine is that federal courts cannot dictate the content of state law when there is no federal issue (and thus no federal supremacy issue) in a case.<ref>''[[Klaxon Co. v.

(Clifton Park, NY: Delmar, 2012), 97-103.<\/ref>  In turn, procedural law is divided into criminal procedure and civil procedure.<ref name=\"Walston-Dunham\" \/>\n\n====Criminal procedure====\nThe law of [[criminal procedure]] in the United States consists of a massive overlay of federal constitutional case law interwoven with the federal and state statutes that actually provide the foundation for the creation and operation of law enforcement agencies and prison systems as well as the proceedings in criminal trials.  Due to the perennial inability of legislatures in the U.S. to enact statutes that would actually force law enforcement officers to respect the constitutional rights of criminal suspects and convicts, the federal judiciary gradually developed the [[exclusionary rule]] as a method to enforce such rights.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Urbonya, Kathryn R.|editor1-last=Ross|editor1-first=Mary Massaron|editor2-last=Voss|editor2-first=Edwin P.|title=Sword and Shield: A Practical Approach to Section 1983 Litigation|date=2006|publisher=American Bar Association|location=Chicago|isbn=9781590317662|pages=249\u2013300|url=https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=1xzC2zvZNGUC&pg=PA249|accessdate=1 July 2015|chapter=Fourth Amendment Federalism?: The Court's Vacillating Mistrust and Trust of State Search and Seizure Laws}}<\/ref>  In turn, the exclusionary rule spawned a family of judge-made remedies for the abuse of law enforcement powers, of which the most famous is the [[Miranda warning]].  The writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' is often used by suspects and convicts to challenge their detention, while the [[Civil Rights Act of 1871]] and ''[[Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents|Bivens]]'' actions are used by suspects to recover tort damages for police brutality.\n\n====Civil procedure====\n{{main|Civil procedure in the United States}}\nThe law of [[civil procedure]] governs process in all judicial proceedings involving lawsuits between private parties.  Traditional common law [[pleading]] was replaced by code pleading in 24 states after New York enacted the [[Field Code]] in 1850 and code pleading in turn was subsequently replaced again in most states by modern notice pleading during the 20th century.  The old English division between common law and [[Equity (law)|equity]] courts was abolished in the federal courts by the adoption of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] in 1938; it has also been independently abolished by legislative acts in nearly all states.  The [[Delaware Court of Chancery]] is the most prominent of the small number of remaining equity courts.\n\nThirty-five states have adopted rules of civil procedure modeled after the FRCP (including rule numbers).  However, in doing so, they had to make some modifications to account for the fact that state courts have broad general jurisdiction while federal courts have relatively limited jurisdiction.\n\nNew York, Illinois, and California are the most significant states that have not adopted the FRCP.  Furthermore, all three states continue to maintain most of their civil procedure laws in the form of codified statutes enacted by the state legislature, as opposed to court rules promulgated by the state supreme court, on the ground that the latter are undemocratic.  But certain key portions of their civil procedure laws have been modified by their legislatures to bring them closer to federal civil procedure.<ref>For example, Section 437c of the California Code of Civil Procedure was amended by the state legislature several times in the 1990s to bring California's summary judgment standard in line with Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  See ''Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.'', [http:\/\/online.ceb.com\/calcases\/C4\/25C4t826.htm 25 Cal. 4th 826], 849 (2001).<\/ref>\n\nGenerally, American civil procedure has several notable features, including extensive pretrial [[Discovery (law)|discovery]], heavy reliance on live testimony obtained at [[Deposition (law)|deposition]] or elicited in front of a [[jury]], and aggressive pretrial \"law and motion\" practice designed to result in a pretrial disposition (that is, [[summary judgment]]) or a settlement.  U.S. courts pioneered the concept of the opt-out [[class action]], by which the burden falls on class members to notify the court that they do not wish to be bound by the judgment, as opposed to opt-in class actions, where class members must join into the class.  Another unique feature is the so-called [[American rule (attorney's fees)|American Rule]] under which parties generally bear their own attorneys' fees (as opposed to the [[English Rule]] of \"loser pays\"), though American legislators and courts have carved out numerous exceptions.\n\n===Substantive law===\n\nSubstantive law comprises the actual \"substance\" of the law; that is, the law that defines legally enforceable rights and duties, and what wrongful acts amount to violations of those rights and duties.  Because substantive law by definition is enormous, the following summary briefly covers only a few highlights of each of the major components of American substantive law.\n\n====Criminal law====\n{{main|Criminal law of the United States}}\nCriminal law involves the [[prosecution]] by the state of wrongful acts which are considered to be so serious that they are a breach of the sovereign's peace (and cannot be deterred or remedied by mere lawsuits between private parties).  Generally, [[crime]]s can result in [[incarceration]], but torts (see below) cannot.  The majority of the crimes committed in the United States are prosecuted and punished at the state level.  Federal criminal law focuses on areas specifically relevant to the federal government like evading payment of federal income tax, mail theft, or physical attacks on federal officials, as well as interstate crimes like drug trafficking and wire fraud.\n\nAll states have somewhat similar laws in regard to \"higher crimes\" (or [[felonies]]), such as [[murder]] and [[rape]], although penalties for these crimes may vary from state to state.  [[Capital punishment in the United States|Capital punishment]] is permitted in some states but not others.  [[Three strikes law]]s in certain states impose harsh penalties on repeat offenders.\n\nSome states distinguish between two levels: felonies and [[misdemeanor]]s (minor crimes).  Generally, most felony convictions result in lengthy [[prison]] sentences as well as subsequent [[probation]], large [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], and orders to pay [[restitution]] directly to victims; while misdemeanors may lead to a year or less in jail and a substantial fine.  To simplify the prosecution of traffic violations and other relatively minor crimes, some states have added a third level, [[infraction]]s.  These may result in fines and sometimes the loss of one's driver's license, but no jail time.\n\nFor public welfare offenses where the state is punishing merely risky (as opposed to injurious) behavior, there is significant diversity across the various states.  For example, punishments for [[drunk driving]] varied greatly prior to 1990. State laws dealing with [[Recreational drug use|drug crimes]] still vary widely, with some states treating possession of small amounts of drugs as a misdemeanor offense or as a medical issue and others categorizing the same offense as a serious [[felony]].\n\n====Contract law====\n[[File:Uniform Commercial Code.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Uniform Commercial Code]]]]\n{{main|United States contract law}}\n[[Contract law]] covers obligations established by agreement (express or implied) between private parties.  Generally, contract law in transactions involving the sale of goods has become highly standardized nationwide as a result of the widespread adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code.  However, there is still significant diversity in the interpretation of other kinds of contracts, depending upon the extent to which a given state has codified its common law of contracts or adopted portions of the [[Restatement (Second) of Contracts]].\n\nParties are permitted to agree to [[arbitration|arbitrate]] disputes arising from their contracts.  Under the [[Federal Arbitration Act]] (which has been interpreted to cover ''all'' contracts arising under federal or state law), arbitration clauses are generally enforceable unless the party resisting arbitration can show [[unconscionability]] or [[fraud]] or something else which undermines the entire contract.\n\n====Tort law====\n{{main|United States tort law}}\n[[File:Restatement Second of Torts.jpg|thumb|right|The Restatement (Second) of Torts, a highly influential restatement of [[United States tort law]]]]\nTort law generally covers any civil action between private parties arising from wrongful acts which amount to a breach of general obligations imposed by law and not by contract.\n\nTort law covers the entire imaginable spectrum of wrongs which humans can inflict upon each other, and of course, partially overlaps with wrongs also punishable by criminal law.  Although the American Law Institute has attempted to standardize tort law through the development of several versions of the Restatement of Torts, many states have chosen to adopt only certain sections of the Restatements and to reject others.  Thus, because of its immense size and diversity, American tort law cannot be easily summarized.\n\nFor example, a few jurisdictions allow actions for [[negligent infliction of emotional distress]] even in the absence of physical injury to the plaintiff, but most do not.  For any particular tort, states differ on the causes of action, types and scope of remedies, statutes of limitations, and the amount of specificity with which one must plead the cause.  With practically any aspect of tort law, there is a \"majority rule\" adhered to by most states, and one or more \"minority rules.\"\n\nNotably, the most broadly influential innovation of 20th-century American tort law was the rule of [[strict liability]] for [[product liability|defective products]], which originated with judicial glosses on the law of [[warranty]].  In 1963, [[Roger J. Traynor]] of the [[Supreme Court of California]] threw away [[legal fiction]]s based on warranties and imposed strict liability for defective products as a matter of [[Public policy (law)|public policy]] in the landmark case of ''Greenman v. Yuba Power Products''.<ref>Mark A. Kinzie & Christine F. Hart, ''Product Liability Litigation'' (Clifton Park, NY: Thomson Delmar Learning, 2002), 100-101.  See also ''Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc.'', [http:\/\/online.ceb.com\/CalCases\/C2\/59C2d57.htm 59 Cal. 2d 57] (1963).<\/ref>  The American Law Institute subsequently adopted a slightly different version of the ''Greenman'' rule in Section 402A of the ''Restatement (Second) of Torts'', which was published in 1964 and was very influential throughout the United States.<ref>Kinzie & Hart, 101.<\/ref>  Outside the U.S., the rule was adopted by the European Economic Community in the Product Liability Directive of July 1985<ref>Norbert Reich, ''Understanding EU Law: Objectives, Principles and Methods of Community Law'' (Antwerp: Intersentia, 2005), 337.<\/ref> by Australia in July 1992<ref>Ellen E.

Maclachlan, ''Consumer Politics in Postwar Japan'' (New York: [[Columbia University Press]], 2002), 226.<\/ref>\n\nBy the 1990s, the avalanche of American cases resulting from ''Greenman'' and Section 402A had become so complicated that another restatement was needed, which occurred with the 1997 publication of the ''Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http:\/\/www.ali.org\/ali_old\/promo6081.htm |title=ALI Restatement of the Law Third, Torts: Products Liability |publisher=Ali.org |deadurl=no |accessdate=September 23, 2013}}<\/ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Admission to the bar in the United States]]\n*[[Attorneys in the United States]]\n*''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]''\n*[[Courts of the United States]]\n*[[Legal education in the United States]]\n**[[Law school in the United States]]\n*[[Legal systems of the world]]\n*[[Privacy laws of the United States]]\n\n===Lists===\n*[[Legal research in the United States]]\n*[[List of sources of law in the United States]]\n*[[List of Uniform Acts (United States)]]\u2014intended for state-level legislation\n*[[List of United States federal legislation]]\n*[[List of United States Supreme Court cases]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Friedman, Lawrence M.

His most notable contributions include the [[Art Deco]] structures of [[Fair Park]] while he oversaw planning and construction of the 1936 [[Texas Centennial Exposition]]. In 1970, in anticipation of imminent commercial growth brought on by the impending development of the Dallas\/Fort Worth International Airport, he designed the First National Bank of Grapevine building at 1400 South Main Street.  This iconic cubist structure served as a harbinger of the area's upcoming economic development.\n\n==Background==\nGeorge Dahl was born in [[Minneapolis]] to [[Norwegian American|Norwegian immigrant]] parents, Olaf G. and Laura (Olsen) Dahl. He received a [[Bachelor of Architecture|B.Arch.]] from the [[University of Minnesota]] and a [[Master of Architecture|M.Arch.]] from [[Harvard Graduate School of Design|Harvard University]] in 1923. He subsequently spent two years in [[Italy]] as a fellow at the [[American Academy in Rome]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http:\/\/www.lib.utexas.edu\/taro\/utaaa\/00028\/aaa-00028.html |title=''George Dahl: An Inventory of his Papers, 1916-1991'' |work=Texas Archival Resources Online |publisher=University of Texas at Austin |accessdate=2009-10-19}}<\/ref>\n\n==Career==\nIn 1926, he began work for the [[Herbert M. Greene]] Co. in [[Dallas]], Texas. He became a partner in Greene's firm in 1928, and the name of the firm was changed to Herbert M. Greene, LaRoche, and Dahl (later LaRoche and Dahl).\n\nIn 1943, Dahl founded his own company, George Leighton Dahl, Architects and Engineers, Incorporated. He was among the first Texas architects to have a nationwide practice and was among the pioneers in fast-track design, which allowed for actual construction to begin even before the design was finished.<ref>[http:\/\/www.tshaonline.org\/handbook\/online\/articles\/fda86 ''Dahl, George Leighton'' (Texas State Historical Association)]<\/ref> Upon his retirement in 1973, he had produced some 3,000 projects throughout the country that are estimated to be worth $3 billion.\n\n==Personal life==\nDahl was married twice-in 1921 to Lillie E. Olsen, with whom he had one daughter, and in 1978 to Joan Renfro. Dahl died of cancer at the age of ninety-three at his home in Dallas.\n\n==Significant work==\n[[File:Dallas Fair Park Esplanade.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Art Deco buildings in [[Fair Park]]]]\n\n[[File:Dallas Elm Place.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First National Bank Tower ([[Elm Place]])]]\n\n'''Dallas Projects:'''\n\n{| cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 0 1em 1em 0; font-size: 90%;\"\n|-\n|- bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"\n!Year Completed||Building||Address||Notes\n|-\n| 1927 || [[Neiman Marcus Building]] || 1618 Main Street\n|- bgcolor=\"efefef\"\n| 1929 || [[Titche-Goettinger Building]] || 1900 Elm Street\n|- \n| 1930 || Volk Brothers Building ||\n|- bgcolor=\"efefef\"\n| 1934 || [[Singer Building (Dallas, Texas)]] || 1514 Elm\n|- \n| 1936 || [[Fair Park#Tower Building|Tower Building]] || [[Fair Park]]\n|- bgcolor=\"efefef\"\n| 1936 || [[Fair Park#Esplanade|Esplanade of State]] || [[Fair Park]]\n|- \n| 1936 || [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|Cotton Bowl]] || [[Fair Park]]\n|- bgcolor=\"efefef\"\n| 1938, 1972 || Hillcrest State Bank || || First [[drive-through]] bank\n|- \n| 1947 || Mayfair Department Store || 141 Elm Street\n|- bgcolor=\"efefef\"\n| 1948 || American Poster & Printing Building || 1600 S Akard Street\n|- \n| 1949 || [[Remington Rand]] Building || 2100 N Akard Street\n|- bgcolor=\"efefef\"\n| 1949 || [[Dallas Morning News]] Building || 508 Young Street\n|- \n| 1949 || Merchants State Bank || Ross\/Henderson\n|- bgcolor=\"efefef\"\n| 1949 || Philipson's Fashions || Elm\/St Paul\n|- \n| 1949 || [[Dallas Morning News]] Building || Young Street\n|- \n| 1950 || Employers Insurance Building ||\n|- bgcolor=\"efefef\"\n| 1950 || Great American Reserve Insurance Building || 2020 Live Oak Street\n|- \n| 1951 || [[Park Cities, Texas|Park Cities]] [[YMCA]] || 6000 Preston Road\n|- bgcolor=\"efefef\"\n| 1953 || [[Grupo Bimbo|Mrs. Baird's Bakery]] || Central Expressway\/Mockingbird\n|- \n| 1955 || [[Old Dallas Central Library]] || 1954 Commerce Street\n|- bgcolor=\"efefef\"\n| 1956 || [[Congregation Shearith Israel]] ||\n|-\n| 1957 || Dallas Federal Savings and Loan || 1505 Elm Street\n|- bgcolor=\"efefef\"\n| 1957 || [[Dallas Memorial Auditorium]] ||\n|- \n| 1964 || Southwestern Life Building || Ross\/Akard\n|- bgcolor=\"efefef\"\n| 1965 || Owen Fine Art Center || [[Southern Methodist University]]\n|- \n| 1965 || [[Elm Place|First National Bank Tower]] || 1401 Elm Street\n|- \n| 1969 || [[Turtle Creek, Dallas|Turtle Creek Village]] || Oak Lawn\/Blackburn\n|- \n| 1970 || [[Ling-Temco-Vought|LTV Aerospace]] || Grand Prairie\n|-\n| 1970 || [[First National Bank of Grapevine]] || 1400 South Main Street, Grapevine\n|-\n| 1971 || [[Earle Cabell Federal Building and Courthouse|Earle Cabell Federal Building]]\n|}\n\n  \n'''Other Projects:'''\n* DC Stadium, later renamed to [[RFK Stadium]], [[Washington, Dc]], 1962\n* [[Tanglewood Resort]], [[Lake Texoma]], 1960\n* Medical facilities for: [[Dallas Methodist Hospital]], [[Dallas Public Health Center]]\n* Central Library for The [[University of Texas at Arlington]]<ref>Barker, Evelyn and Lea Worcester.

It was Yahweh, not Marduk, who defeated primeval chaos, the \"great deep\" (Isa 51:10), Second Isaiah repeatedly says, it was Yahweh, not Marduk, who created the world; Isaiah 40:12 \"Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and marked off the heavens with a span, enclosed the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance?\" It was Yahweh, not Marduk, who formed light and created darkness; Isaiah 45:7 \"I form light and create darkness, I make weal and create woe; I the LORD do all these things. \" Moreover, unlike Marduk, God did it alone without any assistance; Isaiah 44:24 \"I am the LORD, who made all things, who alone stretched out the heavens, who by myself spread out the earth\", Isaiah 43:10 \"Before me no god was formed, nor shall there be any after me.\"\n*::\"I am the Lord (Yahweh), your God (Elohim), who took you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. You shall not have another god (Elohim) in My presence.\"(Exodus, 20:2-3) \"I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as Almighty God ([[El Shaddai]]), but [with] My name Lord (Yahweh), I did not become known to them.\"(Exodus, 6:3)\n{|width=\"100%\"\n|+'''The Shema'''\n|Hebrew ||\u05e9\u05de\u05e2 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05d9\u05d9 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d9\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d7\u05d3\n|-\n|Common transliteration ||Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad\n|-\n|English ||Hear, O Israel! The {{LORD}} is our God! The {{LORD}} is One!\n|}\n*::Judaism, however, insists that the \"{{LORD}} is One,\" as in the Shema, and at least two interpretations exist to explain the Torah's use of the plural form. The first is that the plural form \"Elohim\" is analogous to the [[royal plural]] as used in English. The second is that, in order to set an example for human kings, Elohim consulted with his court (the angels, just created) before making a major decision (creating man).\n\n*[[God of Israel]]\n*::The [[eponymous ancestor]] of the Israelites is [[Jacob]], the [[biblical patriarch]] who was dubbed ''Israel'' \"[[el (god)|God]] rules\/struggles\" (or \"one who has prevailed with God\", Rashi) after his encounter with God at the [[Jabbok]]. For this reason, the God of Israel is also known as '''God of Jacob''', and after the earlier [[biblical patriarchs]] as '''God of Abraham''' and '''God of Isaac''' ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 3:6: {{lang|he|\u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d1\u05e8\u05d4\u05dd \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e6\u05d7\u05e7 \u05d5\u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e2\u05e7\u05d1}}). The Hebrew Bible frequently references the God of Israel as {{lang|he|\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc}}, literally \"Yahweh, the Elohim of Israel\", rendered in [[English Bible translations]] as \"the {{LORD}}, God of Israel\".(e.g. Exodus 5:1, Joshua 7:13, etc.; in Exodus 34:23 also {{lang|he| \u05d4\u05d0\u05d3\u05d5\u05df \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc}} \"the Lord, {{GOD}} of Israel\".)\n*::In Judaism, the Tetragrammaton is conventionally substituted by [[Adonai]] (\"my Lord\") when reading the text of the Bible. Based on this practice, the traditional translation of the Tetragrammaton in Christian Bibles is \"the {{LORD}}\". When transcribing the Tetragrammaton, the vocalization [[Jehovah]] has been popular in particular in [[Protestantism]] from the time of the [[Reformation]].\n*::The King James Bible, the New American Standard Bible, and the New International Version substitute the titles \u201cLORD\u201d and \u201cGOD\u201d with all the letters capitalized where the Name \u201cYahweh\u201d actually belongs. The name \"Yahweh\" does not appear in the text of most popular English Bible translations on the market today. Jewish Bible scholars introduced this tradition in the mid-2nd century B.C., and it has continued since that time. In 1611, the inaugural edition of the King James Bible editors did not include the name \u201dYahweh.\u201d\n\n*[[Zechariah (priest)]]\n*::Quotation:\n*::::And said: \"O my {{LORD}}, my bones decay, my head is white and hoary, yet in calling You, O {{LORD}}, I have never been deprived.\n*::::But I fear my relatives after me; and my wife is barren.

With the success of the Mozilla Firefox, however, demand increased for a mail client to go with it, and the work on Minotaur was revived under the new name of [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]], and migrated to the new toolkit developed by the Firefox team.\n\n==Early beginnings: A simple email and news client==\n[[Image:Mozilla Thunderbird logo history.png|300px|thumb|right|Various logos used during the development of Thunderbird]]\n\nSignificant work on Thunderbird restarted with the announcement that from version 1.5 onwards, the main Mozilla suite would be designed around separate applications using this new toolkit. This contrasts with the previous all-in-one approach, and will hopefully lead to more efficient and maintainable code, as well as allowing users to mix and match the Mozilla applications with alternatives.\n\nThe original Thunderbird logo was just a modified Firebird logo, with a simple shifting of [[hue]] value from red to blue. In 2004, together with the change of Firefox's [[mascot|visual identity]] by Jon Hicks, a more professional logo that is currently in use [http:\/\/www.hicksdesign.co.uk\/journal\/thunderbird was introduced].\n\n==Release history==\n{{Timeline Mozilla Thunderbird}}\n\n'''Color chart'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Lightning is just a project name, not a product name. Lightning 0.1 was released on March 14, 2006. The current version is 2.6, as at Thunderbird 24.01 release.\n\nOn October 11, 2006, Qualcomm and the Mozilla Foundation [http:\/\/www.eudora.com\/press\/2006\/eudora-mozilla_final_10.11.06.html announced] that \"future versions of [[Eudora (e-mail client)|Eudora]] will be based upon the same technology platform as the open source Mozilla Thunderbird email program.\" The project is code-named [https:\/\/wiki.mozilla.org\/Penelope Penelope]. An unofficial [http:\/\/emailman.newsgrouphosting.com\/emailman.software.clients.eudora.penelope Eudora\/Penelope forum] is accessible via web or newsreader.\n\nOn July 26, 2007, the [[Mozilla Foundation]] announced that Thunderbird would be developed by an independent organization, because the [[Mozilla Corporation]] (the for profit portion of Mozilla) is focusing on Mozilla Firefox development. This change was made in order to stimulate development in Thunderbird, which was being neglected during the Mozilla focus on [[Mozilla Firefox|Firefox]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Thomas |last=Claburn |title=Mozilla Gives Thunderbird E-Mail The Boot |url=http:\/\/www.informationweek.com\/story\/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=201201609 |work=Internet section |publisher=[[InformationWeek]] |date=27 July 2007 |accessdate=2007-07-31 }}<\/ref>\n\nOn September 17, 2007, the [[Mozilla Foundation]] announced the funding of a new internet communications initiative with Dr. David Ascher of ActiveState. The purpose of this initiative is \"to develop Internet communications software based on the Thunderbird product, code and brand\".\n\nOn February 19, 2008, [[Mozilla Messaging]] started operations as a subsidiary of the Mozilla Foundation responsible for the development of email and similar communications. Its initial focus was on the next major version, Thunderbird 3.0, which was released on December 8, 2009.\n\nOn July 6, 2012, the [[Mozilla Foundation]] announced that while they will no longer be focused on innovations for Thunderbird, they would provide support until the second half of 2013. In addition, future Thunderbird development will be transitioned to a community-driven model.<ref>http:\/\/blog.mozilla.org\/beyond-the-code\/2012\/07\/09\/about-the-future-of-thunderbird\/<\/ref>\t\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Free software}}\n* [[History of Mozilla Application Suite]]\n* [[History of Free Software]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https:\/\/wiki.mozilla.org\/Releases Mozilla release schedule for recent and upcoming versions of Thunderbird and Firefox]\n* [http:\/\/www.mozillamessaging.com\/en-US\/thunderbird\/releases\/ Thunderbird release notes for each version]\n* [http:\/\/releases.mozilla.org\/pub\/mozilla.org\/thunderbird\/releases\/ Downloadable versions of Thunderbird from OSUOSL]\n* [http:\/\/www.rumblingedge.com\/2005\/06\/05\/thunderbird-release-changelogs\/ The Rumbling Edge: Thunderbird release changelogs]\n* [http:\/\/www.hicksdesign.co.uk\/journal\/thunderbird\/ Jon Hicks describing the process of making Mozilla Thunderbird's logo]\n\n{{FOSS}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Mozilla Thunderbird}}\n[[Category:Mozilla Thunderbird]]\n[[Category:History of free and open-source software|Thunderbird]]\n[[Category:History of software|Mozilla Thunderbird]]\n[[Category:Software version histories|Mozilla Thunderbird]]","timestamp":"20160410102927","user-timestamp":"20150410102927"},{"title":"Talk:List of shows on SEN","content":"\n{| class=\"messagebox standard-talk\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| width=\"48px\" | [[File:Evolution-tasks2.png|35px|Articles for deletion]] || This article was nominated for [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|deletion]] {{#if:5 November 2006|on 5 November 2006|recently}}.

Originally headquartered in New York City, C-E moved its corporate offices to [[Stamford, Connecticut]] in 1973.  C-E owned over three dozen other companies including Lummus Company, National Tank Company and the Morgan Door Company.  Former workers have gone on to hold leadership positions in major engineering firms and governments around the world. The company was acquired by [[Asea Brown Boveri]] in early 1990.<ref>{{cite news | url=http:\/\/www.abb.com\/cawp\/abbzh252\/c2db8bbe34ab0961c1256aed003368b8.aspx| title=The ABB Group: Timeline}}<\/ref> The boiler and fossil fuel businesses were purchased by [[Alstom]] in 2000,<ref>{{cite news | url=http:\/\/www.power.alstom.com\/home\/Research___Development\/Power_Plant_Laboratories\/Services\/Combustion_Testing_and_Analysis\/Boiler_Simulation_Facility\/7224.EN.php?languageId=EN&dir=\/home\/Research___Development\/Power_Plant_Laboratories\/Services\/Combustion_Testing_and_Analysis\/Boiler_Simulation_Facility\/| title=Alstom - Power Plant Laboratories; Windsor, CT}}<\/ref> and the nuclear business was purchased by [[Westinghouse Electric Company]] also in 2000.<ref>{{cite news | url=http:\/\/www.westinghousenuclear.com\/Our_Company\/history\/Timeline\/1980_2003.shtm| title=Westinghouse Nuclear: Timeline}}<\/ref>\n\n==History<ref>{{cite book |last=Singer |first=Joseph G |title=Combustion Fossil Power |publisher=Combustion Engineering, Inc. |location=Windsor, Connecticut |isbn=0-9605974-0-9 |pages=I\u20131 &ndash; I\u20136}}<\/ref>==\n[[File:Welders making boilers for a ship, Combustion Engineering Co, Chattanooga, Tenn.jpg|thumb|Welders making boilers for a ship, Combustion Engineering Co, Chattanooga, Tenn. (1942)]]\n[[File:Maintenance man at the Combustion Engineering Co working at the largest cold steel hydraulic press in the world, Chattanooga, Tenn.jpg|thumb|Maintenance man at the Combustion Engineering Co working at the largest cold steel hydraulic press in the world, Chattanooga, Tenn. (1942)]]\n\n===Founding===\n\nCombustion Engineering was organized in 1912 through the merger of the Grieve Grate Company and the American Stoker Company, two well-known manufacturers of fuel burning equipment. The company was originally headquartered on 11 [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] and at 43 ''-'' 5 ''-'' 7 [[Broad Street (Manhattan)]], both in [[Lower Manhattan]].\nThe city block was leased from the Alliance Realty Company in April 1920. In May of the same year the firm began construction of an eight story office building on the same site.<ref>''Alliance Realty Makes $3,000,000 Lease'', [[Wall Street Journal]], April 20, 1920, pg. 10.<\/ref>\n\nDuring the 1920s, C-E's signature boiler equipment was the English designed Type-E [[Boiler#Stoker Fired Boilers|stoker]]. C-E also offered several other types of underfeed stokers in addition to the Type-E. During the 1920s, all of C-E's stokers were fabricated in manufacturing plants along the [[Monongahela River]] south of [[Pittsburgh]].\n\nIn 1925 C-E entered the [[boiler|steam boiler]] business, beginning with a steam boiler installed at the [[Ford Motor Company|Ford Motor Company's]] [[River Rouge Plant]] in [[Dearborn, MI]]. C-E also acquired two boiler companies in [[Chattanooga, TN]] to augment its manufacturing capabilities.\n\n===Merger with the Superheater Company===\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], C-E formed a partnership with the Superheater Company. The Locomotive Superheater Company was founded in 1910 to further the use of [[superheater|superheated steam]] in [[Steam locomotive|locomotives]]. The Superheater Company's primary manufacturing facility was located in [[East Chicago, Indiana]].\n \nIn December 1948 stockholders approved a merger between the Combustion Engineering Company and Superheater Company. Following consolidation the corporation was called Combustion Engineering-Superheater Inc.<ref>''Merger of Combustion Engineering Co. With Superheater Approved'', Wall Street Journal, December 23, 1948, pg. 5.<\/ref> In September 1950 the firm announced plans to build a large high-pressure generating unit for [[Virginia Electric & Power Company]] in [[Chester, Virginia]].<ref>''Combustion Engineering To Build New Generator For Virginia Electric'', Wall Street Journal, September 21, 1950, pg. 8.<\/ref>\n\nIn 1953, the name Superheater was eliminated and the company took the more familiar name - Combustion Engineering, Inc. At this time, C-E primarily designed and built [[boiler|boiler assemblies]] for [[Power station|conventional power plants]]; those powered by [[coal]] and [[oil]].\n\nIn the mid-1950s, C-E also expanded its operations into oil and gas exploration, production, refining, and [[petrochemicals]] with the acquisition of the Lummus Company located in [[Bloomfield, NJ]].  Lummus also supplied small industrial steam supply systems for oil field enhanced recovery.\n\nC-E was one of the major suppliers of [[Water-tube boiler|boiler]]s for [[United States Navy|US Navy]] [[steam turbine|steam-powered]] warships, including \"Liberty Ships\" during World War II.   Amongst many other warships, all of the 46 [[Knox class frigate]]s built during the 1960s and 1970s were equipped with a 1200 [[Pound-force per square inch|PSI]] C-E power plant.\n\nC-E also was a leader in the development of large coal utility steam supply systems which were used worldwide.  C-E pioneered the tangential firing process used in modern large pulverized coal utility boilers.  C-E maintained a large coal burning test unit at the Windsor, Connecticut site which allowed the Power Systems Group to test changes to boiler air-flow and other critical boiler design factors.\n\n=== Growth of Nuclear Steam Supply Systems ===\n\nC-E's [[nuclear power]] activity began in 1955 under Arthur Santry Jr. The history of the C-E Windsor, Connecticut campus dates to the early development of the [[nuclear submarine]]. From the mid-1950s through the early 1960s, Combustion Engineering, under federal government contract, produced nuclear fuel for [[Nuclear Navy|U.S. Navy]] nuclear submarines. Also located at the Windsor site was the prototype marine [[nuclear propulsion]] training facility known as [[S1C reactor|S1C]], which was designed and constructed by C-E adjacent to its main campus. The S1C prototype was operated by C-E for more than 10 years as an [[R&D]] and Naval training facility. After expiration of C-E's contract, the S1C contract was subsequently awarded to [[Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory]] (KAPL), who operated the unit until its decommissioning and dismantlement in the late 1990s and early 2000s.<ref>{{cite news | url=http:\/\/www.courant.com\/business\/hc-nuke0928.artsep28,0,2887020.story| title=Radioactive Cleanup of former Combustion Engineering Site | author=Mark Peters | date=September 28, 2007 | publisher=[[Hartford Courant]]}}<\/ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, C-E began selling [[nuclear power]] steam supply systems.  The first commercial nuclear steam supply system was sold to [[Consumers Power Company]] of Michigan for the [[Palisades Nuclear Generating Station]], which is still in operation. C-E competed aggressively with [[General Electric]] and [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]] in this domain.\n\nIn the late 1960s the company supplied nuclear reactor systems and fabricated [[uranium]] fuel for [[electric utility]] companies. A joint venture was announced in April 1968, involving the Combustion Engineering Company, [[Houston Natural Gas]], and Ranchers Exploration & Development Corporation. The three businesses combined to search for uranium on {{convert|250000|acre|km2}} in [[New Mexico]].<ref>''Combustion Engineering To Join 2 Other Firms In a Hunt for Uranium'', Wall Street Journal, April 5, 1968, pg. 22.<\/ref>\n\nC-E was generally credited with a superior design, evidenced by the fact that the [[megawatt]] yield of its [[nuclear reactor]]s was typically about 10% higher than that of comparable Westinghouse plants.  The basis for this increase in efficiency was a computer-based system called the Core Operating Limit Supervisory System (COLSS), which leveraged almost 300 in-core [[neutron detector]]s and a patented [[algorithm]] to allow higher [[Power-to-weight ratio|power densities]].  {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  Combustion also fabricated a number of the Westinghouse reactor vessels and steam generators at its Chattanooga manufacturing facility under contracts with the Westinghouse company.\n\nC-E maintined a sophisticated nuclear reactor operator training simulator at the Windsor facility for support for customers of its nuclear steam supply systems.\n\n=== Company Structure & Organization ===\n\nIn the 1960s, and continuing through 1988, C-E acquired a number of companies, many not directly related to the core utility steam supply business.  As a result, the company structure evolved so that it had five and later six major business groups or divisions.  C-E Power Systems comprised the original utility steam supply components, C-E Industrial Group, C-E Lummus & Engineering Services Group, C-E Refractories & Minerals Group, C-E Oil & Gas Group, and last C-E Instrumentation & Controls Group were formed to provide management focus as the company and its products base expanded.  The Power Systems Division included the original major manufacturing facilities at Chattanooga, St. Louis, Monongahela, Birmingham; and in Canada, Brantford, Cornwall, and Upper Canada Manufacturing.  A number of companies were acquired or developed and added to the division including, American Pole Structures, C-E Controls, the P.F. Avery Co., C-E Impel, C-E Maguire (Charles A. Maguire & Associates) and C-E Metals (primarily a specialty scrap metal operation in Chattanooga); and was basically divided into three major sub-groups: Fossil, Nuclear, and Services (which included field erection, aftermarket spare parts, and engineering services). The Industrial Group included C-E Industrial Boiler (part of the original base of CE in East Chicago, IN and Detroit & Saginaw, MI), C-E Bauer (Pulp & Paper Equipment), C-E Raymond (Crushing and Conveying Equipment), C-E Air Preheater (exclusive U.S. use of Ljungstr\u00f6m technology), C-E Tyler Screening (Industrial Wire Screens), C-E Ehrsham (Conveyors & Grain Elevators). C-E Enterprise Manufacturing, C-E Tyler Elevator, CERREY, and other industrial supply companies.  The Oil & Gas Group included such companies as C-E Natco, C-E Grey Tool, Beaumont Well Works, C-E Vetco, OilField Engineering, C-E Houston Forging, etc.  The Refractories & Minerals Group included C-E Minerals, C-E Refractories, C-E Cast Industrial Products, C-E Building Products (C-E Aluminum Building Products, C-E Morgan, C-E Stanley Artex), Georgia Kaolin, Pryor-Giggey, C-E Transport, C-E Glass, C-E Hordis Bros. Glass, etc.  The Instrumentation & Controls group included C-E Taylor Instruments, C-E Resource Recovery Systems, C-E Process Analytics (acquired from Bendix), etc.  Each group had a separate headquarters and support staff which coordinated each group's companies actions with the C-E Corporate support functions of Administration, Information Systems, Insurance, Treasury, Accounting, Audit, and Personnel.\n\nC-E had a large presence in Canada, including fossil and nuclear steam supply manufacturing facilities.  A number of the Industrial Group companies had manufacturing facilities there as well, primarily located in the province of Ontario.  The Oil & Gas Group had operations in the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.  C-E maintained offices as well as a number of manufacturing sites on a worldwide basis, including the UK, Ireland, Austria, Germany, Italy, South Africa, Belgium, Mexico and France.  C-E's technology on a wide range of products was licensed worldwide.\n\n=== Leadership & Management ===\n\nFor much of the existence of the company, the Santry family controlled the management of C-E.  Joseph Santry was President of the company until 1963.  Arthur Santry, Jr., Joseph's nephew, was named President in 1963 and Chairman of the C-E Board of Directors in 1982 and held both titles until he resigned his post as President in 1984.

From 1785 to 1790 he was the [[Poet Laureate]] of England. He is sometimes called ''Thomas Warton the younger'' to distinguish him from his father ''[[Thomas Warton the elder]]''.  His most famous poem remains ''The Pleasures of Melancholy'', a representative work of the [[Graveyard poets]].\n\n==Life==\n\nWarton was born in [[Basingstoke]], [[Hampshire]], the son of poet [[Thomas Warton, the Elder]], and younger brother of [[Joseph Warton]]. As a youngster, Warton demonstrated a strong predilection toward writing poetry, a skill he would continue to develop all of his life.<ref name=\"life\">[http:\/\/caxton.stockton.edu\/pom\/stories\/storyReader$8 Life of Thomas Warton, the Younger]\n<\/ref> In fact, Warton translated one of [[Martial]]'s epigrams at nine, and wrote ''The Pleasures of Melancholy'' at seventeen.\n\nHis early education was given to him by his father. At sixteen years of age he enrolled at [[Winchester College]], later moving to [[Trinity College, Oxford]]. He graduated from Oxford in 1747, where he subsequently became a Fellow. Warton was selected as Poet Laureate of Oxford in 1747 and again in 1748. His duty in this post was to write a poem about a selected patroness of the University, which would be read to her on a specially appointed day.<ref name=\"life\"\/>\n{{The Club|align=right|size=180px}}\n\nWarton was appointed [[Professor of Poetry]] at the university in 1757, a post that he held for ten years.<ref>\"<cite>He was ordained and eventually served as professor of poetry at Oxford from 1757 to 1767.<\/cite>\" [http:\/\/www.bartleby.com\/65\/wa\/Warton-T2.html Warton, Thomas, 1728\u201390, English poet and literary historian]<\/ref>\n\nIn 1771 he was appointed rector of [[Kiddington]] in Oxfordshire, a post he held until his death.\n\nIn 1785, he was appointed [[Camden Professor of History]], as well as poet laureate. He was a friend and rival of [[Samuel Johnson]], and his poetry was greatly influenced by earlier English poets such as Chaucer, Drayton, Fairfax, and Spenser.\n\nAmong other important contributions, Warton, along with his brother, was among the first to argue that ''Sir Thopas'', by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], was a parody. Warton contributed to the general project of the [[ballad]] revival. He was a general supporter of the poetry of [[Thomas Gray]]&mdash;a fact that Johnson satirized in his parody \"Hermit hoar, in solemn cell.\"  Among his minor works were an edition of [[Theocritus]], a selection of Latin and Greek inscriptions, the humorous ''Oxford Companion to the Guide and Guide to the Companion'' (1762); lives of [[Sir Thomas Pope]] and [[Ralph Bathurst]]; and an ''Inquiry into the Authenticity of the Poems attributed to Thomas Rowley'' (1782).\n\n==Poetry, criticism and historical works==\n\nIn 1749, Warton penned ''The Triumph of Isis'', a poem in praise of Oxford and the many students who had received their education there. Published anonymously, ''The Triumph of Isis'' rebutted [[William Mason (poet)|William Mason\u2019s]] Isis, an Elegy published the previous year, which was anything but flattering to Oxford.<ref name=\"life\"\/>\n\nFollowing the success of ''The Triumph of Isis'', Warton wrote ''Newmarket, a Satire'', which was followed by a collection of verses. His complete poetical works were included in an anthology that has been reissued.<ref>[http:\/\/www.poetryconnection.net\/1154891224\/The_Poetical_Works_of_Thomas_Gray_Thomas_Parnell_William_Collins_Matthew_Green_and_Thomas_Warton.html  General Books LLC ISBN 1-154-89122-4, reissue of ''The Poetical Works of Thomas Gray, Thomas Parnell, William Collins, Matthew Green, and Thomas Warton'', Routledge, 1853, London] by [[Robert Aris Willmott]].<\/ref>\n\nWarton's first major academic work was ''Observations on the [[The Faerie Queene|Faerie Queene]] of [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]]'', published in 1754. He is, however, best known for the three-volume ''[[The History of English Poetry]]'' (1774\u201381), which covered the poetry of the 11th through the 16th centuries. Although the work was criticized for its many inaccuracies, it is nonetheless considered a highly important and influential historical tome.\n\nIn 1782 he wrote ''The History and Antiquities of Kiddington'', an early example of [[English local history]].<ref>Warton, T. ''The History and Antiquities of Kiddington''. 3rd edition (1815) in [http:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=oFdbAAAAQAAJ&printsec=titlepage Google Books]<\/ref>\n\nAs a poet, Warton was more inclined toward light and humorous verse, odes and sonnets. His sonnets helped to revive the form, which had fallen out of fashion.\n\nHe is remembered for his interest in primitivism, which was an important stage toward romanticism.\n\n==A sonnet by Warton==\n\n{| align=center cellpadding=5px cellspacing=0 border=0\n|\n::::'''''To the River Lodon'''''{{Ref label|A|a|none}}\n|-\n|\nAh! what a weary race my feet have run<br \/>\nSince first I trod thy banks with alders crowned, <br \/>\nAnd thought my way was all thro' fairy ground, <br \/>\nBeneath thy azure sky and golden sun;<br \/>\nWhere first my muse to lisp her notes begun! <br \/>\nWhile pensive Memory traces back the round, <br \/>\nWhich fills the varied interval between;<br \/>\nMuch pleasure, more of sorrow, marks the scene. <br \/>\nSweet native stream! those skies and suns so pure <br \/>\nNo more return, to cheer my evening road! <br \/>\nYet still one joy remains, that, not obscure, <br \/>\nNor useless, all my vacant days have flowed,<br \/>\nFrom youth's gay dawn to manhood's prime mature; <br \/>\nNor with the muse's laurel unbestowed.<br \/>\n| valign=bottom |<ref>[[Chambers' Book of Days]] [http:\/\/www.thebookofdays.com\/months\/may\/21.htm 21 May]<\/ref>\n|}\n\n==Various works==\n*{{Cite book |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Pleasures of Melancholy  |url=http:\/\/loki.stockton.edu\/~kinsellt\/projects\/pom\/pom.html |date= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages= }}\n*{{Cite book |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Observations on the Faerie Queene of Spenser |year=1754 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages= }}\n*{{Cite book |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Oxford Sausage |year=1764 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages= }} \u2013 an anthology of verse and Oxford wit\n*{{Cite book |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Inquiry into the Authenticity of the Rowley Poems |year=1770 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages= }}\n*{{Cite book |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=[[The History of English Poetry|History of English Poetry]] |date=1774\u201381 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages= }}\n*{{Cite book |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The History and Antiquities of Kiddington |year=1782 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages= }}\n\n== Notes ==\n'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}}The [[River Lodon]] referred to by Warton is the stream running through the Parsonage House of his childhood, in Basingstoke.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gilfillan|first=Rev.

Deaf children produce [[baby babble]] and mistakes like a hearing child would. DoDP mistakenly produces the [http:\/\/www.signingsavvy.com\/sign\/MOTHER\/274\/1 sign for mother] with the misuse of handshape, similar to how a hearing child might mispronounce a word. DoDP have higher average lexical size than hearing children before the age of 18 months.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lederberg|first=Amy R|coauthors=Schick, Spencer|title=Language and literacy development of deaf and hard-of-hearing children: Successes and challenges|journal=Journal of Developmental Psychology|date=2013|volume=49|pages=<!--15-->30}}<\/ref>  Although, hearing children catch up at around 24 months. DoDP have a sudden increase in learning new vocabulary at 16 to 19 months of age, when their lexicons reach about 50 signs. Compared to hearing children, DoDP learn proportionally more action, adverb, and personal social words.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lederberg|first=Amy R|coauthors=Schick, Spencer|title=Language and literacy development of deaf and hard-of-hearing children: Successes and challenges|journal=Journal of Developmental Psychology|date=2013|volume=49|pages=<!--15-->30}}<\/ref>  Development of pointing, that occurs in typical developing children, becomes beneficial and advantageous to DoDP because this gesture soon becomes part of their [[linguistic system]] in Sign Language. Around 17 to 20 months pointing takes on the role of pronouns in Sign Language. Signs appear slightly earlier in DoDP, than vocal words in hearing children, suggesting earlier communication development with acquisition of Sign Language. \n\nLiteracy development for DoDP is closely related to loan signs and fingerspelling in [[American Sign Language]] (ASL). [[Fingerspelling]] is an equalvilant representation to the manual English alphabet, in signs. Loan signs are clusters of common [[affixes]] or spelt words that are signed fast enough that they become a sign in itself, such as \u2013tion or - ness. Fingerspelling and loan signs in ASL help replace the auditory phonological input that DoDP lack. Strong correlation between fingerspelling skills and English reading vocabulary have been found for DoDP. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Lederberg|first=Amy R|coauthors=Schick, Spencer|title=Language and literacy development of deaf and hard-of-hearing children: Successes and challenges|journal=Journal of Developmental Psychology|date=2013|volume=49|pages=<!--15-->30}}<\/ref>\n\n\n==== '''Deaf Children Born to Hearing Parents[edit]''' ====\n(I expanded under this heading)\n\nDeaf children born to hearing parents (DoHP) usually have restricted or late onset exposure to Sign Language. They are highly likely to miss the [[critical period]] for acquisition of a first language and late exposure can results in severe [[Language delay|language-delayed]]. However, the critical period seems to only affect first language because adults who [[Hearing loss|lost their hearing]] in late childhood become fluent in Sign Language as their second language. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Lederberg|first=Amy R|coauthors=Schick, Spencer|title=Language and literacy development of deaf and hard-of-hearing children: Successes and challenges|journal=Journal of Developmental Psychology|date=2013|volume=49|pages=<!--15-->30}}<\/ref>\n\n==== '''Simultaneous Communication''' ==== \n(I created this heading)\n\n[[Simultaneous Communication]] (SimCom) is the use of both signing language and spoken language at the same time. Sign language and spoken languages have different grammar and [[syntax]] so when SimCom is used, the grammar, syntax and word order of the spoken language is used in the signing. SimCom can cause Sign Language's grammar and syntax to disappear. In the United States, SimCom environments have decreased by 15% since 2008. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Lederberg|first=Amy R|coauthors=Schick, Spencer|title=Language and literacy development of deaf and hard-of-hearing children: Successes and challenges|journal=Journal of Developmental Psychology|date=2013|volume=49|pages=<!--15-->30}}<\/ref> Deaf children learning through the SimCom Model have severely low vocabulary development compared to DoDP and hearing children. SimCom is commonly used for [[Oralism|oral-environments]] with Deaf children with hearing aids or [[cochlear implants]]. The use of speech when signing helps Deaf children become exposed to the auditory cues in the [[semantics]] and syntax of the spoken language, but still have visual support. SimCom not only causes vocabulary and cognitive development delays, but also causes controversy about [[Deaf Culture]]. DoHP usually have SimCom input, at the beginning stages of their lives, and as they get older and the model then turns into just spoken language. Hearing parents usually do not supply sufficient signing input for optimal language development for their Deaf children. Although, SimCom does provide better vocabulary development then Deaf children who are only exposed to spoken language. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Lederberg|first=Amy R|coauthors=Schick, Spencer|title=Language and literacy development of deaf and hard-of-hearing children: Successes and challenges|journal=Journal of Developmental Psychology|date=2013|volume=49|pages=<!--15-->30}}<\/ref>\n\n\n=== '''Memory''' ===\n(I created this heading)\n\n[[Working memory]] is a important area in children's memory process for learning. Deaf children are better at attending to and processing information in their [[peripheral vision]] than hearing peers due to their visual communication. Distractions from heightened peripheral vision can be problematic because attention can be hindered when placed in a classroom setting, especially if focused attention on a teacher or interpreter is required. Deaf children are found to equal hearing children in [[Free recall|free recall]] (recalling a list in any other) memory skill. However, in [[visuospatial]] recall (items presented in a visual array) Deaf children perform better. Hearing children perform better when items are shown and then disappeared before the next item appears (are in movement). Deaf children seem to perform best when information is presented in still visuospatial format. This could be an important aspect in relaying information when concerning [[Deaf education]]. Deaf children may have trouble developing [[working memory]] when informational load is too overwhelming. Suggestion of rehearsing and performing nursery rhymes, can improve Deaf children's sequential working memory skills and language processing skills. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Hamilton|first=Harley|title=Memory Skills of Deaf Learners: Implication and Application|journal=American Annals of the Deaf|date=2011|volume=156|pages=<!--402-->423}}<\/ref>\n\n== TellaTouch == \n(I created a new page for defining TellaTouch)\n\nThe TellaTouch is a communicational device that aids [[Deafblind]] people to communicate with one another. It was developed by the [[American Foundation for the Blind]] research laboratory. In the mid 1940s, it was a major aid for the Deafblind community and removed many Deafblind adults and children out of isolation. Now, [[tactile sign language]] is a more efficient way of Deafblind communication. TellaTouch has a full [[QWERTY keyboard]], a [[Braille Keyboard|full Braille keyboard]] with a 6 single dot mechanical cell. The participant receiving the information must know braille. <ref>{{cite web|title=TellaTouch Is Back!|url=http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/ouch\/messageboards\/NF3611783?thread=2687990|publisher=BBC News}}<\/ref> <ref>{{cite book|last=Committee on Prosthetics Research and Development|title=Communication and Sensory Aids for the Deaf-blind: Report of a Workshop|date=1975|publisher=National Center for Deaf-Blind Youths and Adults}}<\/ref> They place their fingers on the single dot mechanical cells which raise up, whilst the participant relaying the information types.

These are held in the binder by circular or D-shaped retainers, onto which the contents are threaded. The rings are usually spring-loaded, but can also be secured by lever arch<ref>{{Cite web|title = Lever Arch Mechanisms :: RING ALLIANCE|url = http:\/\/www.ring-alliance.com\/02_en_leverarchmechanisms.php|website = www.ring-alliance.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}<\/ref> mechanisms or other securing systems. The binders themselves are typically made from plastic with metal rings. Early designs were patented during the early 1890s to the early 1900s.\n\n==History==\nGerman [[Friedrich Soennecken]] invented ring binders in 1886 in [[Bonn]], [[Germany]]. He also registered a patent on November 14, 1886, for his ''Papierlocher f\u00fcr Sammelmappen'' (\"paper hole maker for folders\", or [[hole punch]]). German [[Louis Leitz]], founder of [[Esselte Leitz GmbH & Co KG|Leitz]] later made some important changes in development of ring binders in [[Stuttgart-Feuerbach]]. Leitz introduced the \"finger hole\" on the side of the binder to aid removal from crowded shelves.\n\nThe [[ISO standard]] two holes are {{convert|80|mm|in}} apart, according to [[Hole punch#ISO 838|ISO&nbsp;838]]. The four-hole version has no ISO standard. The distances between holes are {{convert|80|mm|in}} (3\u00d78).\n\nAnother design for ring binders was invented in 1889 by Andreas Tengwall in [[Helsingborg]], [[Sweden]], and patented in 1890 under the name 'Trio binder', named after a business consortium of Tengwall and two associates. Tengwall's design uses four rings, in two paired sets. The hole placement of Tengwall's Trio binder is still used as a [[de facto standard]] for hole punching in Sweden under the name ''trioh\u00e5lning''. These holes are {{convert|21|mm|in}}, {{convert|70|mm|in}},  and {{convert|21|mm|in}} apart. (In [http:\/\/www.officemuseum.com\/filing_equipment_small.htm this] article, it makes mention that, according to the curator of the Early Office Museum in London, the first patent for ring binders was filed in 1859 for a two-ring binder. A few years later three-ring binders became the standard in the United States; the \"D\" ring binders did not come on the market there until the 1940s or 1950s.)\n\nWilliam P. Pitt obtained [http:\/\/www.google.com\/patents\/US778070 patent no. 778070] on December 20, 1904 for a 3-ring binder that became a standard in the United States. The North American de facto standard spacing is {{convert|4.25|in|mm}} between holes.\n\n==Variations==\nBinders come in many standard sizes with respect to both capacity and [[paper size]]. Most countries use a two- or four-hole system for holding [[A4 paper size|A4]] sheets.\n\nThe most common type in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] is a three-ring system for [[Letter (paper size)|letter size pages]] ({{frac|8|1|2}} inches \u00d7 11 inches). A standard {{frac|8|1|2}} inch \u00d7 11 inch sheet of paper has three holes with spacing of {{frac|4|1|4}} inches (107.95&nbsp;mm). \"Ledger\" size binders hold {{convert|11|by|17|in|cm|adj=on}} paper, and may use standard 3-ring spacing or multiple additional rings.\n\nThe distance from the punched holes to the nearest edge of the paper is less critical, since small differences do not affect the compatibility of paper and binder.  Typical distance from the paper edge to the center of the hole is {{convert|0.5|in|mm}}, and typical diameter of the hole ranges from {{convert|0.25|in|mm}} to {{convert|0.31|in|mm}} in North American usage.\n\nMore extensive coverage of official and [[de facto standard]]s for punched holes can be found in the article [[Hole punch]].\n\nThe lever arch system is helpful when wanting to hold large amounts of paper into a small, easy to carry around folder.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Lever Arch Insert Binders - Aspire Office Products|url = http:\/\/aspireofficeproducts.com.au\/lever-arch-insert-binders.html|website = aspireofficeproducts.com.au|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}<\/ref>\n\nMany [[personal organizer]]s and [[memorandum]] books use a six- or seven-hole system, including [[Filofax]], the [[FranklinCovey]], and [http:\/\/www.daytimer.com\/daytimer\/browse\/product\/Sophisticated+Vinyl+Binder+Starter+Set+Portable+Size+(4508)\/4508 Day-Timer\u00ae].  Most systems have the rings on the left side of the papers as one opens the binder, but there are also binders that have the rings (concealed by the binder cover) at the top edge of the paper, reminiscent of a clipboard.\n\nMost binder covers are made of three pieces, in the fashion of a [[hardback book]], but are produced in many styles. Materials vary widely. Some [[vinyl]] binders have a clear pocket on the outside for [[Book cover|cover pages]], and many have pockets in the inner cover for loose papers, [[business cards]], [[compact disc]]s, etc. There are also zipper binders, which zip the binder up and keep papers from falling out. Some binders are stored in matching [[slipcase]]s for greater protection; either with one slipcase per each binder, or one slipcase holding several binders.\n\nIt is also possible to insert the sheet of paper into a [[polypropylene]] [[sheet protector]]. The sheet protector already has pre-punched holes, so the document can be kept untouched and unwrinkled.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery style=\"text-align:center\">\nFile:Ordner dicht en open.jpg|Two-ring binders, in open (right) and closed (left) positions\nFile:Three ring binder.JPG|Three-ring binder, open\nFile:Storex3RingBinder.jpg|Storex's three-ring binders, closed\nFile:Gaffelparm.jpg|Tengwall's four-ring \"fork\" binder, open\n<\/gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hole punch]]\n* [[Punched pocket]]\n* [[Loose leaf]]\n* [[Notebook]]\n* [[Springback binder]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commons category inline|Ring binders}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ring Binder}}\n[[Category:German inventions]]\n[[Category:Notebooks]]\n[[Category:Office equipment]]\n[[Category:Stationery]]\n[[Category:Swedish inventions]]","timestamp":"20160410102940","user-timestamp":"20150410102940"},{"title":"User talk:92.55.10.183","content":"== Welcome! ==\n\nHello, and [[Wikipedia:Introduction|welcome to Wikipedia]]!

[[User:Talldean|Dean]] 18:43, 26 March 2007 (UTC)\n:Actually, I kind of object to the phrase \"One of the Ruger rimfire pistols' most prominent flaws\", since it implies that the pistol has many prominent flaws.

[[User:Talldean|Dean]] 18:49, 26 March 2007 (UTC)\n\n::I think that section can probably be yanked--the Ruger's are are not unreliable, they're about as reliable as an autoloader gets in .22 LR.  For example:\n:: My suggestion for the beginner looking for an entry-level pistol is to consider the Ruger Mark II. Its accuracy is excellent and its reliability is second to none. Its only flaw is that its trigger action as it comes from the factory, is usually criticized as long and sloppy and merits an inexpensive trigger job.\n::from http:\/\/bullseyepistol.com\/equipmnt.htm.

Voila!  Success on the first attempt.  The very tricky procedure for properly engaging the hammer strut with the mainstring assembly was clearly explained and captured in excellent photographs.  Thanks for very helpful and clear instruction.\n[[User:Bbcards46|Bbcards46]] ([[User talk:Bbcards46|talk]]) 21:38, 2 March 2008 (UTC)\n\n:Yeah, it that angle is pretty critical.  My first experience was actually with my mother's 5 digit serial # one, made back when it didn't even have a model name.  Someone had borrowed it, and tried to clean it, and returned the parts in a bag.  I had never see it apart before, and it took about an hour of fiddling to get a good grasp of what was going on inside before I figured out how to get the hammer strut positioned just right over the mainspring.  Since then, I've talked a bunch of people through the process.  Once you know what the problem is, it's easy to get back together.  [[User:Fluzwup|scot]] ([[User talk:Fluzwup|talk]]) 15:24, 3 March 2008 (UTC)\n\n== Cleaning\/Maintenance ==\nSomeone added that the Mark II needs to be cleaned quite often to remain reliable.  I'm going to have to disagree, as I've seen folks *never* clean their Mark II, save to q-tip enough gunk out so that the bolt fully closes without a problem.  Thoughts?

Yaw Osafo-Maafo.A vibrant MP for Akim Oda in Ghana West Africa.\nWith a solid educational background and the high level of competence which characterizes the career of Honorable Yaw Osafo-Maafo (MP for Akim Oda and a two time minister of the Kufuor Administration), the honorable minister has over the years demonstrated his capabilities for the top job of PRESIDENCY.\n\nIndeed the Honorable Mp\u2019s good sense of judgment coupled with his strong respect for the rule of law has made him very popular and acceptable across all sections of the society. This fundamental acceptance further stems from his strong sense of know-how which he applies to his job through humility and tact.\n\nThis amongst others (which we will be outlining below) has gone into our unrelenting effort to rally behind none but the presidential candidacy of the Honorable Yaw Osafo-Maafo, MP in the run up to the 2008 presidential race. \n\nOn one hand, this is an expression of our interest to make the best choice for the mother party (New Patriotic Party) and on the other hand, to produce a President who has the foresight, the zeal and the charisma to serve mother Ghana as a whole.\n\nCURRENT STANCE \n\nThe honorable Yaw Osafo-Maafo is currently the Member of Parliament for the   Akim-Oda Constituency. He has been their representative in parliament since 1997. \n\nTHE SHAPING OF THE MAN \n\nBorn and raised in Ghana on the 24th of December, 1942, the Hon. Yaw Osafo-Maafo began his schooling at the Awisa Presby Boarding School. He continued at the Achimota School completing in 1963 and then moved to the now Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi where he studied and graduated with a Bsc in Mechanical Engineering. \n\nThe honorable Member of Parliament used the years after to accumulate knowledge which included the following;\n\n\nDiploma from Metal Engineering institute (Metallurgy) \u2013 USA\n\nCertificate in Management \u2013 American Management Association\n\nCertificate in Project Implementation and Follow-Up \u2013 UNIDO\n\nCertificate in Project Appraisals \u2013 UNIDO\n\nCertificate in Crisis Management \u2013 Economic Development Institute (EDI), World Bank\n\nCertificate in Financial Sector Restructuring \u2013 Economic Development Institute (EDI), World Bank\n\nCertificate in Education and Democracy \u2013 Les Aspin Centre for Government, Marqutee University, USA\n\n\nPOLITICAL ACHIEVEMENTS \n\nFinance & Economics \n\nThe Honorable Yaw Osafo-Maafo was appointed the first Finance Minister in the Positive Change Government of His Excellency, President J.A Kufuor. His program, amongst others enabled the NPP Government to slash down inflation, push up growth rates and boost spending to cut poverty. This success story is one that is still unfolding, with Ghana increasingly spoken of in the same breath as Africa's golden boy Uganda, with its highly successful development policies. \n\nGhana's achievements in this regard culminated from the quest for macroeconomic improvements under the able guide of Hon. Yaw Osafo-Maafo, who together with his team launched a program of reform that has to date attracted increasing attention from domestic and international sources. \n\nAt the ministry of finance, he was responsible for turning round the economy after a period of high inflation, high interest rates, an unsustainable external and domestic debt, and significant depreciation of the currency. \n\nDuring his tenure, the Hon. Yaw Osafo-Maafo saw to a level of transparency that was refreshingly high, his willingness to highlight problems was matched by a very practical step to tackling them. Without fear or favor, he undertook a far reaching program to combat fraud within the public sector. This move greatly paid off with the elimination of thousands of ghost names from Government payroll and more importantly culminated in the passing of the three Acts namely, the Public Procurement Act, Internal Audit Agency Act and the Financial Administration Acts\n\nOn the eve of adopting the HIPC initiative, Hon. Yaw Osafo Maafo promised a much quicker Completion Point. A point which was achieved as scheduled owing to the strict adherence to the tight fiscal and monetary policies. In July 2005, Ghana passed a milestone and became the 14th country to qualify for full debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) program.  A deal that saw creditors write off $3.5 billion of debt in nominal terms. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t therefore surprising that Ghana's debt of more than 1.644 billion US dollars owed the Paris Club, was cancelled upon reaching the completion point. Today funds ploughed back as a result of the initiative are going into the provision of basic infrastructural needs for the country. \n\nThe period among others saw the stabilization of the domestic currency after a period of significant depression against all major currencies. A drastic reduction in inflation from 40.5% in 2000 to 12.4% in July 2004\n\nOther notable achievements include \n\nIncrease in the tax revenue from CEDIS4.4 trillion in 2000 down to 12.4% in July 2004\n\n\nReduction in the average lending rates from 47.5% to 29.5% and the Bank of Ghana Prime rate from 24.5% in 2002 to 18% in July 2004\n\n\nCreation of medium term treasury market by creating 1 and 3 year treasury bills in addition to the existing 3 months treasury bills due to dramatic improvement in the stability of the economy\n\n\nRise in foreign exchange reserve from $233 million to $1.425.6 million\n\n\nNet domestic financing decreased from 1117.6 billion cedis to (1732.2) billion cedis\n\n\nOverall budget deficit reduced from 6.5% of GDP to 1.7% of GDP\n\n\nGhana qualified amongst the first nations in May 2004 to benefit from the Millennium \nChallenge Account instituted by the United States Government\n\n\nGranted independence to the central bank by law giving it the power to set interest rates and determine monetary policy\n\n\nImplemented policies in the cocoa sector which led to the highest yields ever in the cocoa sector. Output increased from 389,770 metric tones in the 2000\/2001 crop year to 667,732 metric tones by 2003\/2004 crop year\n\n\nFinancial sector reforms including the new banking law and other bills to modernize the legal framework for payment systems, the preparation of an insurance bill and draft bills on money laundering, insolvency and financial institutions\n\n\nAs a reflection of the general improvement of the economy, the daily national minimum wage increased between 2001 and 2004 by 267% (4,200 cedis to 11,200) and by dollar terms by 70% \nAll these great achievements led to the honorable Yaw Osafo-Maafo being named African minister of the year 2001 by the \u201cBanker Magazine\u201d a Financial Times Publication and the African Finance Minister of the year 2004 by the emerging Markets Newspaper (www.emergingmarkets.org), a World Bank and IMF meetings publications\n\n\u2026.it\u2019s very clear that Hon Yaw Osafo-Maafo is a real hands-on person with a successful track record in his various fields of endeavors which have brought him much honor and rewards. \n\nPOLITICAL ACHIEVEMENTS\n\nEducation and Sports\n\nIn the education and sports ministry, Yaw undertook major education sector reforms aimed at improving the quality of basic, secondary and tertiary education. The reforms also sought to align the education system with the needs of the broader economy. \n\nHe managed the take-off of a new national education reform program, focusing amongst other things on the development of the teaching of Math, Science and Information Communication Technology (ICT). \n\nHe was also instrumental in setting up a dedicated teacher training college for Math and science and ICT. Moreover, the honorable Yaw Osafo Maafo finalized the bill to parliament for the council for technical and vocational education training (COVET)\n\nDuring his period in office, he introduced the new distance education scheme for teachers to solve the perennial problem of teacher shortages due to large numbers of teachers taking study leave to attend full-time courses and also oversaw the implementation of the national Basic Schools and capitation Grant scheme, aimed at ensuring universal free basic education\n\n\u2018\u2018My dream is to lead Ghana to the World Cup\u201d \u2026Hon. Yaw Osafo-Maafo. As the Minister of Education and Sports, one of his main quests for sports as he indicated during his vetting in Parliament was to give Ghana its \u201cbiggest birthday cake\u201d, that is its qualification to the World Cup for the first time. He always believed that football like any other business will only succeed with a sound management foundation and the requisite sponsorship. \n\nAs a former Finance Minister, Yaw Osafo-Maafo knew that sports funding will be the least of the troubles of the current one. After all, the prime focus of every government will be on the social sector (thus education and health). The only way forward was to undertake a vigorous search for funding for the world cup campaign; this he did, leading his team to rake in the biggest sponsorship in our sporting history. \n\nWith funding came every level of preparation needed to stay in the competition; with funding came motivation in every sense of the word, enthusiasm, drive and a rise in stakes for our great footballers. The team prepared well and we are all witnesses to their success. Indeed the triumph of the black stars in that tournament will arguably be one of the single biggest sporting achievements the country has ever seen. \n\nFor a man whose dealings are always geared towards the achievement of set goals, Ghana\u2019s qualification was no mere luck but the end of a properly executed sporting policy of the Ministry under his supervision. \n\nOTHER ACHIEVEMENTS\/APPOINTMENTS\n\nThe exemplary leadership style of the Hon. Minister traces to the late 60\u2019s where his professional career took off with VALCO as a process and quality control engineer. A couple of years later he was appointed as the Director of the Capital Investment Board (CIB) now the Ghana investment Promotion Centre (GIPC) office in Frankfurt Germany between 1972 and 1976. \n\nThe success story did not end there; in 1976 he joined the Bank for Housing and Construction (BHC) as the Chief Operations Manager and between 1979 and 1989 got appointed as the Managing Director of the Bank during which period the bank moved from the bottom 11th position in the country to the 5th largest in terms of deposit base.\n\nHis proven performance in corporate restructuring and re-engineering led to his appointment as the new Managing Director of the National Investment Bank (NIB). During his tenure at the NIB, the Bank saw a tremendous growth in both its capital base and profit after a decade of systematic decline.\n\nThe honorable Yaw Osafo-Maafo served in two capacities working for Consultant Management Enterprise between 1992 and 1996. First he worked as a Senior Consult\/Trainer and then as the Director of Training. \n\nINTERNATIONAL EXPERTISE \n\nBetween 1992 and 1996, he performed various consultancy services for reputable international organizations including the World Bank, the African Development Bank (ADB) and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). \n\nHe was part of a team of international consultants who worked on the transformation of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to the African Union (AU). \n\nHe was appointed by the World Bank in 2006 to help in drawing up of the first budget of the newly elected government of Liberia\n\nHe also consulted for the World Bank in a number of African Countries and was a member of the first World Bank Financial sector mission to Uganda\n\n\nOTHER NOTABLE MANAGEMENT PROFILE \n\nPast President of the Executive Committee of the West African Bankers\u2019 Association \nChairman of the West African monetary zone convergence council \nAn Executive Member of the African Development Finance Institutions \nA former Member of the Board of Merchant Bank Ghana Ltd. \nHe is a founding Deputy Chairman of the Ghana Stock Exchange. \nHe has served as the Director of Asante Kotoko Football Club. \nHe was a also a chairman\/Member of Board of Directors of many companies including; \nNational Trust Holding Company \nNestle Ghana Limited \nRedco Limited \nPSCP (Gh) Limited \nPlant Pool Limited \nChairman of CME Board of Directors \nMethodist Conference \nGeneral purposes council of the Methodist Church \nDonewell Insurance Company \nDivestiture Implementation Committee \nNational Development Planning Commission \nPAPERS PRESENTED AT VARIOUS SEMINAR AND SYMPOSIA \n\nApril 2004 \u2013 Washington DC \nEmerging Trade and investment opportunities in Ghana at a round table discussion hosted by the Whittaker Group, Chargill and the US Ghana Economic Council\n\nMay 2004 \u2013 Kampala \nConference of African Ministers in Finance, Planning and Economic Development\n\nJune 2004 \u2013 Maputo \n4th summit of African Caribbean Pacific Heads of State and Government\n\nJune 2004 \nWorld Bank Conference \u2013 key note speech on restoring Global Balance together\n\nJuly 2004 \u2013 Paris \nStatement delivered on \u201creaching the completion point of the enhanced HIPC initiative\u201d to the Paris club\n\nOctober 2004 \u2013 Washington DC \nPlenary Session of World Bank and IMF Annual Meeting \n\nJuly 2003 \u2013 Tunis \nAfrican Development Bank \u2013 ECOWAS co-operation agreement\n\nAugust 2003 \u2013 Accra \nBudgetary cycle and budget process \u2013 Preparing and presenting the National Budget\n\nSeptember 2003 \u2013 Brunei \nCommonwealth Finance Ministers Meeting on investment promotion\n\nSeptember 2003 \u2013 Dubai \nWorld Bank Annual Board of Governors meeting\n\nSeptember 2003 \u2013 Dubai \nAnnual Meeting of World Bank and IMF\n\nJanuary 2002 \nRound Table Conference at Akosombo \u2013 Budget preparation in developing Countries (the case for Ghana)\n\nSeptember 2002 \u2013 London \nBusiness and sustainable development at the commonwealth Business centre (CBC) investment conference, London\n\nFebruary 1990 \u2013 Abidjan \nLack of Harmonization in Banking policies and practices among banks in the West African Sub-Region and its effects on WACH Operations at a seminar on West African Clearing Mechanics\n\nSeptember 1989 \u2013 Washington DC \nLiability Management of the Bank for Housing and Constriction of Ghana\n\n\n\nPROFESSIONAL BODIES \n\nMember of the Ghana Institute of engineers\n\n\nFellow of the Ghana Institute of Engineers\n\nHon. Fellow, Ghana institute of Architects \nPOLITICS AND THE NPP\n\nThe Honorable Yaw Osafo-Maafo\u2019s contribution and involvement in national politics dates as far back as his days in University; where he was a one time NUGS president. \n\nAs an advocate for good governance, he stood strong during the rallies aimed at expressing dissatisfaction at the management of the economy by the then government leading to his arrest a couple of time (even though never imprisoned)  \n\nThroughout this period and during the early stages in his career he nurtured his dedication to working in the public sector; a dream he has lived to accomplish till date; rising at every stage of his career. \n\nHis quest for a better Ghana saw him play a very active role in the formation of our great party thus the NPP. At a time when the now opposition NDC had ruled the country for so many years by an iron fist. At a time when opposition activities were unlawful if not criminal; a time when the militia of the then PNDC could brutalize any gathering deemed illegal by the ruling stratocracy \n\nAs determined as they were our founding fathers (including Nana Atakorah Gyimah, Victor Owusu jnr, Stephen Krakue) defied all attempts to quell their efforts. Some of these men including our own Yaw Osafo-Maafo sold their properties to sustain the movement. \n\nFor Honorable Yaw Osafo Maafo, the stakes were even higher considering the fact that he had been appointed by the same Junta to head the National Investment Bank (NIB). It was only a matter of time that he was going to pay back with his job including loss of his farm to \u201cbush fire\u201d. Despite all the mishaps, the honorable Member of Parliament was not perturbed. He, together with his cronies pushed forward for the democratization of the country; a benefit we all enjoy this very day\n\nThe unrelenting efforts of our founding fathers through to our first appearance in parliament (of which YOM was a part of) made a great impact on our democratic process. Their first appearance in parliament gave them the leverage to become the voice of the voiceless and the hope for all. The honorable Yaw Osafo Maafo, the then Shadow Minister for Trade and Industry was very instrumental as he has been till date\n\nDespite his heavy schedule the Hon. MP still remains one of the finest Members of Parliament since 1996. His strong bond and dedication to the cause of his people has earned him their trust to date. \n\nThe Honorable MP has a solid respect for the rule of law and a strong insight into constitutional issues. It was therefore not surprising that he was elected by the Ghana institute of Engineers to represent it at the consultative assembly which prepared the 1992 constitution of the republic of Ghana. At the consultative assembly, he was the chairman of the committee on the \u201cRights of the People\u201d. \n\nThe honorable Yaw Osafo-Maafo is a very active member of the National Executive Committee of the NPP and as indicated above a founding member of our great party. \nMoreover he has been a member of the National council since 1992. \n\nAs a finance person, he remain a member of the finance committee of the party and a member of the think tank group or the policy advisory group \u2013 responsible for preparing the manifesto of the NPP \n\nAdditionally, the Honorable Yaw Osafo Maafo was a Member of the team responsible for drafting the NPP constitution and also a Member of the team responsible for drafting the manifesto of the first flagbearer thus Prof. Adu Boahen (may his soul rest in perfect peace)\n\nFAMILY\n\nThe honorable Yaw Osafo-Maafo is married to Mrs. Anna Osafo-Maafo, a retired teacher (now a farmer) with whom he has four (4) lovely children\n\nCHURCH \n\nThe Honorable Yaw Osafo-Maafo is the Director of Fund Mobilization of the Methodist Church \u2013 Ghana.

The governing body of soccer in the country is the [[Canadian Soccer Association]] (CSA), which oversees the system and domestic cups (including the [[Canadian Championship]] or [[Voyageurs Cup]]) but does not operate any of its component leagues. For practical purposes top tier professional Canadian teams are often members of leagues that are based primarily in the United States.\n\n==Structure==\nThe professional league structure in Canada coincides with the league competitions of the neighbouring United States. [[Promotion and relegation]] does not occur between any league levels. Formally, Canada does not have a fully professional national league. The division one and two professional clubs in Canada compete in the [[Canadian Championship]] for the [[Voyageurs Cup]], which is the country's national championship trophy for professional teams and which earns the winner the right to play in the [[CONCACAF Champions League]].\n\nThe [[Canadian Soccer Association|CSA]] previously sanctioned the second version of the [[Canadian Soccer League]] (CSL) as Division 3; it is set up as a semi-professional league in Canada. The CSL has wanted to become the largest national domestic league.<ref>{{cite news\n| url= http:\/\/www.vancouversun.com\/sports\/looks+field+true+national+league\/3393800\/story.html\n| title= CSL looks to field a true national league\n| publisher= www.vancouversun.com\n| date=August 13, 2010\n| accessdate=November 2, 2010\n}}<\/ref> It has, however, always been a league based in southern Ontario, often with one team in Quebec and occasional teams in Ottawa. It was the highest level domestic league below the Canadian teams competing in American leagues from 2010-2013.

At times missed work payments and per diems for travel and other expenses in other parts of Canada were also very generous for the [[The Challenge Trophy|National Challenge Trophy]].\n\nCanadian based professional\/semi-professional leagues could not compete with [[North American Soccer League (1968\u20131984)|North American Soccer League]] teams when the [[United Soccer Association|USA]] and [[National Professional Soccer League (1967)|NPSL]] awarded franchises in Canada.  These leagues such as the NSL and PCSL were eclipsed by the marketing and stature of the U.S. based leagues and attendance issues either forced league mergers or re-formations and consolidation.\n\nAfter the collapse of the original North American Soccer League, and Canada's participation in the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] the original [[Canadian Soccer League (1987\u201392)|Canadian Soccer League]] started operations as a nationally based CSA sanctioned Division 1 league.<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/news.google.com\/newspapers?nid=ifIdVpG6JtcC&dat=19870226&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|title=Soccer rebirth|work=Vancouver Sun Newspaper|first=Archie|last=MacDonald|date=Feb 26, 1987|accessdate=January 18, 2015}}<\/ref>  When the original CSL folded in 1993, three Canadian teams moved to the [[American Professional Soccer League]] (APSL) where several had played preseason games and competed in post season tournaments.  When [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) won the USSF's competition for USA Division 1 status in 1993, the APSL lost stature and teams in several markets as well as in MLS markets in [[Denver]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[New York]] when MLS started three years later. Canadian teams continued to participate in the [[American Professional Soccer League|APSL]] and subsequently with the United Soccer Leagues merger in the [[A-League (1995\u20132004)|A League]] \/ [[USL First Division|USL-1]]. [[FIFA]] did not allow the USA Division 1 sanctioned league to include foreign teams which was why the APSL was never officially recognized as Division 1 before MLS.\n\nUS Soccer made sustainable gains after their [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] quarterfinal appearance.  By the mid 2000s, the US (and by extension Canadian) soccer landscape was changing with competitors to the [[United Soccer Leagues]] arising such as the [[U.S. Soccer Development Academy]] starting in 2007 or strengthening such as the resurgence of Major League Soccer.  Stronger USL-1 sides became frustrated by what they perceived as lack of ambition and a restrictive structure of the United Soccer Leagues.  With the introduction of designated players, Soccer United Marketing, expansion of MLS in 2005, and larger attendances in [[Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup]] games versus MLS sides, the stronger USL-1 sides became less competitive with MLS sides on and off the field. For example, MLS looked to move into USL-1 markets with the higher marketing power and based on US Open Cup results, better play.  With the decision to introduce a Canadian club to MLS, with [[Toronto FC]] joining in 2006 for the 2007 season, the [[Toronto Lynx]] self relegated from the USL-1 and began playing in the amateur-only [[USL Premier Development League]] (PDL).<ref>{{cite news| url = http:\/\/www.sportsnews24h.com\/Soccer\/Canada\/Toronto-Lynx\/11027.html| title = Toronto Lynx a costly labour of love| publisher = www.sportsnews24h.com| date = | accessdate = December 10, 2010}}<\/ref>  Frustration eventually resulted in the [[USSF Division 2 Professional League]] in 2010 and a new league, the [[North American Soccer League]].

The CNSL had four teams found the second league named the Canadian Professional Soccer League (1998-2006) or CPSL with four other new teams.  In 2006, the CPSL teams restarted in a new league, the second [[Canadian Soccer League]] (CSL).

There are two Division 3 Canadian-based semi-professional leagues, [[League1 Ontario]] (L1O) and the [[Premi\u00e8re Ligue de soccer du Qu\u00e9bec]] (PLSQ), centered in the provinces of [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]] respectively.\n\nAlso in Ontario; Toronto FC Academy and K-W United FC compete in the [[Great Lakes Division]] of the U23 [[Premier Development League]], a U.S. based league. In northwest Ontario, the Thunder Bay Chill competes alongside WSA Winnipeg of [[Manitoba]] in the [[Premier Development League|PDL]]'s [[Heartland Division]], while [[Calgary Foothills FC]] and [[Victoria Highlanders]] compete in the [[Premier Development League|PDL]]'s Northwest Division.  On November 18, 2015, four Ontario teams (including [[Forest City London]], who then moved to L1O) were given notice by the [[Ontario Soccer Association]] that they would no longer be permitted to participate in the PDL starting in 2017,<ref>{{cite web|title=0 - - - - - Ontario gives notice on PDL in province|url=http:\/\/www.canadiansoccernews.com\/index.php?\/page\/articles.html\/_\/24th-minute\/ontario-gives-notice-on-pdl-in-province-r5507|website=Canadian Soccer News|accessdate=20 November 2015}}<\/ref> potentially leaving only two Canadian teams in that league.\n\nThere are 12 provincial soccer associations in Canada with a number of leagues organized as amateur competitions at adult and\/or youth levels.

Both leagues are considered Division 4 in the [[United States soccer league system|American league system]], although currently only the PDL features Canadian clubs in competition. Both leagues are effectively a short 2.5 month season for post-secondary players following their collegiate commitments.\n\nThe [[Pacific Coast Soccer League]] (PCSL) similarly operates with both Canadian and American clubs, although on a much smaller scale, featuring only one American team and being primarily located in the [[Pacific Northwest]].\n\nAt Level 5 there are various amateur provincial leagues that are sanctioned under their individual provincial or territorial associations. This includes such leagues as the [[Vancouver Island Soccer League]], [[Vancouver Metro Soccer League]], [[Fraser Valley Soccer League]], [[Alberta Major Soccer League]], [[Saskatchewan Premier Soccer League]], [[Manitoba Major Soccer League]], [[Ontario League West]], [[Ontario League East]],<ref>http:\/\/www.ontariosoccer.net\/competitions\/leagues.aspx<\/ref> [[Ligue de Soccer Elite Quebec]], [[Nova Scotia Soccer League]], and [[New Brunswick Premier Senior Soccer League]]. This collection of leagues across the country collectively compete for the national [[The Challenge Trophy|Challenge Trophy]].\n\n===Future expansion===\nIn order to limit the Americanization of all of Canada's professional soccer clubs, the CSA issued a moratorium on the sanctioning of any new Division 2, 3, or 4 teams on November 15, 2010, with the ban set to last until September 30, 2011.<ref>{{cite news | url=http:\/\/www.canadiansoccernews.com\/content.php?528-CSA-puts-brakes-on-future-D2-sanctioning-in-US-leagues | title=CSA puts brakes on future D2 sanctioning in US leagues | date=November 15, 2010 | author=Duane Rollins | publisher=Canadian Soccer News | accessdate=July 7, 2011}}<\/ref> Despite the moratorium, the NASL announced that [[Ottawa]] had been awarded a franchise on June 20, 2011.<ref>{{cite news | url=http:\/\/www.nasl.com\/index.php?id=3&newsid=707 | title=Ottawa to Join NASL | date=June 20, 2011 | publisher=North American Soccer League | accessdate=July 7, 2011}}<\/ref>\n\nIn 2013, following the release of \"The Easton Report,\" the CSA set out to create a regionalized Division 3 semi-pro structure, similar to the major junior hockey leagues in Canada, with regional champions competing in a national tournament.<ref>http:\/\/the11.ca\/2013\/02\/05\/the-easton-report-what-it-means-for-div-3-in-canada\/<\/ref> In November 2013, the [[Ontario Soccer Association]] (OSA) announced plans to sanction [[League1 Ontario]] as part of this new structure.<ref>{{cite news | url=http:\/\/www.canadiansoccernews.com\/content.php?5069-OSA-will-sanction-semi-pro-League-One | title=OSA will sanction semi-pro League One | publisher=CanadianSoccerNews.com | date=November 16, 2013 | accessdate=December 8, 2013}}<\/ref>\n\n===Pyramid breakdown===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable hlist\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"4%\" |\n'''Tier'''\n| colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"96%\" |\n'''Leagues\/divisions'''\n\n|-\n|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#efefef;\"|\n1\n| colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n'''[[Major League Soccer]]''' (MLS)<br>\n'' - 20 teams, including 3 in Canada - ''<br>\n* [[Montreal Impact]]\n* [[Toronto FC]] \n*[[Vancouver Whitecaps FC]]\n|-\n\n|-\n|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#efefef;\"|\n2\n| colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n'''[[North American Soccer League]]''' (NASL)<br>\n'' - 13 teams, including 2 in Canada - '' <br>\n* [[FC Edmonton]]\n* [[Ottawa Fury FC]]\n\n|-\n|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#efefef;\"|\n3\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"32%\" |\n'''[[United Soccer League]]''' (USL) <br>\n'' - 28 teams, including 3 in Canada - ''\n\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"32%\" |\n'''[[League1 Ontario]]''' (L1O) <br>\n'' - 16 teams, all in Canada - ''\n\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"32%\" |\n'''[[Premi\u00e8re Ligue de soccer du Qu\u00e9bec]]''' (PLSQ)<br>\n'' - 7 teams, all in Canada - ''\n\n|-\n|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#efefef;\"|\n4\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n'''[[Premier Development League]]''' (PDL) <br>\n'' - 62 teams, including 5 in Canada - ''\n\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n'''[[Pacific Coast Soccer League]]''' (PCSL) <br>\n'' - 9 teams, all in Canada - ''\n\n|-\n! 5\n| colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n'''[[The Challenge Trophy]]''' <br>\n'' - 12 Provincial\/Territorial associations - '' <br> \n* [[Alberta Soccer Association]]\n* [[British Columbia Soccer Association]]\n* [[Manitoba Soccer Association]]\n* [[Newfoundland and Labrador Soccer Association]]\n* Northwest Territories Soccer Association\n* [[Ontario Soccer Association]]\n* Prince Edward Island Soccer Association\n* [[Quebec Soccer Federation]]\n* [[Saskatchewan Soccer Association]]\n* Soccer New Brunswick\n* [[Soccer Nova Scotia]]\n* Yukon Soccer Association\n|}\n\n==Women==\n\nThe women's game in Canada also has promotion and relegation only in amateur leagues that culminate in the Jubilee Shield.  It functions like a pyramid at the amateur levels.  Other U.S. based leagues with Canadian players and Canadian teams could be considered part of the women's league system.\n\nSixteen [[Canada women's national soccer team|Canadian Women's National Team (CWNT)]] players are paid by the CSA and other federal government athlete funding programs to play in the U.S. league, the [[National Women's Soccer League]], when they are not in national team camps. (Similarly, 24 [[United States women's national soccer team|USWNT]] members and 12 [[Mexico women's national football team|Mexico national team]] members are paid by their respective federations to play in the league.) Unsubsidized Canadian players can also play in the league as part of the international quota while others play in Europe.  Canadian players play in the NWSL although all franchises are located in the U.S.; there are no Canadian franchises in this U.S. league.  Financial remuneration varies in the NWSL; the four-month-long league is new as of 2013 and salaries for unsubsidized players are not high enough to support them without other outside income.<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/equalizersoccer.com\/2013\/04\/11\/nwsl-salaries-national-womens-soccer-league\/|title=A quick look at NWSL salaries|work=equalizer Soccer|first=Jeff|last=Kassouf|date=April 11, 2013|accessdate=March 31, 2014}}<\/ref>\n\nThe USL manages the [[W-League]]. The W-League is a U.S. based amateur league administered under the [[United States Adult Soccer Association|USASA]]. The W-League could be considered unofficially as Division 2 due to visibility and inter-provincial (and U.S. in the playoffs) travel requirements; refer to the [[United States soccer league system]].  The W-League has a 2.5 month long season with mainly post-secondary players playing in the [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport women's soccer|CIS women's soccer]] off season.  The W-League franchises compete in a parallel to Canada, Canada - U.S. competition; U.S. Division 2 competitors have entered the American [[USASA National Women's Open]] for which a Canadian team, being based in a separate country are not eligible.  The W-League teams have not competed in competitions outside of their league and league playoffs.  In the past when there have not been professional U.S. leagues ([[Women's United Soccer Association|WUSA]], [[Women's Professional Soccer|WPS]]), the CWNT pool players not playing in European leagues played in the W-League for Canadian-based teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.canadasoccer.com\/canada-s-world-cup-team-opens-camp-in-vancouver-p147068&t=article_canadasoccer100|title=Canada's World Cup team opens camp in Vancouver (Note teams)|work=Canada Soccer|first=no|last=author|accessdate=March 31, 2014}}<\/ref>\n\nOther than CWNT pool players and CIS players (in their two-month CIS season or in their 2.5 month off season), there are provincial competitions run by each of the provincial soccer associations to qualify an amateur team for the national championship, the Jubilee Shield.  Some of these are leagues and others cup competitions.  The PCSL is similar to the W-League (season length, orientation to post-secondary players), but they have an entry into the B.C. championship competition.  Many other primarily adult amateur leagues, some with eight month seasons, also culminate in the Jubilee Shield.  There are indoor (March) and outdoor (September) national championships given Canada's climate.\n\n===Pyramid breakdown===\n{| class=\"wikitable hlist\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! width=\"4%\" | Level\n! width=\"96%\" | Leagues or Divisions\n|-\n! 1\n|\n'''[[National Women's Soccer League]]''' (NWSL)<br>\n'' - 10 teams, including 0 in Canada - ''\n|-\n! 2\n|\n''(No league exists)''\n|-\n! 3\n|\n'''[[League1 Ontario#Women's Division|League1 Ontario]]''' (L1O)<br>\n'' - 11 teams, all in Canada - ''\n|-\n! 4\n|\n'''[[Pacific Coast Soccer League]]''' (PCSL)<br>\n'' - Premier Women's Division scheduled to restart in 2016 - ''\n|-\n! 5\n|\n'''[[The Jubilee Shield|The Jubilee Trophy]]'''<br>\n* [[British Columbia Provincial Soccer Championship]]\n* [[Alberta Major Soccer League]]\n* [[Ligue de Soccer Elite Quebec|Ligue de Soccer \u00c9lite Quebec]]\n* Other Provincial Competitions\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[English football league system]]\n* [[List of soccer clubs in Canada]]\n* [[United States soccer pyramid]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Canada Soccer}}\n{{League systems}}\n\n[[Category:Soccer leagues in Canada| ]]\n[[Category:Football league systems in North America]]","timestamp":"20160410102946","user-timestamp":"20150410102946"},{"title":"Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Kerang Football Club","content":"<div class=\"boilerplate metadata afd vfd xfd-closed\" style=\"background-color: #F3F9FF; margin: 2em 0 0 0; padding: 0 10px 0 10px; border: 1px solid #AAAAAA;\">\n:''The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style=\"color:red\">'''Please do not modify it.'''<\/span>  Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a [[Wikipedia:Deletion review|deletion review]]).
