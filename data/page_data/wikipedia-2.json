They were the first samurai group of the Tokugawa era to allow those from non-samurai classes (farmers and merchants, for example) to join. Many joined the group due to the desire to become a samurai and be involved in political affairs. However, it is a misconception that most of the Shinsengumi members were from non-samurai classes. Out of 106 Shinsengumi members (among a total of 302 members at the time), there were 87 samurai, eight farmers, three merchants, three medical doctors, three priests, and two craftsmen. Several of the leaders, such as Yamanami, Okita, Sait\u014d, Nagakura, and Harada, were born samurai.\n\n== Shinsengumi regulations ==\nThe code of the Shinsengumi included five articles, prohibiting deviation from the samurai code ([[Bushido]]), leaving the Shinsengumi, raising money privately, taking part in others' litigation, and engaging in private fights. The penalty for breaking any rule was [[seppuku]]. In addition, if the leader of a unit was mortally wounded in a fight, all the members of the unit must fight and die on the spot and, even in a fight where the death toll was high, the unit was not allowed to retrieve the bodies of the dead, except the corpse of the leader of the unit.\n\n== Uniform ==\nThe members of the Shinsengumi were highly visible in battle due to their distinctive uniforms. Following the orders of the Shinsengumi commander [[Serizawa Kamo]], the standard uniform consisted of the [[haori]] and [[hakama]] over a [[kimono]], with a white cord called a ''tasuki'' crossed over the chest and tied in the back. The function of the ''tasuki'' was to prevent the sleeves of the kimono from interfering with movement of the arms. The Shinsengumi wore a light [[chainmail]] suit beneath their robes and a light [[helmet]] made of iron<ref name=\"Turnbull (2011)\"\/> and a head band on which was inscribed the word, ''makoto'' (''sincerity'').<ref name=\"Turnbull (2011)\">Turnbull S.

We are in a bit of a conflict regarding the abbreviation of Djurg\u00e5rdens IF. Many fans of the club seem to dislike the abbrevation Dif. However, this is how it's pronounced and how the abbreviation is spelled in neutral mainstream media. Therefore I don't see why this spelling should be removed. Before you edited the section, both the linguistically correct abbreviation (Dif) and the stylized one (DIF) were included. Why couldn't you accept this? [[User:Aikclaes|Aikclaes]] ([[User talk:Aikclaes|talk]]) 09:49, 17 April 2014 (UTC)\n\n:The linguistically correct abbreviation is DIF, even though it is spelled out as if it was a word, because it is an abbreviation, not a word in itself. You can compare it with [[IKEA]] and [[SAS Group|SAS]] for instance. <span style=\"font-family:serif\">[[User:Bandy boy|Bandy boy]] ([[User talk:Bandy boy|talk]])<\/span> 10:08, 17 April 2014 (UTC)\n\n:: I'm afraid the linguistic experts at Spr\u00e5kr\u00e5det don't agree with you. They are in fact very clear on the subject: Acronyms that are read as a word, like Ikea and Dif, should be written in small caps. They even use Ikea as an example. Source: http:\/\/www.sprakradet.se\/2113#item101000 Why can't both ways of spellings be included, as in the original wording?

In that case, the article itself would have the spelling Djurgardens IF, since most non-Swedish journalists replace the letter \u00c5 with an A. No, the issue here is how the club's name is correctly abbreviated in Swedish. My argument is supported by the [[Swedish Language Council]], the primary regulatory body for the Swedish language. Your argument is only supported by your own personal taste. I'm asking you for a third time now, and really hope for an answer: Why can't both ways of spelling be included, as in the original wording?

Djurg\u00e5rdens IF is written Djurg\u00e5rdens IF in English, since it is a name of a club, names do not get \"translated\" to words without diacritic markings. DIF is written DIF since it is an abbreviation and this actually follows Wikipedia's spelling guidelines.

The only thing close to an argument for your case that you have presented so far is that the Wiki pages for Ikea and SAS use capital letters. But our issue has nothing to do with how the page Djurg\u00e5rdens IF Fotboll is to be named. We are concerned with how the club's name is abbreviated in Swedish. Your only reason for removing the abbreviation ''Dif'' is because you don't like it. You have presented no source that supports your claim that ''Dif'' is linquistically incorrect, therefore I cannot accept your last edit.

If you want to change the Wikipedia guidelines, take that discussion up at the appropriate talk page instead of using this page as a battleground. This concerns how the name of the organisation is abbreviated, and like the name it is decided by the organisation itself. That is a linguistic rule which is above what you are relating to. DIF is not a general word but a name.

This has nothing to do with Wikipedia guidelines for abbreviations. Your claim, that an organization itself decides how it's abbreviation should be written outside of the organization, is simply incorrect. You have presented no source that supports this claim, because it's not correct.  The governing language bodies for the Swedish language are clear. Whether or not the word is a \"name\" or a \"general word\" (whatever you mean by this) is completely irrelevant.

Djurg\u00e5rdens IF is correctly abbreviated DIF, because that is what Djurg\u00e5rdens IF has decided. That's the foremost language rule in this case. Abbreviations are not spelled like words even if they are pronounced as if they were words. A proper name of an organisation is a proper name decided by that organisation. The same goes for the abbreviation of that proper name. Just like you spell your name Claes and not Klas. No general lingustic rules can change that. <span style=\"font-family:serif\">[[User:Bandy boy|Bandy boy]] ([[User talk:Bandy boy|talk]])<\/span> 13:11, 18 April 2014 (UTC)\n\n::::::::::::::::The Swedish Language Council is the primary regulatory body for the Swedish language, so whether or not you personally think they are incorrect regarding this issue is completely irrelevant. Do you have a source for your claim that an organization itself should have any power over how it's name is stylized outside the organization, for instance in encyclopedias? [[User:Aikclaes|Aikclaes]] ([[User talk:Aikclaes|talk]]) 13:25, 18 April 2014 (UTC)\n\n:::::::::::::::::This is not a matter of how the abbreviation is stylized (that is a question about fonts etc.) but about spelling. Common sense says you spell a name the way the organisation spells it, but I'll see if I can look up a source for you if you don't believe this. <span style=\"font-family:serif\">[[User:Bandy boy|Bandy boy]] ([[User talk:Bandy boy|talk]])<\/span> 14:22, 18 April 2014 (UTC)\n\n::::::::::::::::::This does indeed have to do with how the word is ''stylized''. See this page for a related example https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kiss_(band) The music group Kiss ''stylizes'' their band name KISS even though it's not pronounced letter by letter.  14:56, 18 April 2014 (UTC)\n\n:::::::::::::::::::That's about a name which is a word. If KISS was an abbreviation, it would be perfectly in line with normal spelling procedures to spell it KISS. It has nothing to do with the way it is pronounced. <span style=\"font-family:serif\">[[User:Bandy boy|Bandy boy]] ([[User talk:Bandy boy|talk]])<\/span> 20:39, 18 April 2014 (UTC)\n\n:::::::::::::::::Here is one source: [http:\/\/tidningsliv.wordpress.com\/tag\/sprakregler\/] \"Om man g\u00f6r en intervju med en person s\u00e5 kollar man alltid stavningen av personens namn, eller hur?

He seems to oppose the language rules of TT (arguably Sweden's largest language authority alongside the Language Council, and incidently the same two sources you keep removing from the article). I can't see why this guy's personal opinions are of any value. [[User:Aikclaes|Aikclaes]] ([[User talk:Aikclaes|talk]]) 15:02, 18 April 2014 (UTC)\n\n:::::::::::::::::::He has good reasons.

Its seat is located in the town [[H\u00f6gsby]].\n\nThe latest nationwide subdivision reform in Sweden was centred on the year 1971. In this area the amalgamation took place already in 1969 when Fagerhult joined H\u00f6gsby.\n\nThe municipality has the smallest population of the municipalities of Kalmar County. The population increase has been insignificant - in 1908 the parish had some 5,000 inhabitants. The municipality itself was created with the Swedish [[municipalities of Sweden|municipal reform]] in 1971.\n\n==History==\nH\u00f6gsby Municipality has a history tracing back to the [[medieval]] age, around 1,200 BC. In the 15th and 16th century it was involved in conquests by the [[Denmark|Danish]] soldiers, and Swedish king [[Gustav Vasa]] in his quest to find revolutionary [[Nils Dacke]] hideout and supporters in the [[Sm\u00e5land]] forests demolished H\u00f6gsby.\n\nIn the municipality are also several old churches of interests with some old archifacts.\n\n==Geography==\nIn total, most of the municipality consists of forest and water areas; some of it has been made nature reserves hosting rare animals and plants.\n\nOther sights are the streams and lakes that offer opportunities for fishing, bathing and canoeing, or just as nature experiences. It reflects itself in the coat of arms, showing water. The most notable streams are [[Em\u00e5n]] and [[Alster\u00e5n]]; with [[Allgunnen]] being the largest lake.\n\n==Localities==\nThere are 5 [[Urban areas in Sweden|urban area]]s (also called a T\u00e4tort or locality) in H\u00f6gsby Municipality.\n\nIn the table the localities are listed according to the size of the population as of December 31, 2005.

All of the other guys sang their crowd pleasers. After the 2006 show I met a gal I had dated in 1976 and ended up married and living back in Jersey in Shark River Hills in Neptune Township. I have been writing blues and country music and have a band of retirees. I go by Asbury Slim these days. I released an indie blues CD in 2010 that is still selling well via the Internet especially in the European market. I have a country music trilogy that I plan to officially release soon although the songs are on many of the internet music websites already. You can hear many of my songs at: www.broadjam.com\/asbury-slim also www.reverbnation.com\/sharkriverproductions Some of the songs are rough demos and some are studio quality. Play Something Country. ...That's All and Hitchiking Down The Parkway are both currently on the Broadjam.com Top Ten Country Boogie List. Hitchiking Down The Parkway is a true Jersey Shore song about Asbury Park during the Springsteen era.\n\nHEY THANKS AGAIN FOR YOUR INPUT\n\nDenis J Quilligan Jr","timestamp":"20160410100440","user-timestamp":"20150410100440"},{"title":"Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Saltwater Croc vs. Great White Shark","content":"<div class=\"boilerplate metadata vfd\" style=\"background-color: #F3F9FF; margin: 2em 0 0 0; padding: 0 10px 0 10px; border: 1px solid #AAAAAA;\">\n:''The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style=\"color:red\">'''Please do not modify it.'''<\/span>  Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a [[Wikipedia:Deletion review|deletion review]]).

Indigenous animal species include a variety of [[mammal]]s (including endangered [[tiger]]s and the vulnerable [[Asiatic black bear]]), [[crab]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[amphibian]]s, [[fish]], [[insect]]s, and over 190 species of [[bird]]s.\n\nIndigenous plant life include numerous species of [[flowering plants]] including the endangered [[Shorea roxburghii|phayom]], ''[[Hopea ferrea]]'' and ''[[Dalbergia oliveri]]'', the vulnerable ''[[Hopea odorata]]'' and [[Sumatran pine]], and a variety of [[conifers]] and [[Lycopodiopsida|clubmosses]]. Near threatened birds include the [[Siamese fireback]] and [[Oriental darter]]. The Siamese fireback has been nominated to be the national bird of Thailand.\n\nWildlife conservation is just beginning to be realized in the province. Plans for [[sustainable development]] are being implemented, and over the last 30 years, more and more land has been set aside as protected areas. The protected areas in Phitsanulok include the province's [[Phitsanulok Province#National parks|four national parks]].\n\n==Animals==\n\n===Mammals===\nPhitsanulok Province is the native habitat of a great number of [[mammals]], including canines, felines, weasles, bears, civets, rodents, ungulates, elephants, monkeys, rabbits and hare. Included in the list of species is the endangered [[tiger]] and the vulnurable [[Asiatic black bear]]. A representative sampling of the province's mammals is as follows:\n\n====Canines====\n'''Order''': [[Carnivora]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Canidae]]\n\nWild canines of Phitsanulok Province include species of [[fox]].<ref name=\"National Parks in Northern Thailand\">{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.trekthailand.net\/north41\/index.html |title=National Parks in Northern Thailand-Phu Hin Rong Kla National Park |publisher=Trekthailand.net |date= |accessdate=2012-04-18}}<\/ref>\n\n====Felines====\n[[File:Tigerramki.jpg|thumb|right|Tiger]]\n[[File:Leopard africa.jpg|thumb|left|Leopard]]\n[[File:Bengalkatze.jpg|thumb|right|Leopard cat]]\n'''Order''': [[Carnivora]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Felidae]]\n\nThere are 41 known species of felines in the world today which have all descended from a common ancestor about 10.8 million years ago. This taxa originated in Asia and spread across [[continent]]s by crossing [[land bridge]]s. The following feline species are reported by the Department of National Parks to be living in the wild in Phitsanulok Province:\n*[[Tiger]]<ref name=\"National Parks in Northern Thailand\"\/> (''Panthera tigris'')\n*[[Leopard]]<ref name=\"National Parks in Northern Thailand\"\/> (''Panthera pardus'')\n*[[Leopard cat]]<ref name=\"National Parks in Northern Thailand\"\/> (''Prionailurus bengalensis'')\nOf these three cats, the tiger is the only [[endangered species]]. The primary reason for the steady population decline of the tiger is human activity. Tigers are threatened by illegal trade of their skins and the destruction of forests. For years, it has been claimed that there are about 500 wild tigers in Thailand. Recent studies, however, indicate that the number is closer to 150. To make things worse, in [[Burma]], hunting tigers in the wild is still legal.\n\n====Weasles====\n[[File:Martes flavigula Dresden.jpg|thumb|left|Yellow-throated marten]]\n'''Order''': [[Carnivora]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Mustelidae]]\n\nWeasles are typically small animals with short legs, short round ears, and thick fur. Some mustelids have exquisite furs which have been valuable for many centuries\u2014the mink, the sable (a type of marten) and the ermine (stoat) are all members of the family.

Common characteristics of modern bears include a large body with stocky legs, a long snout, shaggy hair, paws with five nonretractile claws, and a short tail. The Department of National Parks reports that there are [[Asiatic black bear]]s<ref name=\"National Parks in Northern Thailand\"\/> (''Ursus thibetanus'') living in the wild in Phitsanulok Province.

There are 4 species worldwide and 1 species which occurs in Thailand, the [[Oriental darter]] (''Anhinga melanogaster''). This [[near threatened]] species was sighted in Phitsanulok in 2006 and 2007.<ref name=\"2007 Thailand Bird Reports\"\/><ref name=\"2006 Thailand Bird Reports\"\/>\n\n====Barbets====\n'''Order''': [[Piciformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Megalaimidae]]\n\nThe barbets are plump birds, with short necks and large heads. They get their name from the bristles which fringe their heavy bills. Most species are brightly coloured. There are 84 species worldwide and 15 species which occur in Thailand.

The first part of the poem deals with the basic principles of the 'Way of Order'({{indic|lang=ta|indic=\u0bae\u0bc1\u0bb1\u0bc8 \u0bb5\u0bb4\u0bbf|trans=mu\u1e5fai vazhi}}) which is his term for [[natural law]].\n\n*Every human of every town is of the same value because they are \u0b95\u0bc7\u0bb3\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bcd (related). Hence, all people should be bound by one, same moral and legal code.\n*\u0ba8\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0bb1\u0bc1 ([[good and evil|good]]) and \u0ba4\u0bc0\u0ba4\u0bc1 ([[evil]]) do not come from others. Hence, humans are liable for both the pleasure and suffering they feel.\n*Death is a natural part of the cycle of life, it is not new. Hence, this life must be made use of to its full potential.\n*Yet, life should neither be full of pleasure (\u0bae\u0b95\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd\u0b9a\u0bcd\u0b9a\u0bbf), nor full of storms (\u0baa\u0bc1\u0baf\u0bb2\u0bcd) [of suffering]. Hence, life should be full of [[plenitude]].\n\n===Allegory of the raft===\nHe further goes onto explain these principles with an example of a raft.\n\n*He compares birth to lightning, suggesting it can happen spontaneously anywhere.\n*He gives an example of a raft which is allegorical to human life going downstream a steep hill, having a perilous journey through boulders and faces its climax just as in \u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb1\u0bb5\u0bcb\u0bb0\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bbe\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9a\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd (lit. Wisemen's vision means fate) which is death.\n*He concludes that since everyone's life is like the raft's journey, it is irrational to magnify the \u0baa\u0bc6\u0bb0\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bcb[\u0bb0\u0bcd] (accomplished people) and even worse to diminish \u0b9a\u0bbf\u0bb1\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bcb[\u0bb0\u0bcd](less accomplished people), because everyone goes through similar tribulations whatever their social estate might be.\n\n==Influence==\nHe was extremely influential in the revivalist [[Self-respect movement]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bharathi|first=S.

The story is set during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nThe plot begins with the marriage of Dr Maturin and Diana Villiers. Soon after, Captain Aubrey takes HMS ''Worcester'' on blockade duty around Toulon, France, until the ship is sent for refitting. With these refitting, he is reassigned to HMS ''Surprise'' on which he, Maturin and Professor Graham seek a new ally among the pashas on the coast of the [[Ionian Sea]].\n\n==Plot summary==\n\nMaturin and Villiers are happily married. After a time together in their new house on Half Moon Street, Maturin settles in his rooms at The Grapes, where Diana comes often, and from which he walks to breakfast with her daily. He has missions to do, and Aubrey needs to get away from his financial problems. Aubrey gets a stint on HMS ''Worcester'' for Toulon blockade duty. Jagiello brings the Maturins to port in his own carriage, which upsets, making Stephen\u2019s arrival rather last-minute.\n\nWhile she is doing gunnery practice with gunpowder bought from a fireworks firm, ''Worcester'' encounters the French ship ''Jemmapes''. Worcester engages immediately, not having changed to ordinary gunpowder. ''Jemmapes'' sees the bright colors as the sign of some new weapon, and sails away. Some of the crew practice an oratorio while the midshipmen practice ''[[Hamlet]]''. Passengers are dropped off at Gibraltar and Port Mahon (Graham, professor of moral philosophy), though the parson Nathaniel Martin is aboard long enough for Maturin to discover their shared interest in birds, before Martin joins  HMS ''Berwick''. ''Worcester'' joins the squadron off Toulon. Babbington, master and commander, joins the squadron in the Mediterranean as captain of the ''Dryad''. Babbington fell in love with Admiral Harte\u2019s daughter Fanny. But her father wants the best husband for his daughter that money can buy, and that is Andrew Wray. Babbington figures that Wray and Harte combined got him assigned to blockade duty. Before ''Dryad'', the Worcesters see HMS ''Surprise'' arrive with mail for this fleet, joining it.\n\nAdmiral Thornton\u2019s desire is to engage the French in a fleet action. The second-in-command, Harte, has lesser goals. Harte sends Aubrey and Babbington on a mission to the north coast of Africa, with the notion that Babbington will be taken by the French ships in the neutral port Medina. Babbington sees the ships before he enters port and rejoins ''Worcester''. Being told not to fire first at the French, Aubrey enters the neutral port in hopes the French ships will fire first, but they never do, so he returns, in the right but with Aubrey feeling his image is tarnished. ''Worcester'' brings Maturin to the coast of France, and waits to pick him up. Maturin's mission fails due to other British spies afoot. Waiting for the launch, Maturin finds the other British agent, Professor Graham, who has shot himself in the foot. Maturin hands him over to the Captain of the Fleet to act as a Turkish advisor. Later, the French fleet slips the blockade. Thornton is pleased, but the winds change, barring a successful engagement. The French do not want battle and return to port. A few shots were exchanged, killing the captain and first lieutenant of HMS ''Surprise''. Further, ''Worcester'', a poorly built ship, is strained beyond usefulness. Thornton tells Aubrey to take her to Malta to refit, then shift part of his crew to the ''Surprise'' for a mission to the [[Ionian Islands#Napoleonic era|Seven Islands]] on the Ionian coast. As they sail, a poetry contest is set up, with Mowett and Rowan splitting the prize. Then ''Surprise'' takes the blockade runner ''Bonhomme Richard'', filled with spices, dyes, and heaps of silver. The silver is shared out at once, and Rowan takes the prize to Malta. Aubrey visits the three beys, Ismail, Mustapha and Sciahon, choosing the last as the best ally for Britain to take [[Corfu]], if not more of the Seven Islands, from the French. Sciahon Bey holds Kutali, the preferred base for naval operations.\n\n''Surprise'' is long in port at Kutali being windbound. The ''Dryad'' and the gun-laden transports she fetched seem long in coming. Graham engages in a harsh argument with Aubrey. Rumor spreads that Ismail has permission to take charge of Kutali, causing the locals to beg Aubrey to protect them. Graham travels by land to [[Ali Pasha]] of Iannina learning that Mustapha lured ''Dryad'' and the transports into his port, and is sailing on his ship ''Torgud'' to take Kutali. The rumor was started by Ali Pasha in his own double dealing, to fire up Mustapha against his enemy Ismail; in the end, Ali Pasha wants rid of Mustapha. Mustapha is on his own, with no approval from the [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan of Turkey]]. ''Surprise'' is ready to sail on the instant, especially as the winds have changed. Aubrey will attack both ships, ''Kitabi'' sailing with ''Torgud''. They meet at sea, with ''Surprise'' firing broadsides instantly and repeatedly. ''Torgud'' is cruelly damaged, with many dead. Young Williamson loses half his arm. ''Kitabi'' goes between ''Surprise'' and ''Torgud'', crashing into ''Torgud''\u2019s side. Aubrey boards ''Kitabi'', and takes her. Boarding crew proceeds to ''Torgud'', jumping across like Nelson. Pullings falls, so Aubrey stands above him then fights fiercely in the close hand-to-hand combat. Aubrey reaches Mustapha, early wounded and sitting. His aide Ulusan says, we surrender. Bonden carries the swords and ensigns. Aubrey asks Mowett what happened to Pullings, to learn he survives. They return to the ''Surprise'' before the ''Torgud'' can sink.\n\n==Characters ==\n\n''See also [[Recurring characters in the Aubrey\u2013Maturin series]]''\n\n*[[Jack Aubrey]]: Captain of {{HMS|Worcester|1769|6}} on blockade duty at Toulon.

After a long and bloody action the Turkish frigate surrendered when her obstinate captain was overpowered by his remaining officers. The damaged ''Alis Fezzan'' escaped during the night. Of particular relevance to the plot of the Ionian Mission is that the Turkish frigate was armed with brass 24-pounder long guns and two immense 42-pounders (the nearest British gun equivalent for the French 36-pounder - French pounds were heavier than British pounds).<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=16194 |date=22 October 1808 |startpage=1437 |endpage=1438 }}<\/ref><ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Gardiner |editor-first=Robert |year=1998 |title=The Victory of Sea Power |location=London |publisher=Chatham Publishing |pages=148\u2013149}}<\/ref>\n\nIn the engagement with the two Turkish ships, Aubrey first boarded the ''Kitabi'', which surrendered, then jumped across to the nearby ''Torgud''. One of his men said he had boarded like Nelson, referring to Horatio Nelson at [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson#Battle of Cape St Vincent|the battle of St. Vincent]], who took two Spanish ships, jumping from the ''San Nicolas'' to the ''San Josef''. Jack Aubrey's model in his naval career has always been Lord Nelson.\n\n==Series chronology==\n\nThis novel references actual events with accurate historical detail, like all in this series. In respect to the [[Aubrey\u2013Maturin series#Internal Chronology|internal chronology]] of the series, it is the second of eleven novels (beginning with ''The Surgeon's Mate)'' that might take five or six years to happen but are all pegged to an extended 1812, or as Patrick O'Brian says it, 1812a and 1812b (introduction to ''The Far Side of the World'', the tenth novel in this series). The events of ''The Yellow Admiral'' again match up with the historical years of the Napoleonic wars in sequence, as the first six novels did.\n\n==Reviews==\n\n[[Kirkus Reviews]] finds this novel to have splendid adventures and the writing at a stately pace.\n\n<blockquote>Aubrey and Maturin (''The Thirteen Gun Salute'', p. 496; ''The Surgeon's Mate''--see below) sail again. This time it's to The Meal to blockade the French fleet in Toulon. Fickle westerlies, however, blow them to the Aegean, and political currents put them in the middle of Ottoman affairs. Sinking into debt (thanks to his idiotic investments) and out of favor with their Lords of the Admiralty (thanks to his politically rash father), Captain Jack Aubrey misses the chance for a top-rate new ship and has to settle for H.M.S. ''Worcester'', an ancient, leaky man-of-war. Undignified as the assignment may be, Aubrey is quite pleased to be able to sail away from Britain. He can't get things right on shore, but he is quick enough to put ''Worcester'' to trim, taking slack out of the sails and the crew until ''Worcester'' is the ablest ship in the line bottling up Napoleon's navy in Toulon. Meanwhile, of course, Aubrey's old friend Stephen Maturin, at last married to the woman he has followed to numerous hemispheres, is with him. The French toy with the English, trying to sneak through the blockade, but there are no conclusive actions. Maturin is eventually assigned a little espionage duty, and there is a hair-raising infiltration of the enemy coast. When ''Worcester'' at last gives up the ghost after one too many skirmishes, Aubrey transfers his pennant to the smaller, swifter ''Surprise'' and follows orders to sail to the Greek islands to tinker with the balance of power at the fringes of the Turkish empire. Splendid adventures at a stately pace.<ref>{{cite web |url=https:\/\/www.kirkusreviews.com\/book-reviews\/patrick-obrian\/the-ionian-mission\/ |title=The Ionian Mission |date=20 May 2010 |edition=15 November 1991 |accessdate=24 August 2014 |publisher=Kirkus Reviews}}<\/ref><\/blockquote>\n\n[[Publishers Weekly]] finds Aubrey caught in a net of Turkish politics and rivalries:\n\n<blockquote>This entry in the Aubrey\/Maturin series (see above review of ''The Surgeon's Mate'') finds Captain Jack Aubrey \"shoved into a temporary command in that rotten old ''Worcester''\", a poorly built ship. Worse, he's off to the Mediterranean to join the Royal Navy's endless blockade of the French port of Toulon. Aside from a chance encounter with a French man-of-war that triggers a brief but extremely colorful battle, there is little excitement as HMS ''Worcester'' settles in with the other blockading ships, some with crews showing signs of strain from remaining constantly alert but inactive. Second in command at Toulon is Admiral Harte, no friend of Aubrey's (who cuckolded the admiral years ago). Harte dispatches Aubrey on a delicate mission to the politically volatile Ionian coast. Although he has the succor of Stephen Maturin, a seasoned intelligence agent, and Professor Graham, an expert on the region's customs, Aubrey is caught in a complex net of Turkish politics and rivalries. And while Harte seems to offer all reasonable backing for the mission, Aubrey knows that should he fail, the admiral would like nothing better than to throw him to the dogs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http:\/\/www.barnesandnoble.com\/w\/ionian-mission-patrick-obrian\/1100871644?ean=9780393308211 |title=The Ionian Mission Editorial Reviews |publisher=Barnes and Noble |accessdate=24 August 2014}}<\/ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http:\/\/www.publishersweekly.com\/978-0-393-30821-1 |title=The Ionian Mission |publisher=Publishers Weekly |date=20 January 1992 |accessdate=24 August 2014}}<\/ref><\/blockquote>\n\n==Publication history==\n*1981 William Collins hardback first edition ISBN  0-00-222365-1\n*1982 Fontana paperback edition\n*1992, January W.

Norton issued ''The Ionian Mission'' eleven years after its initial publication, as a paperback in 1992. Ironically, it was a US publisher, [[J. B.

[[HarperCollins|Collins]] picked it up in the UK, and continued to publish each novel as O'Brian completed another story.

In regard to filmographies in general, the film actors project supports complete filmographies and I do support that, however I don't support creating a new article simply so there is one for little known, non-notable or essentially lost films in order to create a blue link in the filmography. I don't endorse using [[WP:NOTLINK]] as an argument against a listing of film appearances for a given artist. What Wikipedia is not is an arbitrary list of external links or internal articles that have little context or relativeness to the subject of the article. [[WP:NOTDIR]] says clearly \"there is nothing wrong with having lists if their entries are famous because they are associated with or significantly contributed to the list topic.\" That to me is part and parcel of what a filmography is. [[WP:FILMBIO]] specifically endorses a filmography. What I don't endorse are the ever-growing number of navigational filmography templates that are places at the bottom of filmbio articles and are beginning to overwhelm the article. Such aren't endorsed by the filmbio group for actors unless that particular actor has filled a variety of roles, such as film work, author of printed materials, music, or covers a specialized partnership - what I mean is a widely diverse body of work. Good examples might be [[Template:Harry Connick, Jr.]] or [[Template:FredandGinger]]. If we are talking such a template\/box, then I'm not supportive of it, and see no need to have a separate template that distinguishes between \"filmography\" proper and \"selected filmography\". The name of and what is included within such tools is up to its creator to determine, based on the already existing boxes. \n\nI'm a bit confused on this. What template is being discussed? If it is like the examples given, I use them regularly and find them helpful: \n*<nowiki>{{imdb name|id=0001853|name=Vanessa L. Williams}}<\/nowiki>\n*<nowiki>{{ibdb name|id=82232|name=Vanessa L.

Originally founded in [[Zikhron Ya'akov]] in 1949, it relocated to [[Kfar Hasidim]], adjacent to [[Rekhasim]], in 1955, where it operates today with nearly 200 students and a [[kolel]].\n\n==Early history==\nKnesses Chizkiyahu was founded by Rabbi [[Noah Shimonowitz]], one of the greatest students of Rabbi [[Boruch Ber Leibowitz]],<ref>{{citation |last=Meller |first=Rabbi Shimon Yosef |title=The Brisker Rav, Volume One: The Life and Times of Maran HaGaon HaRav Yitzchok Ze'ev HaLevi Soloveichik, ztl |url=http:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=OXDPoTN1OH4C&pg=PA451|page=451 (ftn 45) |accessdate=1 November 2009}}<\/ref> who decided to open a yeshiva after surviving the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. He visited the [[Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz|Chazon Ish]] for his blessing and advice, and was told to seek a suitable location in the north of Israel, which at the time did not host any Torah institutions. Together with his brother-in-law, Rabbi Dovid Mishkovsky, Rabbi Shimonowitz established the yeshiva in the central synagogue of Zikhron Ya'akov and named it after Mishkovsky's father, Rabbi Chizkiyahu Yosef Mishkovsky, former Rav of Krinik, Poland. The initial enrollment of three students expanded to thirty students by the end of the first year.<ref name=\"Meringer\">{{cite web |url=http:\/\/www.tog.co.il\/he\/Services\/Service.asmx\/AddNewMailFromSiteToMailList\/Article.aspx?id=120 |last=Meringer |first=Motty |title=Yeshivas Knesses Chizkiyahu |date=29 April 2009 |accessdate=1 November 2009 |publisher=Etrog News}}<\/ref> \n\nIn 1952, Rabbi [[Elyah Lopian]], the contemporary leader of the [[Mussar movement]], joined the staff as [[Mashgiach Ruchani]], together with his son-in-law, Rabbi Kalman Pinsky. Lopian's influence on the yeshiva was so pronounced that it continues to this day. As an example of one tradition which he instituted, any yeshiva student who fills a cup to wash his hands must refill it for the next user in line.<ref name=\"Meringer\" \/>\n\n==Move to Kfar Hasidim==\nThe yeshiva experienced much difficulty in its early years, as students lacked sleeping facilities and organized meals due to the country's difficult economic situation. The location of the yeshiva in the central synagogue also caused friction between the students and local residents coming to pray. The yeshiva administration decided to find a new building, and then to leave Zikhron Ya'akov altogether.\n\nWhen the news spread that the yeshiva was seeking a new home, many [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] communities extended a hand of welcome, but none were located in the north where the Chazon Ish had desired a yeshiva to be founded. Finally, a group of activists from the northern village of Kfar Hasidim petitioned the yeshiva and were accepted.\n\nWith the blessing of the Chazon Ish, the yeshiva purchased a {{convert|10|dunam}} lot on the outskirts of the village and five buildings containing a [[beth midrash]], dining hall, dormitories and offices. The yeshiva moved into its new home at the end of April 1955.<ref name=\"Meringer\" \/>\n\nFive days after the move, the Rosh Yeshiva, Rabbi Shimonowitz, died of a [[stroke]]. Rabbi Lopian took charge and appointed Shimonowitz's brother-in-law, Rabbi [[Raphael Eliyahu Eliezer Mishkovsky]], who was also the Rav of Kfar Hasidim, as the new rosh yeshiva.<ref name=marks>Marks, Yehudah. \"The Torah Empire of the North\", ''[[Hamodia]]'' Israel News, March 19, 2015, pp. 21-23.<\/ref>\n\nMishkovsky worked together with Lopian to shape and guide the yeshiva and its students.

The degree of membership of an individual i in the fuzzy class ~C is defined by the truth value of the corresponding fuzzy predicate.\n\n\u03bc~C(i):= \u03c4(~\u03a0(i))\n\n==Classification==\nIntuitively, a class is a set that is defined by a certain property, and all objects having that property are elements of that class. The process of classification evaluates for a given set of objects whether they fulfill the classification property, and consequentially are a member of the corresponding class. However, this intuitive concept has some logical subtleties that need clarification.\n\nA [[class logic]]<ref>Glubrecht, J.-M., Oberschelp, A., & Todt, G. (1983). Klassenlogik. Mannheim\/Wien\/Z\u00fcrich: Wissenschaftsverlag.<\/ref> is a logical system which supports set construction using logical predicates with the class operator { .| .}.

A classification corresponds to a membership function \u03bc that indicates whether an individual is a member of a class, given its classification predicate \u03a0.\n\n\u03bc\u2236PF \u00d7 U \u27f6 T\n\nThe membership function maps from the set of propositional functions PF and the universe of discourse U into the set of truth values T. The membership \u03bc of individual i in Class C is defined by the truth value \u03c4 of the classification predicate \u03a0.\n\n\u03bcC(i):=\u03c4(\u03a0(i))\n\nIn classical logic the truth values are certain. Therefore a classification is crisp, since the truth values are either exactly true or exactly false.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Fuzzy logic]]\n\n==References==\n<references\/>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fuzzy Classification}}\n[[Category:Fuzzy logic]]","timestamp":"20160410100507","user-timestamp":"20150410100507"},{"title":"Talk:Pemberton Ridge, New Brunswick","content":"{{WikiProject Canada|geography=yes|nb=yes|community=yes|class=stub|importance=low}}","timestamp":"20160410100508","user-timestamp":"20150410100508"},{"title":"Talk:Lowe, Kansas","content":"{{WikiProject Kansas|class=Stub|importance=Low}}","timestamp":"20160410100508","user-timestamp":"20150410100508"},{"title":"Talk:Bernard II, Duke of Saxony","content":"{{WikiProjectBannerShell|1=\n{{WikiProject Germany|class=stub|importance=low}}\n{{WikiProject Biography|living=no\n|class=Stub\n|royalty-work-group=yes\n|listas=Bernard 02, Duke Of Saxony\n}}\n{{WikiProject Middle Ages|class=Stub}}\n}}\n\n==Strange Statement==\n\"Though he was a critical ally of the Danes, so fundamental to Henry's wars in the Low Countries, Bernard was on the brink of rebellion until the death of Adalbert.

It is often set to deliver [[oxygen]] between 6-10 litres per minute. This mask is only meant for patients who are able to breathe on their own, but who may require a higher oxygen concentration than the 21% concentration found in ambient air. Patients who are unable to breathe on their own are placed on a [[medical ventilator]] instead.\n\nThe final oxygen concentration delivered by a simple face mask is dependent upon the amount of room air that mixes with the oxygen the patient breathes.  The air mixing is determined by how much air any individual is breathing at the moment, combined with the fit of the mask. Because of the variability in these factors, the final oxygen concentration is uncontrolled. A [[venturi mask|venturi]] device attached to the mask can be used to control to some degree the concentration of oxygen delivered, usually this is used to prevent respiratory depression in [[emphysema]] patients who have lost the ability to fully [[Inhalation|inhale]]<!--I'm guessing on everything in the sentence following the word \"the\", because the source text from [[Oxygen therapy]] is incomplete, please fix if you can-->.

It is operational in [[Gurgaon]], a district in state of Haryana, adjacent to [[New Delhi]], the capital of [[India]]. Most of the activities of the AID-Gurgaon Chapter is in the field of education, although it has a close association with [[AID Delhi]][http:\/\/delhi.aidindia.org\/bethechange\/] which is a much bigger chapter in terms of volunteers and scope of projects.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe seeds of AID-Gurgaon were sown in early 2007. AID-Gurgaon started as a group of working professionals who came together to make a difference to the glaring rich-poor divide that engulfs this modern fast-developing city. Inspired by the model of Mobile Creches[http:\/\/www.mobilecreches.org\/about.htm], which is an organization providing day-care centers for children of construction workers at construction sites across the National Capital Region of India(and few other cities), the volunteers started the first project of AID-Gurgaon on 26 January, 2007 and named it '''''Unnati''''' (meaning progress).\n\n== Ideology ==\nAID-Gurgaon being a chapter of AID-India, follows the same ideology of '''''Sangharsh, Seva and Nirman''''', meaning Struggle, Service and Development. Sangharsh is reflected in the efforts of the volunteers to run day to day activities of the organization. Service and Development are embodied in the educational projects and an awareness campaign being run by the organization.\n\n== Structure and Volunteers==\nAID-Gurgaon being a completely volunteer driven organization is not very rigid in its structure. However, there are a few important positions\/groups that are important for its smooth running:\n\n1. '''Chapter coordinator''' - Responsible for the overall administration and smooth running of all the projects, resolving any roadblocks and discrepancies at any stage of a project and assigning responsibilities for major tasks to the fellow volunteers.\n\n2. '''Project coordinator''' - Individual projects are the responsibilities of atleast one person. However, due to fewer projects, there are often more than one Project coordinator for a project.\n\n3. '''Website coordinator''' - Responsible for the maintenance and upto date information of all important events on AID-Gurgaon website[http:\/\/gurgaon.aidindia.org\/].\n\n4. '''Treasurer''' - Responsible for maintaining the constant flow of funds to and from AID-Gurgaon.\n\n== Projects ==\nAID-Gurgaon has the following projects running actively:\n\n1. '''Unnati''' - The first project of AID-Gurgaon, started in January 2007, it is a school being run at Jharsa Village of Gurgaon. The school targets children of construction laborers and rag-pickers and provides '''''non-formal''''' education to the students. The school is fully funded by AID-Gurgaon and runs six days a week with a regular experienced teacher.\n\n2. '''Disha''' - Disha is a recently opened (January 2009) school, also located in Jharsa Village of Gurgaon. It is run on the similar lines of Unnati.\n\n3. '''RSEP''' - Stands for Regular School Education Program. This program is intended to promote the students who have been regular to the non-formal education system provided by Unnati and Disha to regular private and semi-private schools.\n\n4. '''Srijan''' - An awareness campaign with a goal to make Gurgaon a Beggar-free town.\n\nFor more information on the above projects, see the official AID-Gurgaon webiste[http:\/\/gurgaon.aidindia.org\/]\n\n== Activities and Events ==\nRegular activities of AID-Gurgaon involve:\n\n1. Regular school visit to Unnati and Disha by volunteers (frequency: every weekend)\n\n2. Regular ''basti'' (slum) visit to meet the children and their parents in order to keep both of them motivated for their education.\n\n3. Campaigning activities - online and door to door for Srijan project.\n\nSome other important events include:\n\n1. Republic Day and Unnati\/Disha Birthday celebrations event\n\n2.

Uncovering the molecular secret of the gene in question \u2014 that for the capsular polysaccharide of pneumococcal bacteria \u2014 led the way to studying heredity not only through genetics but also through chemistry, and initiated the dawn of the age of molecular biology. McCarty was the youngest and longest surviving member of the research team responsible for this feat (known as the [[Avery\u2013MacLeod\u2013McCarty experiment]]), which also included [[Oswald T. Avery]] and [[Colin Munro MacLeod|Colin MacLeod]]; he died on January 2, 2005, from congestive heart failure.\n\n==Life==\nMcCarty was born in 1911 in [[South Bend, Indiana]], the second of four sons of a branch manager for the Studebaker Corporation while it was still a firm for horse-drawn carriages. In his teens, McCarty set himself the goal of becoming a physician-scientist, and he pursued a successful strategy to prepare for admission to, and early success in, [[Johns Hopkins University]] Medical School. As an undergraduate at [[Stanford University]], he presciently began his studies in the nascent field of [[biochemistry]], working with James Murray Luck on protein turnover in the liver. In 1937, he began his clinical training in pediatrics at the Harriet Lane Service at Johns Hopkins University. There McCarty developed a special interest in infectious diseases \u2014 in particular, antibacterial sulfonamide drug treatments that were just entering medicine \u2014 which he subsequently pursued by moving to [[New York University]] to work with William Tillett. A [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] Fellowship in the medical sciences and an opening in Oswald T. Avery's laboratory spurred his move to [[Rockefeller University]] in 1941.\n\nAt that time, research in the Avery laboratory was focused on the pneumococcal transformation, the heritable alteration of a pneumococcal strain from a nonvirulent rough form to a virulent smooth encapsulated form. McCarty's arrival at the Rockefeller Institute in September 1941 marked 13 years since this discovery, also known as the [[Frederick Griffith|Griffith phenomenon]]. Prior to this discovery, the 1920s had been marked by a medley of disparate observations on [[Streptococcus pneumoniae]] that seemed to involve an exchange of receptors among diverse bacteria either grown together in liquid media or exposed to various kinds of extracts and supernatants. With rare exception, the early researchers in this area were utterly confused about the distinction between [[genotype]] and [[phenotype]]. No single experiment was carried forward to confirmation by other observers, so the entire field of \"para agglutination\" was in some disrepute.\n\nHowever, in 1928, Fred Griffith, a leader in public-health research in Britain, demonstrated that the conversion of one strain to another could happen in vivo in mice. Shortly after the publication of his results, they were confirmed in several quarters, including Avery's lab. The analysis relied on serotyping: it was known that phenotypic differentiation of pneumoccocal groups could be diagnosed by their reactions with specific antisera, already recognized to reflect chemically distinct capsular polysaccharides. Griffith had neither the resources nor the inclination to purify and identify the responsible agent in pneumococcal extracts that induced the changes of serotype. But the phenomenon of transformation was at least vaguely understood to comprise an alteration of what we would now call genetic factors.\n\nThough interrupted, sometimes for years at a time, these studies were from 1928 onwards the centerpiece of Avery's lab agenda. Around 1940, they were activated by Colin MacLeod's efforts to purify the chemical agent responsible for changes of [[serotype]] \u2014 whether [[protein]], [[nucleic acid]], or some other class of molecule \u2014 and demonstrate that it was necessary and sufficient to cause the Griffith phenomenon. Studies on pneumococcal transformation were grossly burdened by a wide variety of variables, which needed to be controlled to allow quantitative estimation of transforming activity in extracts undergoing various stages of purification. MacLeod, over a number of years of research, had resolved several thorny technical issues to render the experimental system somewhat more reliable as an assay for biological activity. By the time McCarty arrived at the Rockefeller University, Avery's team had just about decided that the active reagent was not a protein. But what was it then? Could it be a soluble saccharide, [[RNA]], or, least likely, [[DNA]]? The progress of this research over the next three years is beautifully described in McCarty's memoir ''The Transforming Principle'', written in the early 1980s<ref>McCarty M (1985) The transforming principle: Discovering that genes are made of DNA. New York: W. W. Norton. 252 p. ISBN 0-393-30450-7.<\/ref>\n\nAs purification progressed, exposure of extracts to crystalline RNase and to proteinase preparations helped Avery's team determine that the biological activity of extracts was not dependent on RNA or protein. Crystalline DNase was not available until 1948, but biological activity was rapidly reduced by tissue extracts rich in DNase. McCarty's arrival at Rockefeller University was also marked by another milestone, namely, the development of a diphenylamine reagent assay to positively correlate DNA with biological activity. It gradually became evident that the active material in purified extracts had astonishingly high potency in micrograms of DNA that could consummate the pneumococcal transformation in vitro.\n\nMcCarty, MacLeod, and Avery wrestled with the standard of proof required to claim that they had accomplished pneumococcal transformation with highly purified DNA from extracts. After much self-inquiry, in 1944, they published in the [[Journal of Experimental Medicine]] that the active material was DNA,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Avery|first1=Oswald T.|last2=MacLeod|first2=Colin M.|last3=McCarty|first3=Maclyn|title=Studies on the Chemical Nature of the Substance Inducing Transformation of Pneumococcal Types - Induction of Transformation by a Desoxyribonucleic Acid Fraction Isolated from Pneumococcus Type III|journal=Journal of Experimental Medicine|date=February 1, 1944|volume=79|issue=2|pages=137-158|pmid=19871359|url=https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2135445\/pdf\/137.pdf|accessdate=10 March 2016}}<\/ref> bereft of protein or any other known polymer.<ref>McCarty M, Avery OT (1946) Studies on the chemical nature of the substance inducing transformation of pneumococcal types. 2.

London: Macmillan. 510 p.<\/ref> The claim was, indeed, subject to a formidable, but predictable, round of organized skepticism. Some would say, even worse, that it was simply ignored, but that is manifestly untrue, at least in the case of the New York research institutions. The scientific community does not accept major scientific claims with ease, and in this case, there were challenges associated with research on S. pneumoniae, which made it especially difficult to attract other investigators to pursue this research. To begin with, few people had the necessary expertise with this pathogen from a biological perspective \u2014 it was dangerous to work with, and at the same time, it was finicky to grow. In order to assay its virulence, one needed to use mice as a selective filter. Most critically lacking as corroboration was the examination of other phenotypic markers, besides the capsular polysaccharide, to determine the extent that the findings on the gene for one pneumococcal antigen would apply to other metabolic markers of S. pneumoniae.\n\nHowever, by 1953, influenced by the enormous impact of [[Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid|Watson and Crick's bihelical structure of DNA]], the majority of researchers had fully accepted the 1944 paper. In fact, one might say, formal proof that DNA encoded genetic material was approximated only much later by the laboratory synthesis of [[oligonucleotides]], and by the demonstration of genetic material's biological activity, for example, genes for tRNA or small DNA viruses. Long before this formal proof, most commentators had accepted the untrammeled heuristic value of the proposition that, indeed, genes were made of DNA.\n\nMeanwhile, a physician-scientist through and through, McCarty turned his attention to diseases promoted by [[streptococci]]. So it happened that on the retirement of Homer Swift in 1946, McCarty was asked to head the laboratory established in 1922 to work on streptococci and [[rheumatic fever]]. This was the scientific home of [[Rebecca Lancefield]], who developed the still powerful serological classification of streptococci. From innumerable clinical observations, combined with Lancefield's classification, it was clear that acute rheumatic fever, a severe sterile inflammatory condition affecting particularly the joints and the heart, was a complication of group A [[streptococcal pharyngitis]], following the infection by several weeks. The causal chain of events still eludes us. McCarty attacked this problem by studying both the biology of group A streptococci and patients with acute rheumatic fever admitted to the Rockefeller Hospital.\n\nTogether with his students and collaborators, over the next 20 years, McCarty's work changed the understanding of the organism from a gram-positive streptococcus with a particular serological characteristic to one of the best characterized bacterial species. Work on bacterial cell-wall anatomy and chemistry was just beginning. His work led to the isolation of the streptococcal cell wall as a structural entity suitable for anatomic inspection by [[Electron microscope|electronmicroscopy]]. Chemical dissection led to characterization of the group A\u2013specific [[polysaccharide]] and the [[peptidoglycan]], and the identification of its serological specificity in the terminal [[hexosamine]]. In order to prove this specificity, he first had to identify and purify a specific enzyme that cleaved hexosamine (a hexosaminidase) from a soil organism. Treating the polysaccharide with this enzyme abrogated its serological reactivity. McCarty further demonstrated the precise configuration of the hexosamine linkage by synthesizing both \u03b1- and \u03b2-N-acetyl-glucosamine ovalbumin and showing that only the second reacted with group A antisera. A similar analytical strategy indicated that the polysaccharide of group C streptococci differed by having a terminal \u03b2-N-acetyl galactosamine as the serological determinant.\n\nIn parallel, McCarty studied patients with rheumatic fever admitted to the Rockefeller Hospital as well as valuable specimen collections from military outbreaks of the disease during World War II. He and his collaborators found that antibody responses to several streptococcal antigens were significantly higher in the group of individuals that developed acute rheumatic fever than in individuals with uncomplicated infection. However, the response to unrelated [[antigen]]s, for instance, diphtheria toxoid, was not enhanced. He found that group A streptococci secreted unusually high amounts of DNase, and established a test for the detection of antibodies produced in response to this antigen. This led to the discovery that streptococci were able to produce multiple isozymes of DNase. He purified human C-reactive protein through crystallization, produced a highly specific antiserum, and, using this much simpler and more sensitive test, found that C-reactive protein levels responded more rapidly and reliably than other inflammatory markers and could serve as the most accurate indicator of rheumatic inflammatory activity. Measuring C-reactive protein levels to detect inflammation is routine now in medical practice.\n\nIn his later years, McCarty increasingly served as a statesman of the biomedical sciences. He served for 14 years as the physician-in-chief of the Rockefeller University Hospital, and as a trusted adviser and the vice president of the Rockefeller University. Outside the university, his leadership was sought by the New York City Health Research Council, the [[Helen Hay Whitney Foundation]], the [[Institute of Medicine]] (as a charter member), and numerous university visiting boards. For more than 40 years, as editor, he placed his stamp of excellence and integrity on the [[Journal of Experimental Medicine]].\n\nMcCarty's scientific interests and energy had a counterpart in his rich personal life. Along with his wife, Marjorie, McCarty had a wide circle of very close friends, both in the United States and abroad, who cherished his personal warmth, his low key, spare, and pragmatic character, his wit, and his wide-ranging intellect. He loved English literature, theater, and symphonies. He loved to wander the streets and the museums of the great cities of the world, particularly, Paris, New York, and London, and frequently visited overseas following his retirement. Moreover, he remained close to his family; the four brothers, living in different parts of the country, never failed to meet for annual reunions.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite journal|last1=Lederberg|first1=Joshua|last2=Gotschlich|first2=Emil C|title=A Path to Discovery: The Career of Maclyn McCarty|journal=PLoS Biology|date=2005|volume=3|issue=10|pages=e341|doi=10.1371\/journal.pbio.0030341}}\n{{CC-notice|cc=by2|url=http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosbiology\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pbio.0030341|author(s)=Joshua Lederberg and Emil C Gotschlich}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2005\/01\/06\/obituaries\/06McCarty.html ''New York Times'' obituary]\n* {{Wayback |date=20050407123439 |url=http:\/\/www.rockefeller.edu\/pubinfo\/010305.php |title=News release from Rockefeller University }}\n* [http:\/\/www.rockefeller.edu\/discovery\/dna\/index.php When was DNA proved to be the chemical basis of heredity?]\n*{{cite news|last=Holley|first=Joe|title=Pioneering Geneticist Maclyn McCarty Dies|url=http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-dyn\/articles\/A51934-2005Jan5.html|accessdate=23 October 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=January 6, 2005}}\n{{Wolf Prize in Medicine}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McCarty, Maclyn}}\n[[Category:1911 births]]\n[[Category:2005 deaths]]\n[[Category:American geneticists]]\n[[Category:Molecular biologists]]\n[[Category:Wolf Prize in Medicine laureates]]\n[[Category:Rockefeller University people]]\n[[Category:Members of the National Academy of Medicine]]\n[[Category:People from South Bend, Indiana]]","timestamp":"20160410100526","user-timestamp":"20150410100526"},{"title":"Wikipedia:WikiProject Spam\/LinkReports\/tri-stateemergencyteam.org","content":"<!--Please do not comment or change this page, it is bot generated and will be completely regenerated by the bot.

The 1970s, early 1970s in particular, were far more violent and far more deaths and injuries were caused. Therefore to include an incomplete figure in the lead suggests to the reader that the number of injuries would be similar for the years not listed. There is no possible argument to counter that, it is misleading period. Unless that is, the figure is included at the relevant point in the article and not in the lead. Which is what's been said for hours now, but it is irrelevant to the information being removed from the lead. It is now beyond a joke that having been presented with evidence that the article is incorrect, that nobody is actually prepared to remove the offending information, hiding behind a \"get consensus for it\" argument. So I ask you, where was the consensus for the information to be added in the first place?! [[User:O Fenian|O Fenian]] ([[User talk:O Fenian|talk]]) 19:41, 7 August 2009 (UTC)\n\n::So in conclusion are the estimates we have for death or injury at 20,000 people of which \"over\" 14,000 of these being civilians, is that under or overestimated ? If OBrien is a poor source then why not use Sinn fein [http:\/\/www.sinnfein.ie\/contents\/15212] who says \"3,000 people have been killed, and 30,000 injured\". Now it could be that they are talking these figures up or down, either way we are close enough for the time being and I think we're in the right ball park.

The rest of your post is pointless. The SF figures are the total figures killed or injured by everyone (and can be better sourced elswhere), what are required are the total figure injured by the IRA. So yes your argument, or the one you have just presented, holds no weight.

If Yes and as we do not state the actual year in the lead that the figures apply for (only a more encompassing range of 1969 and 1997) then no Wikipedia reader will ever do the maths in their head to extrapolate whatever trend could be construed. If No then do we over or under estimate the figures OBrien claims ?. If we overestimate then that is wrong, but if we underestimate then we can keep the word \"over\" in place.

I would have thought that the next step would have been to do that rather than attacking the admins and the other editors pre-emptively. I suspect that the option of agreeing to an amicable revert has expired simply through sheer poor judgement by some so therefore the alternative is to track down the actual 1969 and 1997 figures. If the actual figures are at odds with the current edits then the lead should change. In other words though, as an unattached and new editor to this article I'm going to support some death and injury figures in the lead as I think they are germane to the classification, and the effectiveness, of the subject (FWIW my route to this article was I created the stub article of [[List of encyclicals of Pope Pius VI]] and so wandered to other Papal Bulls to see how to fill the few English language examples out then I noticed [[Laudabiliter]] as the Papal bull of the only English Pope and from looking at how the editors handled editing I noticed this fine article. As an aside I too think it would be the misleading to combine death and injury though technically \"casualties\" include both dead and injured though I would prefer if we broke the figures out.

If you can find a reliable source that says that then you could try though I would doubt you could find one that said 20 persons for those events. Even the Holocaust deniers place the numbers in the many thousands. Here though we have a reliable source that says the numbers that we use so I don't think you are arguing the numbers are wrong but you are arguing that the time frame we quote is imprecise. That's not really that much of a problem I think.\n:::::::::As I mentioned the opportunity to remove all mention of casualties in the lead was lost for whatever reason and the consensus that is developing is to include the figures for the casualties (ideally broken out into deaths and injuries) in the lead.

A few points to consider:\n*Should the casualties section be summarized in the lead?  If so, what would a brief and neutral casualties statement include?\n*Should this material (or something along these lines) move down into the body of the article and be covered in more depth?

Despite this, he continues to debate his proposed text for the next 24 hours. At [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army&diff=prev&oldid=307372060 15:05, 11 August 2009] I say there is no proposed text, since it has been rejected.

The problem is that my opinion counts for more than Mooretwin's about whether it is supported by the source, because MOORETWIN HAS NOT SEEN THE SOURCE. How do I know this? There is no way the proposed text would be worded that way if he had. So there are two options for this to be resolved;\n#Mooretwin can immediately produce the exact text from O'Brien and also say where O'Brien got the information from, both of which are in the source.

It is one of several organisations calling themselves the IRA (see List of IRAs). The Provisionals' constitution establishes them as \u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann (\"The Irish Volunteers\") in the Irish language. The Provisional Irish Republican Army is sometimes referred to as the PIRA, the Provos, or by some of its supporters as the Army or the 'RA.\n\nThe IRA's stated objective is to end \"British rule in Ireland,\" and according to its constitution, it wants \"to establish an Irish Socialist Republic, based on the Proclamation of 1916.\" Until the 1998 Belfast Agreement, it sought to end Northern Ireland's status within the United Kingdom and bring about a united Ireland by force of arms and political persuasion. Between, 1969 and 1998, the IRA conducted an armed campaign against British and loyalist forces, killing approximately 1,800 people, including approximately 620 civilians. An internal British Army document released in 2007 describes the IRA as \"professional, dedicated, highly skilled and resilient.\"\n\nOn 28 July 2005, the IRA Army Council announced an end to its armed campaign, stating that it would work to achieve its aims using \"purely political and democratic programmes through exclusively peaceful means\". The organisation is classified as a proscribed terrorist group in the United Kingdom and as an illegal organisation in the Republic of Ireland.\n\n''((Is there support for this attempt or should we stick to the one controversial sentence?''

Oh sorry, that can't be acknowledged as it doesn't legitimise the IRA campaign in the same way as the weasel words in the article do.

Equally strange is that despite editors asserting that the lead of this article should contain details of casualties, that the UDA, UVF and a number of related articles do not contain such information, perhaps their agenda does not include the addition of comparable information to those articles, after all they have had ample opportunity to achieve parity yet have failed to attempt it.

Thus the lead would read as a mildly expanded version of:  \"The PIRA was a [WHAT] that operated in [PLACE] from [DATE] to [DATE].  It sought to achieve [GOAL] through the use of [MEANS].\"   While the lead will not be this compact, I believe that any information not covered by these criteria will inevitably lead to intractable conflict, and thus should not be included.  That means no casualty estimates, no \"professional, disciplined, yadda yadda\".  Remember, the focus of the article is the organization, not the campaign.  There is plenty of room within the article itself to discuss any and all contentious issues raised in this discussion.  Once again, the lead of the article should not be a place where either side attempts to espouse its ideology.  Any properly sourced facts and figures should be included in the appropriate sections of the body. [[User:Throwaway85|Throwaway85]] ([[User talk:Throwaway85|talk]]) 05:03, 19 August 2009 (UTC)\n\nUp until now, the lead for this article has read like a press release for the PIRA, which I guess is the reason that we have such vociferous objections to including a documented fact about this organsition within the lead. It is not pushing an ideology to state how many the PIRA killed and injured, it's simply presenting a major fact about this organisations achievements. The only real issue, is ensuring we have the correct verifiable figures - which is easily done for those killed, not so easily done for those injured. Numerous suggestions have been put forward with regards to re-wording the \"contentious\" sentance, but these suggestions have been met with tantrums and abuse, so what do we do ? Until such time as those objecting to the statement can behave themselves and work towards an agreement on wording, we are stuck with what we have.  <span style=\"font-size: smaller;\" class=\"autosigned\">\u2014Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions\/86.133.101.139|86.133.101.139]] ([[User talk:86.133.101.139|talk]]) 07:39, 19 August 2009 (UTC)<\/span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\n:Not exactly stuck with it, rather it's time to progress to [[WP:RFC]] as discussion here has not done anything, and mediation seems completely unlikely as it's been stated by a few that they wouldn't participate.

The problem is not a lack of ideas, but rather an overabundance of opinions.  Neither the vitriolic attacks, the petty edit wars, nor the pushing of extreme biases will cease with the introduction of more voices.  Republicans tend to view the PIRA as a legitimate resistance force, Unioinists as a murderous terrorist organization.  There can be no compromise between these two strongly held beliefs.  Having followed the discussion, it is clear that there are editors on both sides of the debate who are more interested in \"winning\" than in the integrity of the article.\n\n::With all of Jimbo's army of admins, you would think someone would have the power to simply make an executive decision.  It's not hard to see the reasonable course of action here:  To maintain WP:NPOV, simply remove or alter the statements which have an evident bias.  If a source cannot be confirmed, then it is not reliable, and thus any statement referring to that source should be excised until such time as the reliability of the source is ascertained.  The current decision, to leave the page protected while there are clear flaws with it while insisting that people come to a laughably impossible consensus is either shortsighted or deliberately obstinate.

I simply think that, unless we can agree on what constitutes an unbiased introduction that includes these facts, which I think unlikely, it should be as emotionally neutral as possible.\n:I'll state my bias clearly:  My family is Irish Catholic, and I have strong Republican leanings.  That doesn't mean that I think the sun shone out of the PIRA's ***.  Regardless, our personal views are of less importance than fixing the article.  As it stands, the current statement of casualties is deeply flawed.  There seems to be no possibility of achieving consensus on that issue at the moment.  My suggestion: take it out until we have a suitable replacement.  Similarly, I think the \"professional, dedicated, etc\" line is not a vital part of an introductory paragraph to the PIRA.

So I cannot do that.\n\nThe problems are quite simple:\n\n*The original sentence which was copied to the lead (complete with egregious modifications of the original sentence to mean something completely different!) did not match the source, and is therefore unsourced.\n*It is impossible to construct an accurate, non-misleading sentence that belongs in the lead of the article from that source.\n*Various editors have produced no sources at all to support any figures about injuries or opinions they have said should be included in the lead.\n*Various editors refuse to allow an unsourced (as the text does not match the source in any way) sentence to be removed from the article. They are so insistent on retaining an incorrect, unsourced sentence. Not only that, they keep proposing equally incorrect, unsourced sentences that either cite zero sources or inaccurately cite the existing source.\n*I have asked many times why the reader should be misled. It is quite telling that nobody dare give me a straight policy based answer to that question, especially when the protection policy allows for its removal.\n*It is impossible to have a discussion when other editors repeatedly insist certain information should be included in the lead, while providing zero sources for the information they wish to have included.

I have a big problem with this, The idea people should have to read more than half the article before they come across any figures on deaths \/ injuries caused by this group seems to be hiding important information from the reader. \n\nFor over a week editors who demand the sentence be removed have failed to engage in trying to reword the sentence, have failed to explain exactly how the current sentence is incorrect and have generally been agressive and attacked admins here for their actions. Im happy for us to find a different source and completly reword the sentence, but we can not just remove a sentence because a few editors make claims about it they fail to back up and refuse to engage in rewording it. Without that one sentence in the introduction, the intro is clearly presenting no information about what this group actually DID making it very biased. Its a paramilitary group illegal in Ireland, decribed as a terrorist group by the UK that was willing to use violence to push political aims. No where (except that final sentence) does it explain WHAT they did or the results of what they did which was to kill and wound 1000s of people.

And on top of all of that, to have his edits locked into an article by the admin.\n\n*By way of example, the British Army, who have killed probably millions of people does not have an \"tally\" in its lead, or even in the body of the article for that matter. Wikipedia must be a 'NPOV level playing field', if it is to be of any value.\n\n*And, admin Nja247, who locked the article in favour of the IP edits, seems to have 'new issues' that would question his actions on the article page.\n\n*The article should be unlocked, and the IP's edits should be discussed per norm, and not \"protected\" per ab-norm.\n[[User:Tfz|<font color=\"Blue\" face=\"Comic sans\">''Tfz''<\/font>]] [[User talk:Tfz|<font color=\"Blue\"> <small><\/small> <\/font>]] 22:41, 19 August 2009 (UTC)\n\n====Comments by Sam Blacketer====\nOpinions from someone not involved in the dispute. I think the sentence as proposed cannot stand, for several reasons. Firstly, although this is somewhat banal, the source given as an external hyperlink to another Wikipedia article is manifestly inappropriate; if the source is really O'Brien's \"The Long War\" at pages 135-6, then that should be the source given. Secondly, the lumping together of both those killed and injured as \"casualties\" is inappropriate. That is what is done in military articles because it is a measure of the reduction of the strength of an army - soldiers who are killed and injured are alike unable to continue to fight. However in this case the point being made is that those killed and injured were not in opposing armies, but mostly civilians. In civilian life the difference between being killed and injured is considered very great and they should not be put together if it is at all possible to make a distinction - which it undoubtedly is here. Thirdly, the sentence raises but does not answer the question of how exactly 'civilian' is defined. Members of the RUC were civilians in the sense of being in an institution of the civil power. Members of loyalist paramilitary groups were civilians, and in many cases there must be uncertainty about who exactly was in a paramilitary group and who was not. Without deeper explanation the sentence as proposed is not helpful.\n\nI can see some need for a reference in the lede to the numbers killed by the PIRA, but not in this form. If it were generally desired, a better statistic might be to adapt the table in 'Lost Lives'. I think my edition is not quite the latest but table 20 on page 1504 of the 2001 edition identifies 1,778 people killed by the IRA, of which 642 were civilians under its definition.

OBviously in the case of this article protection and vigilance is needed on all sides for the article itself.  But censorship of the Discussion page?????  Is this serious????  Is Wikipedia only allowed to be edited, commented upon by those who deem themselves the defenders of their precious little articles?  <span style=\"font-size: smaller;\" class=\"autosigned\">\u2014Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions\/80.254.147.52|80.254.147.52]] ([[User talk:80.254.147.52|talk]]) 14:16, 21 August 2009 (UTC)<\/span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\n\n===Admin===\nOK, since people are calling for an (uninvolved) admin, I'm going to try and help. Some points and questions.\n* [[WP:ADMINS|admins]] have no special status for mediating disputes. Experienced, previously uninvolved editors are needed for that, many of whom are not admins. Admins are authorised to have access to special tools, not to settle debates.\n* Tempers have got heated here, but can everyone make a super-human effort to put that aside, wipe the slate clean, and try and focus on the content issues? Otherwise this isn't going to work. Suggestion: try and keep the moral high ground - let others drag the conversation into the mud if they must (and try not to follow them). [[WP:AGF]], [[WP:CIVIL]] and [[WP:NPA]] aren't there for fun, they're essential for debate on difficult topics to work. And please please try not drag up \"he said\"-\"she said\"s - try and let bygones be bygones.\n\nOK, on to the substance.\n* The current (protected) version of the article contains the following sentence which I gather is the nub of the dispute: \"It is estimated that between 1969 and 1997, the IRA was responsible for the death or injury of over 20,000 people: over 14,000 of these being civilians. [11]\" Footnote 11 links to a footnote in an another Wikipedia article ([[Provisional IRA campaign 1969\u20131997]]), which as Sam Blacketer noted above, is just not good enough. I can't even figure out what the ref is supposed to be, and it wouldn't be good enough even if it was clear. Refs must be contained within the article, not on other Wikipedia pages.\n* As noted also by Sam Blacketer, mixing death and injury is not a good idea. It is neither helpful for the reader nor [[WP:NPOV]]-compatible.\n* I suggest that we need 4 numbers from each source, total death and injury and subtotal civilian death and injury. \n* Drawing on what it says in [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969\u20131997#Casualties]], we can take the two main sources there (A - University of Ulster and B - Lost Lives) and generalise for the lede (can have more detail in the body perhaps, but obviously less than in the campaign article). A says 1,821 deaths up to 2001, with 621 civilian; B says 1,781 deaths to 2004, with 644 civilian. We can summarise that as \"From 1969 - 2004, around 1800 deaths of which around 630 were civilians.\" The exact stats from each source can be given in the footnote to the sentence.\n* Currently no details on injuries - where does the 20,000 figure come from? We need sources for this - or extracting this detail from sources A and B if they have it.\n* Addendum: I've omitted the issue of whether the numbers should be in the lede at all; but I see now this is an issue too. So it may be the summary sentence should go in the body. it would probably be less controversial in the lede as part of a paragraph more generally summarising IRA strength and activities, including estimates of its own casualties.\n\nOnwards! We can sort this out. [[User:Rd232|Rd232]] <sup>[[user talk:rd232|talk]]<\/sup> 17:29, 21 August 2009 (UTC)\n: I can support removing the current sentence and replacing it with the death toll figure.

For all we know this terrorist group went around doggynapping loyalists pets. I can understand concerns with the current sentence and the fact there appears to be very few reliable sources on the injuries, but i see no reason why the deaths this group is responsible for should not be mentioned in the intro and to ensure its neutral im even prepared to support wording where it mentions over all deaths so like \"of the **** killed in the troubles, PIRA is believed to be responsible for...\" Something along those lines. I think thats pretty reasonable.

First of all its clear from the above discussion that i have not been the only person saying the current sentence should remain in the intro until agreement reached on what replaces it. 2 others have said the same and im not sure giving people less than 24 hours to respond is enough time, its also clear from other peoples comments here the request for the deaths caused by this group to be mentioned in the intro doesnt seem too unreasonable to genuine uninvolved editors provided there is an accurate and reliable source and its worded well.\n:: This redrafting sounds like a good idea but who exactly is going to be taking part in this redrafting? Apart from removing the one sentence many of the editors here dont seem to have a problem with the introduction even though it could clearly do with alot of improvements. I can not rewrite this introduction and even if i could it would obviously have clear neutrality concerns because of my point of view on these matters. \n:: I could do the sentence covering the deaths and suggest it there or here before tomorrow. That way the bad sentence can be removed and a neutral one readded, but its clear certain people here oppose the idea of any mention of deaths in the introduction.. so how do we get past this? What happens if you remove the sentence and in a weeks time all that has changed on the draft is me adding the new sentence on deaths which others reject? We will be in exactly the same position with the article locked but clearly presenting a biased introduction which provides very little information for the reader. \n:: Would it not be better for all of us to come up with our own sentence we think is reasonable to replace that sentence, then attempt to agree on which one is the best and then replace it. This \"temporary removal\" of important information (even if its worded very badly) will just be an excuse for no change to this article to take place in the future. That seems wrong. [[User:BritishWatcher|BritishWatcher]] ([[User talk:BritishWatcher|talk]]) 21:00, 21 August 2009 (UTC)\n:::Well, first of all, [[WP:DEADLINE]]. If the sentence isn't there for a week while the draft is worked on, the sky isn't going to fall on us. Second, the issue seems to be not merely the correctness of the sentence, but also the context, which is why I'm keen to move forward with a redraft which improves the context. Third, everyone should be working on the draft, and doing their best to put aside their POV concerns, aiming to collaboratively produce a good neutral summary of the article. Fourth, if that can't be achieved within a week, and there's little progress, then either I'll have a crack at it, or if time constraints don't permit me, we'll beg someone else uninvolved to volunteer. Fifth, let's just try and move forward. Otherwise we're at an impasse and we can put a tombstone on this article. [[User:Rd232|Rd232]] <sup>[[user talk:rd232|talk]]<\/sup> 21:31, 21 August 2009 (UTC)\n:::: I think trying to work on the entire intro is going to take alot longer than expected and be very problematic. Surely its better to focus on trying to sort out the sentence which causes the problem first by agreeing a reasonable alternative which is well sourced that can be replace the current sentence on the article. Then take time to see if progress is made on the redraft of the intro. Id like to see a show of hands of who will contribute to this redraft, because i dont think there will be many volunteers, even those who support this proposal. Which means at the end of the week you may stuck with wasting your time having to do everything yourself or passing it on to someone else.

Plenty of debate has occurred on other points, yet from the other side of the planet it appears that sources published 1997 or later would be more complete.  Is that a fair assessment?\n*In other wiki situations (Milhist pages, Israeli-Palestianian conflict) it often works out to cite both high and low figures when the reliable sources differ.  In areas where the conflict is sensitive, one solution has been to add text about who those sources are (as in \"the Palestinian Authority states X; the ''Jerusalem Post'' reports Y.)  Would that type of approach be acceptable here?\n*If the methodologies differ between sources, the text could describe those differ.  (Professor Soandso defines \"casualty\" as... The Office of Statistics uses the following definition...)  Could that basically be okay if the text doesn't try to skew the reader toward one or the other but just equips the reader to make up their own mind?\n*It also seems like a level of detail that belongs within the main article body.  With something much briefer in the lead.  Perhaps to say for the lead itself \"Casualty figures are disputed.\"  And then within the article describe what both sides of that dispute are.  Would that solution be basically acceptable to both sides?\n\nFrom down here where the palm trees grow, it seems that type of approach might be workable.  \nApologies in advance if unintentional bias colors any part of this post.

Points were awarded in each pool on a different scale from that used in most rugby tournaments: 3 for a win, 2 for a draw, 1 for a loss.\n\nHowever, new for 2012 was what was described by organisers as two separate 12-team competitions, called Competition 1 and Competition 2.<ref>[http:\/\/www.irbsevens.com\/destination\/edition=5\/eventinfo.html 2012 Hong Kong Sevens event info]<\/ref> Competition 1 contained the 12 core teams of the IRB Sevens circuit, who play in every event of the IRB Sevens circuit, in pools A, B and C.\n\nCompetition 2 contained 12 teams who had qualified through their performance in regional tournaments, in pools D, E and F. Four of these teams were from Asia; three from Europe; two from North America & Caribbean; one from Oceania; one from South America; and one from Africa.  This competition also doubled as a qualifying tournament for the 2012\u201313 IRB Sevens circuit, where the two Qualifier (Shield) finalists and the winner of the 3rd\/4th place playoff earned automatic participation in all events of the 2012\u201313 season. This resulted from the IRB's decision to increase the number of core teams to 15, effective in 2012\u201313.\n\nEight teams from Pools A, B and C, being the winners and runner-up from each pool, plus the best two 3rd placers, qualified for the Cup Quarter Finals. The losers of these Quarter Finals competed in the Plate Semifinals. The remaining four teams competed in the Bowl Semifinals.\n\nSimilarly, eight teams from Pools D, E and F qualified for the Qualifier (Shield) playoffs. The remaining four teams played in ranking matches.\n\n==Merchandising==\nFor this tournament, sportswear brand [[Kukri Sports]] teamed up with Hong Kong lifestyle retail store [[Goods of Desire|G.O.D.]] to produce merchandising.

The album was released at what was still considered to be the height of the outlaw movement in country music, and this was reflected in its chart success, with the LP peaking at #3 on the country charts, Jennings best showing since ''[[Love of the Common People]]'' in 1967.  Jennings produced it himself, although [[Ray Pennington]] co-produced \"Oklahoma Sunshine\" and \"[[I'm a Ramblin' Man]],\" the latter of which he also wrote.  Pennington recorded \"I'm a Ramblin' Man\" in 1967 for [[Capitol Records]] and took it to #29 on the country charts.<ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|date=2008|page=321|isbn=0-89820-177-2}}<\/ref>  Jennings' version would be his second #1 on the country chart and also appeared on Australian charts.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Billboard Book Of Top 40 Country Hits: 1944-2006, Second edition|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=174}}<\/ref>  \"[[Rainy Day Women]]\" was released in December 1974 as the second single from the album and reached  #2 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] chart.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Billboard Book Of Top 40 Country Hits: 1944-2006, Second edition|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=174}}<\/ref>  Curiously, the [[Bob McDill]] ballad \"[[Amanda (Don Williams song)|Amanda]]\" was not released as a single at this time; more than 4\u00bd years later, new overdubs were added to the original track and placed on his first greatest hits album.  The song was issued as a single and it became one of the biggest country hits of 1979.  \n\nThe album also includes a gutsy cover of the [[Allman Brothers]]' \"[[Midnight Rider]],\" cementing Jennings' fearless reputation as a leader of the \"progressive\" country sound.  The photo on the album cover was shot at Muhlenbrink's (formerly the Red Dog Saloon).\n\n==Reception==\n[[AllMusic]]: \"If he had created a sketch of outlaw on ''[[Honky Tonk Heroes]]'', he perfected the marketable version of it here, making it a little slicker, a little more commercial, and a whole lot more unstoppable. If the songs aren't the equal of ''Honky Tonk Heroes'' or even ''[[This Time (Waylon Jennings album)|This Time]]'', ''The Ramblin' Man'' has a wilder sound and a greater diversity of songs that make it seem more unruly than its immediate predecessor and more blatantly outlaw...There are moments of reflection, yet even those feed into the outlaw picture.\"\n\n==Track listing==\n#\"[[I'm a Ramblin' Man]]\" ([[Ray Pennington]]) \u2013 2:49\n#\"[[Rainy Day Woman]]\" (Jennings) \u2013 2:31\n#\"Cloudy Days\" (Billy Ray Reynolds) \u2013 2:41\n#\"[[Midnight Rider]]\" ([[Gregg Allman]]) \u2013 3:24\n#\"Oklahoma Sunshine\" (Hal Bynum, Bud Reneau) \u2013 3:29\n#\"The Hunger\" (Lee Fry) \u2013 3:31\n#\"I Can't Keep My Hands Off of You\" ([[Bobby Borchers]], [[Mack Vickery]]) \u2013 3:38\n#\"Memories of You and I\" ([[Lee Clayton]]) \u2013 4:16\n#\"It'll Be Her\" (Reynolds) \u2013 3:03\n#\"[[Amanda (Don Williams song)|Amanda]]\" ([[Bob McDill]]) \u2013 2:56\n\n===Bonus tracks===\n#\"Got a Lot Going for Me\" (Dave Kirby) \u2013 2:32\n#\"[[The Last Letter]]\" (Rex Griffin) \u2013 4:07\n#\"The One I Sing My Love Song To\" ([[Wayland Holyfield]]) \u2013 2:49\n\n==Personnel==\n\n*Joe Allen - bass\n*Leon Rhodes - bass \n*Larrie Londin - drums \n*Richie Albright - drums\n*Larry Whitmore - rhythm Guitar\n*Dave Dirby - electric Guitar \n*Thomas Jackson - fiddle \n*Waylon Jennings - guitar, vocals, production\n*Alfred Newell - guitar\n*Billy Ray Reynolds - guitar\n*Kyle Lehning - piano, engineer\n*Bunky Keels - piano\n*Carl Gay - guitar\n*Duke Goff - guitar\n*Randy Scruggs - guitar\n*John W.

New York|Wykagyl Park]]\n<\/imagemap>\n\n[[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]] occupies an area of roughly 10.5 square miles in [[Southern Westchester|Southern Westchester \nCounty]], bounded on the south by [[Long Island Sound]]; on the west by [[Pelham Manor]], [[Pelham (village), New York|Pelham]] and [[Eastchester]]; on the north by [[Scarsdale]]; and on the east by Scarsdale, [[Mamaroneck]] and [[Larchmont]]. For nearly two centuries from its settlement in 1688, New Rochelle was a quiet farming community with a bustling water dependent commercial center. Its proximity to the Sound had resulted in a booming resort trade by the late 1800s and wealthy Manhattanites flocked to the city's shores for recreation and relaxation. In 1889, The Town and Village of New Rochelle were incorporated as one city with a population of 14,000 residents. Just three decades later, New Rochelle's population had grown to over 54,000, having become one of the most sought after suburban communities in the country over 54,000. The community's expansion of infrastructure and neighborhoods kept pace with the mushrooming population. These early suburban neighborhoods were extremely popular with commuters, a new segment of American society choosing to live outside of the urban center and travel in daily for work. Developers immediately set to the task of providing them with fine homes and desirable communities on the waiting large tracts of farmland. Beginning with the southern tier of town, planned residential communities spread across the City, ultimately earning it the nickname \"City of Homes\".\n\nThe natural beauty and diverse geography of the area greatly influenced the primarily residential development of throughout most of the city, evidenced by the more than fifty 'residential parks' found today. Some of the country's most expensive residential real estate can be found in New Rochelle as well: The [[Wykagyl (New York)|Wykagyl]] 10804 postal code covering much of the city's north end is ranked on ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine's annual '500 most expensive zip-codes' list, with an average household income of $199,061 and an average home price over $752,000. In the city's southern end, homes in the gated waterfront enclave Premium Point can cost anywhere from $2 to $20 million.\n\nThe Downtown and South End, in contrast, are quite densely populated, with many multi-family residential complexes and high rise apartment buildings. There are more than 11,500 single family units within the city, more than neighboring Larchmont, Mamaroneck and Scarsdale combined. The total number of households surpasses 26,000, more than that of neighboring Pelham, Pelham Manor, Eastchester, Scarsdale, Mamaroneck and Larchmont combined.\n\nThe city is served by zip-codes 10801, 10802, 10804, 10805 and 10583.\n\n==City==\n[[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]] -

The small hamlet of Cooper's Corner served as the satellite to the downtown area for farmers living in the area. The real estate group that purchased all of the farmland to create the neighborhood were motivated by the construction of the New York-Westchester-Boston Railroad line and creation of a Wykagyl station nearby for potential commuters. The railroad was responsible for the growth of Wykagyl, its business district, and many of the large residential parks in the area.(Main thoroughfares: Buell Drive, Decatur Terrace, Evans Road, Fairman Drive, Farragut Road, Fenimore Road, Graham Road, Mildred Parkway, Lovell Road)\n* '''Chatsworth''': middle-class residential neighborhood adjacent to the City Park athletic fields.

The north end property was once the \"Great\", Daisy Farms, a working farm and  equestrian estate ( home to the Hutchinson Riding Academy ), situated east of the old Wilmot Road leading to Scarsdale.   The farm, owned by Adrian Iselin, Jr., became the centerpiece of the Adelin Property Corporation - hundreds of adjacent acres amassed by the millionaire in the 1920s in preparation for new development following the community's steady growth northward. This, however, did not happen for several decades due to the Great Depression and World War II. The Berne Construction Company of White Plains acquired the property in 1951 on which it constructed over 300 single family ranch style homes of spacious lots. A 12-acre parcel was acquired by the City for a North End School, the present day George M. Davis Elementary.  \n* '''[[Davenport Neck (New York)|Davenport Neck]]''': historic waterfront peninsula originally inhabited by Siwanoy Indian tribes in the 1500s and 1600s.

It was developed by the Iselin family as affordable housing for the City's blue-collar working class population. This particular neighborhood contains the City's highest concentration of American Foursquares.\n* '''Twin Lakes \/ Nature Study Woods''': residential neighborhood located in the northwestern corner of the City and is bounded by Eastchester Road on the south, North Avenue on the east, and the Hutchinson River on the west. It contains a mixture of architectural types, generally dating from the 1920s, including a significant concentration of Colonial and Tudor Revival-style homes built onto small lots laid out in an overall grid pattern. Many of the streets contain speculative houses built by contractors and developers of the day. A small number of homes from the City's early history are found within this area, remnants from the era prior to the creation of residential neighborhoods through subdivision. Included among these is the Parcot-Drake House.\n* '''Vaneck Estates'''\n* '''Victory Park''':<ref>[http:\/\/newyork.hometownlocator.com\/ny\/westchester\/victory-park.cfm NY HomeTownLocator Community Profile]<\/ref><ref>[http:\/\/newyork.hometownlocator.com\/maps\/bigmap,n,victory%20park,fid,968537.cfm Victory Park map]<\/ref>\n* '''Ward Acres''' (or '''Ward Acres Homes'''): residential community adjacent to the Ward Acres forest and preservation area.

It is defined by small building lots with little green space as compared to many other neighborhoods in the City. Most of the neighborhood sits on a hill, which in the early days of New Rochelle was known as Dutch Hill, leading to the terminology of saying someone is \"from up the West End\". The neighborhood is and has traditionally been home to one of the area's larger immigrant populations, with the Italian immigrants coming from 1900 through the 1950s and more recently the Hispanic immigrants coming from about 1985 through the present.\n* '''Wilmot Woods''': residential community of approximately 150 Colonial-style homes built in 1937 by the firm Haring & Blumethal. It is modeled on the plan of the old New England villages, with a four-acre 'village green' located at the center of the tract.

Wykagyl consists of sprawling, residential neighborhoods and natural green-space. Wykagyl is frequently used in reference to the small business district of retail stores, restaurants, offices and condominium developments located at the center of the community which serves as the \"Downtown\" for many Northenders. The construction of the New York-Westchester-Boston Railroad line through the sparsely populated north end of New Rochelle in 1912 and its creation of a Wykagyl stop and Station gave rise to an entirely new residential and business section of the city. To take advantage of the expanded commuting opportunities, \"Wykagyl Gardens\", one of the largest apartment complexes in the country at the time, was  built adjacent to the station. The area's unusual name most likely resulted from the shortening of the name of an Algonquin tribe of Native Americans who originally inhabited the area.\n* '''Wykagyl Crossways''': early to 20th century residential park characterized by average size Tudor, Mediterranean and colonial homes on small lots\n* '''Wykagyl Estates''': newer residential development located just north of Wykagyl Country Club. The area consists of late 20th century ranch homes as well as contemporary 1990s structures, and was built as a \"tennis community\" centered on community courts and facilities.\n* '''Wykagyl Park''': early 20th century residential park developed by the Trenor Land Company.

[[Irapuato]], [[Guanajuato]], January 21, 1905 - d. [[Mexico City]], June 11, 1987) was a Mexican architect, one of the leading exponents of modern Mexican architecture and one of the most prominent of a generation of architects of the so-called [[functionalism]] movement, a group that included artists and architects such as [[Jose Villagran]], [[Carlos Obregon Santacilia]], [[Juan O'Gorman]], Juan Legarreta, Carlos Tarditti, Enrique de la Mora and Enrique Yanez. The movement  developed from innovative concepts presented by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Le Corbusier]], [[Mies van der Rohe]] and the [[Bauhaus]] school as well as [[Die Stijl]], and remodeled the profile of cosmopolitan Mexico City and other cities predominantly in the 1930\u2018s.\n\nDuring his career, Enrique de Moral was designer and builder of over 100 public and private works of every kind, conducted in more than 50 years of professional activity: hospitals, clinics, universities and schools, airports, subway stations, hotels, office buildings and apartments, housing complexes, houses for workers and employees, magna residences, sports fields and arenas. He is known for his leading role in the overall plan of the [[City University]] (1947-1952), site of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM), where along with the architects [[Mario Pani]] and [[Salvador Ortega]], he was responsible for the direction and coordination of the master project and the Rectory Tower, no doubt one of the most representative features of the campus.\n\nHe was also a remarkable academic and theoretician, and was director of the [[Faculty of Architecture (UNAM)]] (1944-1949), where he modernized curricula, incorporating the best practices of North American universities, the humanities, and his professional life. He was a pupil of Dr. Jose Gaos in the [[Faculty of Philosophy and Literature (UNAM)]] and attended the Seminary of Culture in Mexico, sharing classes with eminent thinkers such as [[Edmundo O'Gorman]], Justin Fernandez and [[Leopoldo Zea]].\n\nA frequent lecturer, Enrique del Moral appeared at national and international forums and published books and essays in which he analyzed the evolution of architectural styles, and largely reflected on the cutting edge, recognizing those who introduced a new esthetic in the art of building: [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] - and with the latter he maintained a close friendship. He theorized about [[functionalism]] in Mexico and debated controversial issues of his time, such as the integration of [[plastic arts]] into architecture, and promoted the conservation of cities, with a unique approach to harmony between tradition and modernity.\n\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early Life===\n\nEnrique del Moral Dom\u00ednguez was born on January 21, 1905 in [[Irapuato]], [[Guanajuato]], the only son of Henry del Moral and Maria de los Angeles Dominguez. He spent his formative years in Mexico City, given the family's decision to move to the country's capital in 1909. He attended elementary, middle and high school at the Institut Franco-English, where he met Juan O'Gorman, who later also will follow the former to the [[Academy of San Carlos]] to study architecture.\n\nWith Mexico in the midst of revolutionary struggle, del Moral crossed the country with his mother to visit his mother's family in [[El Paso, Texas]], where they took refuge. The trip to the United States gave him the nickname \"El Gringo\" and, more significantly, gave him the vision of a devastated and impoverished Mexico that was at the same time immensely rich in landscape, materials and elements.\n\n===Years of Training===\n\nAt 18 years of age, Enrique del Moral met architect [[Jose Villagran Garcia]] when he was a student and a colleague of Del Moral\u2019s cousin, Eduardo Jim\u00e9nez del Moral, and soon became interested in the architectural profession. In 1923 he entered the [[Faculty of Architecture (UNAM)]], which then had a staff of only 36 students and was housed in the old [[Academy of San Carlos]].\n\nIn the year 1924, del Moral was invited to enter into a draftsmanship with Villagran and [[Carlos Obregon Santacilia]], the two most innovative architects in the country. With the latter, he participated in building projects for the [[Bank of Mexico]] (1925) and the Ministry of Health (1928), works with a clearly modern sensibility.\n\nDel Moral became one of the first students of Villagran invited to teach a free workshop on composition. Shortly after 1926, and under the guidance of his mentor, he and his generation began study of a new architectural theory:  [[functionalism]]. Functionalism emphasized the idea that every work comes from \u201ca method that is determined by thoroughly analyzing and correctly interpreting a solution to guarantee success\" .[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Enrique_del_Moral#References\/] These new values \u200b\u200bwere extolled in the theories of \"utility\", \"constructive sincerity, \"\"esthetics or harmony\" and \"social or moral value.\" All this meant a definitive break with the traditional architecture of academicism which was limited by its tendency to outright copy the [[French Colonial| French]] or [[Spanish Colonial| Spanish]] colonial styles, with facades adorned with [[Greco-Roman]], [[Neoclassical Architecture| Neoclassical]] [[moulding]]. \n\nOn November 29, 1928 he was received as an architect and months later, after winning the lottery by a stroke of luck, he undertook a trip to Europe for a full year in order to understand the architectural expressions of [[England]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]], [[Germany]], and also [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]. Like Le Corbusier, who studied with pencil in hand the styles of the classics of European architecture, Del Moral also created a series of drawings and watercolors of houses and buildings with an extraordinary quality.\n\nUpon his return, he continued working in the studio of Obreg\u00f3n Santacilia, where he rose to a resident of work, then to foreman and finally became a partner (1933-35). At this time he participated in projects such as the [[Monument to the Revolution]], Reform Hotel and Hotel Prado with the architect Marcial Gutierrez Camarena, and the house of [[Manuel Gomez Morin]] (1930) with [[Juan O'Gorman]].\n\n===First Works and Teaching===\n\nDuring the thirties, Enrique del Moral started its first projects as an independent architect and simultaneously began his long and distinguished teaching career at the [[Faculty of Architecture (UNAM)]]. From 1934 on he taught the subject of [[Draftsmanship]] and also Composition, which was a beginning course until 1950.\n\nIn 1936 he set up his private office, associated with the architect Marcial Guti\u00e9rrez Camarena. His first project was to build ten houses for workers in his hometown of Irapuato, a project with a strong social context, created jointly from surveys conducted with the workers\u2019 own families and adapted to the economic conditions of the inhabitants as well as the environment, factoring in the climate and landscape of the location.\n\nThis professional period coincided with a new stage in his life: on November 30, 1940 Del Moral married Elisa Madrid Moreno.\n\nThese were years in which he worked, usually in private projects such as residential houses and apartment buildings in zoned residential areas of Mexico City. However, there were contemporary public works projects representative of his particular style; austere solutions that favored the use of local materials and avoiding waste: the General Hospital of San Luis Potosi (1943) and the School of Casacuar\u00e1n, Guanajuato ( 1946), were built by Del Moral along with many other schools in the state, during his period as Area Manager of the Administrative Committee of the Federal Program for School Construction (1944-46).\n\n===Maturation of Style===\n\nHis spirit of curiosity about Mexican past and the present of the architecture developed in the country prompted him to enroll in the Seminar on the History of Ideas and Culture in the Eighteenth Century, taught by Dr. Jose Gaos in the Faculty of Philosophy and Literature of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico ([[UNAM]]). From 1943 to 1946, the two men shared ideas and friendship with other intellectuals interested in discovering the essence of the Mexican culture in philosophy, science and art: [[Edmundo O'Gorman]], [[Leopoldo Zea]], Bernabe Navarro and Justin Fernandez, among others.\n\nThe experience paid off. In 1945 he wrote <nowiki> \"The Baroque Stylistic Phenomenon,\" <\/nowiki> the first in a series of essays and articles that developed over four decades and which addressed a wide range of topics on history, theory, commitment, and modern architecture. Some of them are fundamental to understanding firsthand the [[avant-garde]] architectural movement in the Twentieth Century and their authors ([[Le Corbusier]], [[Gropius]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Mies van der Rohe]], the [[Bauhaus]], [[De Stijl]]), as well as the details of [[functionalism]] in Mexico. [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Enrique_del_Moral#References\/]\n\nIn 1944 he was appointed director of the National School of Architecture, a position he held for five years. With the arrival of Dr. Salvador Zubir\u00e1n to the rectory of the UNAM (1946-48), he received approval to raise the academic level of the race. In 1947 he traveled with the rector to the United States to visit various schools and talk to architects about educational systems. While at Harvard he met [[Walter Gropius]], founder of the Bauhaus, and at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]], he formed a friendship with [[Mies Van der Rohe]] (c. 1948), who provided ideas that served as the basis for a new curriculum.\n\nAs race director, Del Moral was made the head of the greatest work of contemporary Mexican architecture: [[City University]] (1947-1954). It was a work that required enormous effort to coordinate.  For the first time in the country, more than 70 architects, interns, drafters, engineers and technicians were tasked with the construction of buildings, facilities and services. With [[Mario Pani]], Del Moral developed the master plan based on the draft of the students Teodoro Gonz\u00e1lez de Le\u00f3n, Enrique Molinar and Armando Franco. Del Moral and Pani were designated joint directors of the architectural project. Together they carried out for the building of the Torre de Rectoria (1950), with Salvador Ortega Flores, and the sports fields and entrances. [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Enrique_del_Moral#References\/]\n\nDel Moral\u2019s association with Pani began shortly before the contest for the project of building the Mexican Insurance (1946), later adapted for the Ministry of Water Resources, where their entries tied for first place. It was the first time they worked together and they continued to do so for seven years, a period in which a total of 22 works, most of them in [[Acapulco]] (the first airport, a fishing club and many hotels and houses), which had then begun its rise as a tourist center.\n\nIn 1948, Del Moral made perhaps his most emblematic example of functionalism with uniquely local features; Mexican, but at the same time, international: The family home in [[Tacubaya]], Mexico City, next door to [[Luis Barragan]].\n\n===Years of Expertise===\n\nFrom the fifties on, Del Moral encountered a stage of professional projects that demanded more rigorous technical knowledge, and more specialized knowledge with attention to social programs. One of them was the market of [[La Merced Market| La Merced]] (1956), which supplanted thousands of makeshift and unsanitary stalls with spacious, well ventilated halls, an area to suit 550 stalls and 400 truck parking spaces, with amenities that included restrooms, an auditorium and eight child care centers.[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Enrique_del_Moral#References\/]\n\nThe buildings of the Attorney General of the Federal District (1958) and Criminal Courts of Lecumberri, in association with the architect Hilario Galguera (1961) involved a solution with maximum efficiency for the movement of lawyers and inmates, as well as for the proper performance of legal work.\n\nDel Moral deserves special mention for specialty and research hospitals built with funding and representation provided by the Ministry of Health in 1955. Del Moral designed and built in association with the architect Manuel Ech\u00e1varri a total of thirteen hospitals (five more were planned); five for the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) and the Institute of Security and Social Services for State Workers (ISSSTE), each in different states of the country: [[Federal District]], [[Tabasco]], [[Nuevo Leon]], [[Tamaulipas]], [[Sonora]] and [[Morelos]]. Of these the Gynecology Hospital (1969),  won him the prize for best work in [[Monterrey]] in design and production.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that during these years, Del Moral did not abandon teaching and trips to study abroad to see recent work or give lectures at conferences. From 1959 to 1963 he was professor of Mexican Architectural History at the Universidad Iberoamericana, and in the period from 1955 to 1978, he visited countries in Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nHe died on June 11, 1987, at age 82 in Mexico City due to a stomach malady that was complicated by heart disease. His remains were cremated in [[Civil Pantheon of Dolores]].\n\n==Works and Projects==\n\n'''1936 - 1939'''\n*Houses for workers (Irapuato, Guanajuato).

In the chair of composition at the School of Architecture, I had the opportunity to be [a] student directly, although each teacher had a limited number of learners and when Del Moral was quoted, I did not come on time their group, but always attended as a listener to the correction process with my peers. All [of the] comments were a lesson in the respect and application of the theoretical principles of Del Moral and Villagran Garcia. They never had a direct line on the bill that was presented, never stated or suggested a specific solution, always questioned at the approach, the reason for a solution, had comments and reflections; that is to say they taught to think without ever trying to impose solution criteria, which contrasted sharply with the position of other teachers about student work. They drew out a personal solution, thus making the student an artist of their own criteria. \n\nLater, I had the opportunity to work in his private office, precisely at the stage that developed the Hospital of San Luis Potosi and the numerous private residences and apartment buildings, and lived closely by during the development working with my colleagues: Miguel Pav\u00f3n Rivero served as Head of Workshop, Horacio Boy, Alfonso Gardu\u00f1o, Enrique Vergara, Jos\u00e9 Luis Certucha and more. I especially resolved administrative and technical aspects of the work with Mr. Elias Macotela Garcia, the engineer who was managing the office.l  During this period, I derived experiences that have been invaluable in my practice.\n\nThroughout his lectures, his frequent articles, we have all come to appreciate the breadth of his acculturation and his interest in our roots.\u201d <\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n'''Architect Agust\u00edn Hern\u00e1ndez Navarro'''\n\n<blockquote> \u201cIt was a great satisfaction to have frequently dealt with the architect Enrique del Moral, \u2018The American\u2019 as he was called; then I came to having such confidence in our dealings also called him, \u2018My General\u2019, since he bore a certain resemblance to my general uncles also.\n\nThe conversations he had with Mario Pani, who always accompanied them, were most inspirational. They were two very different personalities, but had a great affinity for one another.\n\nI remember being invited to parties often offered in their beautiful home, where they attended very interesting personalities.\n\nThe last time I saw him I was receiving care at the Hospital Nutrition and I suggested that he go on to plan for the United States, to which he replied that he would not for his love of our country.\n\nThere is an anecdote about him that I know directly from a cousin, also an architect, an Alfonso Gardu\u00f1o Navarro, who worked in his studio. At the time of project, held a monologue as: \u2018I am window\u2019, \u2018am a wall,\u2019 etc., and he spoke with great concentration while doing some design, which surprised those around him. I remember that with great fondness and admiration.\u201d <\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n'''Architect Manuel Echavarri and Olvera'''\n\n<blockquote> \u201cThe architect Enrique del Moral is one of the great masters and visionaries of modern architecture in Mexico. Generally treated as \u2018El Maestro\u2019, and who taught it in classrooms and workshops of the National School of Architecture, from 1934 to 1949 (only 15 years).\n\nThe Del Moral method of teaching was the workshop and the classroom, in his works, in traveling with him or at any meeting where he was with one or more architects and people interested in architecture and in every manifestation of art or culture in general ... The meetings at his home in Tacubaya made history.\n\nI was proud to work with him for 25 years \u2018shoulder to shoulder\u2019 on the drawing board, as a draftsman, foreman, supervisor of work, collaborator and eventually, partner.\n\nIn the dedication of a book that submitted to me by the architect Hilario Galguera (another of his colleagues), I wrote: \u2018For those extraordinary days working in the workshop of the Gringo.\u2019\n\nAnd in another book from the master himself Del Moral, which I keep with great affection, it reads: \u2018For the architect Manuel Ech\u00e1varri, testifying to the long years of collaboration and with very sincere esteem and friendship: Architect Enrique del Moral .\u2019\u201d <\/blockquote>\n\n==Gallery==\n\n<gallery>\nFile:CU-Mexico-rectoria-2.jpg| UNAM Rectory Tower\nFile:Enrique del Moral PNCA.JPG| [[National Prize for Arts and Sciences (Mexico)]] '78\nFile:Enrique del Moral Lopez Portillo.JPG| [[National Prize for Arts and Sciences (Mexico)]] shaking hands with [[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo]], Mexico City.\nFile:Enrique del Moral Honoris Causa.JPG| Honorary doctorate [[UNAM]], 1985.\n<\/gallery>\n\n==References==\n\n*. \u2191 National Council for Culture and the Arts. \"National Prize of Sciences and Arts.\" Ministry of Education.

PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE EPISODE NUMBERS IN THIS ARTICLE. -->\n\"'''Search Committee'''\" is the hour-long finale of the [[The Office (U.S. season 7)|seventh season]] of the American television comedy series ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]''. It comprises the 151st and 152nd episodes of the series overall and the 25th and 26th episodes of the seventh season. It originally aired on [[NBC]] on May&nbsp;19,&nbsp;2011 in the United States.  In the episode, [[Deangelo Vickers|Deangelo]]'s new replacement is sought out through a search committee process led by [[Jim Halpert|Jim]] ([[John Krasinski]]). Meanwhile, [[Angela Martin|Angela]] becomes engaged to her state senator boyfriend, Robert ([[Jack Coleman (actor)|Jack Coleman]]), while the rest of the office believes he is gay.\n\nThe episode was written by show runner and executive producer [[Paul Lieberstein]] and was directed by [[Jeffrey Blitz]]. The episode featured several guest appearances including one from ''The Office'' co-creator [[Ricky Gervais]], his second appearance on the series.<ref name=\"ep26\">{{Cite web|url=http:\/\/www.officetally.com\/the-office-search-committee|title=The Office: Search Committee, 7.25-7.26|work=OfficeTally|accessdate=April 30, 2011}}<\/ref> The episode also marks the first appearance of [[James Spader]] and [[Catherine Tate]], the former of whom was a series regular in the eighth season while the latter had a recurring appearance in the eighth season and was a series regular in the ninth and final season.\n\n\"Search Committee\" received mixed reviews from critics with multiple critics commenting on the multiple guest stars. According to [[Nielsen Media Research]], \"Search Committee\" was viewed by an estimated 7.29&nbsp;million viewers and earned a 3.9 rating\/10% share in the 18\u201349 demographic, marking a rise in the ratings from the previous episode and the previous season finale.\n\n==Synopsis==\nWith [[Deangelo Vickers]] still in a coma, Dunder Mifflin\u2013Sabre Scranton is left with [[Creed Bratton (character)|Creed]] ([[Creed Bratton]]) as interim regional manager. [[Jo Bennett]] ([[Kathy Bates]]) puts [[Jim Halpert|Jim]] ([[John Krasinski]]), [[Toby Flenderson|Toby]] ([[Paul Lieberstein]]) and [[Gabe Lewis|Gabe]] ([[Zach Woods]]) into a committee to interview candidates for the manager position, including [[Andy Bernard|Andy]] ([[Ed Helms]]), [[Darryl Philbin|Darryl]] ([[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]]) and a number of outsiders, including a personal friend of hers, Nellie Bertram ([[Catherine Tate]]), who suggests various strange methods for running an office, including a \"zen garden\" theme and removal of all official titles for Dunder Mifflin Scranton. [[Pam Halpert|Pam]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) takes it upon herself to protect the office and their clients from Creed's haphazard and potentially catastrophic managerial style (he keeps trying to call major clients and tell them the office is about to go out of business) by distracting him with activities and posing as various clients when Creed has [[Jordan Garfield|Jordan]] ([[Cody Horn]]) contact them. \n\n[[Dwight Schrute|Dwight]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]), still upset over being demoted by Jo, stops taking care of himself and openly looks through want ads in the office. His attitude changes when he speaks with applicant [[Robert California]] ([[James Spader]]), who disparages the position and the office. Merv ruins his interview, and Dwight becomes incensed that the position might go to someone who doesn't take it seriously. He demands to be interviewed, and while Jim balks, after Dwight's persistent efforts to acquire an interview, Jo instructs Jim to grant him one, as she likes \"a little bit of crazy.\" Jim had earlier firmly shot down Dwight's extensive bribe list for Jim's support, and quickly ends his formal interview.\n\nDarryl thinks his popularity with the staff will make him a shoo-in, so he thinks he doesn't have to do an interview like everyone else. He is caught off-guard when he actually must do an interview and they ask for his resume. Darryl writes up an overly extensive four-page resume, which Jo quickly derides, though Jim encourages Darryl by saying that the interview and resume are mere formalities for him. When Andy interviews for the manager position, Gabe hijacks the meeting in an attempt to sabotage him by asking random trivia questions, which Andy successfully parries, but Gabe ends up screaming at him and acting like a lunatic. Gabe is also dismissive of [[Kelly Kapoor|Kelly]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]) during her interview, saying she's not a \"real candidate\". Kelly exacts revenge by telling Jo about Gabe's relationship with [[Erin Hannon|Erin]] ([[Ellie Kemper]]) and his harassing behavior after their breakup. In response, Jo sends Gabe back to Sabre's Florida headquarters, and installs Kelly in Gabe's position on the search committee. Kelly then says she has accepted Dwight's bribery and looks forward to the benefits of his return to the manager's chair, as Toby haltingly says they could give Dwight another trial run and Jim looks on in horror. After Phyllis tells Jim that Kelly and Dwight have pre-fired her, Jim tells Dwight he is not and will not be the manager, and the office begins arguing about who will be selected. When the discussion gets out of control, with [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan]] ([[B.J. Novak]]) preferring a homeless man, Andy declaring he wants the job, and Darryl's daughter Jada asking out loud if Jim is the guy making him manager, Jim cuts it short and brings the committee back to the conference room to make up their minds.\n\n[[Phyllis Lapin-Vance|Phyllis]] ([[Phyllis Smith]]) and Erin await the results of a DNA test to see if Erin is the daughter previously given up by Phyllis in high school. The results are negative, but Phyllis holds off on telling Erin after Andy rejects Erin's proposal to start dating again, and continues to show maternal affection toward her.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Angela Martin|Angela]] ([[Angela Kinsey]]) becomes engaged to her state senator boyfriend, Robert. [[Oscar Martinez (The Office)|Oscar]] ([[Oscar Nunez]]), who strongly believes that Robert is gay, shares his feelings with Pam. Ryan overhears them and confirms that Robert is gay, in his opinion. When the rest of the office thinks so as well, they must decide whether or not to tell Angela. They eventually decide not to tell Angela for a wide range of reasons\u2014not everyone is sure Robert is gay, Oscar is looking forward to the elegant wedding, and Pam doesn't think it's anyone's right to blurt out that information. Angela is then typically rude about her nuptial plans\u2014first sing-songing to an indifferent Stanley that they might not have room to invite him to the wedding, and then asking Pam if she can borrow the plans for the dream wedding Pam never got to have, before mocking the ceremony where Pam and Jim got married at Niagara Falls. Pam is sorely tempted to spill the beans about Robert's sexuality, but ends up smiling sweetly and wishing Angela \"a very happy wedding\".\n\n==Production==\n[[Image:JonathanRossRickyGervais cropped.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|''[[The Office]]'' co-creator [[Ricky Gervais]] guest starred and contributed to the script for \"Search Committee\"]] \n\"Search Committee\" was written by show runner and executive producer [[Paul Lieberstein]], who also plays [[Toby Flenderson]] on the show, his 14th writing credit of the series.

The CSE has created a platform to convene the many disciplinary facets of the IIT colleges with business, community and government stakeholders in focused initiatives dedicated to making Chicago a [[sustainable city]]. \n\n==History==\nThe CSE was founded in 2000 and operates with funding on a project-by-project basis.  The center has also hosted numerous seminars on environmental and sustainability issues, as well as several national and international conferences. \nProjects conducted by the CSE have included a form of life cycle analysis for a small Chicago company manufacturing floor maintenance products, a [[geographic information system]] (GIS) research project for two subsidiaries of [[Exelon]], and a [[life cycle assessment]] (LCA) on a new product for [[S. C. Johnson]]. \n\nIn 2006, the Center for Sustainable Enterprise became a founding member of the [[Foresight Design Initiative|Chicago Sustainable Business Alliance]] (CSBA), a 150-member organization dedicated to sustainability and sustainable networking in the city of Chicago.\n\n==Mission==\nThe primary mission of the CSE is the identification, development, communication and implementation of practical and equitable business strategies that advance the ecological sustainability of the [[Chicago Metropolitan Area|greater Chicago area]]. \nBy expanding on traditional business and enterprise models, the center has developed strategies that look beyond conventional metrics and engage the entire business in valuing and enhancing the capital of its enterprise.\nThe CSE developed a tool called \u2018\u2019total asset management\u2019\u2019 which analyses financial, physical, human and natural forms of capital. By incorporating this concept, businesses can assess and align the capital that they directly affect or influence and create a path forward into a more sustainable future. Envisioning new paradigms that appreciate all these forms of capital creates added value for the company. \nAnother tool created by the CSE, \u2018\u2019the comprehensive enterprise models\u2019\u2019 helps businesses and communities, represented by both and government and [[Non-governmental organizations|non-government organizations]], rethink their relationships and construct a more balanced and sustainable paradigm.\n\n==Principal activities==\nWhile specific projects depend on the interests of participants, the community and funding support, the CSE performs the following activities:\n\n* Common Ground: The CSE serves as a forum where groups can collaborate to remove barriers to achieving ecological and economic sustainability while learning, teaching and sharing the elements of sustainable enterprise.\n* Executive Education: Educate, sensitize and empower key corporate executives\/managers and small\/medium business owners with practical and equitable business strategies that foster ecological and economic sustainability.\n* Educational Support: Provide sustainable enterprise instruction, curricula and internship projects to university-based programs and community colleges within the Greater Chicago Area.\n* Commercial Applications of Research: provide the platform for quick and efficient transfers of university-based research and proven industry-based applications to companies, especially small and medium enterprises.\n* Focused Business Support: Work with existing businesses and organizations to develop the tools for success in an emerging, sustainable economy.\n* New Business Development: Incubate start-up companies that promote sustainable environmental technologies and practices.\n* Research: Gather data on current use of elements of sustainability and develop reliable metrics and feedback loops that demonstrate the benefits related to the use of sustainable strategies.\n* Information Sharing: Expand the benefits of the learning and teaching efforts of the center by sharing the systems, methods, and technologies developed through the center with other organizations and businesses, locally and nationally.\n\n==Initiatives==\nAs part of its purpose of expanding on traditional business and enterprise models, the center has participated in several projects and initiatives with small companies, local government, and other corporations. \n\n===Continuing Educational Programs===\nAs part of its educational outreach program, the center offers seminars for universities and colleges focusing on curriculum development and collaboration for small to medium enterprises with a focus on team development, and for large corporations with a focus on functional area leaders. \n\n===Wind Turbine===\nIn 2003 the center installed a highly efficient small wind turbine on a temporary basis in front of the [[Field Museum of Natural History]], located in Chicago, to validate wind tunnel performance data.  The turbine will demonstrate how it can provide a supplemental-energy system for the metropolitan areas. \n\n===Remote Hybrid Unit===\nThe CSE is collaborating with a local Chicago company to introduce to the Midwest a unique lighting and security system operating on wind and solar energy \u2013 completely off the grid.  This remote hybrid unit is an 18 foot light post with a security camera option.\n\n===Implementing Educational Programs===\nThe CSE is working with the [[National Technical University of Athens]] to introduce a Master of Science in Sustainability for the Greek, balkan and middle-east markets.\n\n===Urban Timber===\nUrban timber represents an alternative paradigm to current forestry and landscape practices. The CSE has proposed a plan to the city of Chicago, Department of the Environment promoting the development of an urban timber selection, management and harvesting scheme that provides multiple benefits to the community, the environment, the economy, and the managing enterprise through the entire lifecycle of the trees.\n\n===Next Generation CO<sub>2<\/sub>  Emission Reduction Metrics===\nThe CSE provides an evaluation of the [[footprint]] of a product and the [[carbon dioxide]] and CO<sub>2<\/sub> equivalents related to its manufacture, use and final disposition.\n\n===Chicago Sustainable Business Alliance===\nAs a founding member of a 150-member organization dedicated to sustainability, the CSE hosts monthly networking meetings and seminars.\n\n==References==\n* http:\/\/csba.foresightdesign.org\/\/featured\/cse\/index.php\n* http:\/\/csba.foresightdesign.org\/members\/member_detail.php?mid=31\n* http:\/\/www.is4ie.org\/images\/Nassos_and_Kusz.pdf\n* http:\/\/www.lmawma.org\/index_files\/newsletter2003Q2WindTurbine.pdf\n\n==External links==\n* [http:\/\/www.stuart.iit.edu\/ Stuart School of Business]\n* [http:\/\/www.stuart.iit.edu\/graduateprograms\/ms\/environmentalmanagement\/ MS in Environmental Management and Sustainability]\n* [http:\/\/www.iit.edu\/ Illinois Institute of Technology]\n* [http:\/\/www.sustainabiliity.com\/ Sustainable Enterprise: Strategies for the 21st Century and beyond]\n* [http:\/\/csba.foresightdesign.org\/ Chicago Sustainable Business Alliance]\n\n{{Illinois Institute of Technology}}\n\n[[Category:Illinois Institute of Technology]]\n[[Category:Sustainability organisations]]","timestamp":"20160410100625","user-timestamp":"20150410100625"},{"title":"Talk:Spencer's (department store)","content":"{{WPCANADA|bc=yes|class=Start|importance=Low|Vancouver=yes|Vancouver-importance=low}}\n{{WikiProject Shopping Centers|class=Start|importance=Low}}","timestamp":"20160410100625","user-timestamp":"20150410100625"},{"title":"Talk:Association of Space Explorers","content":"{{WikiProjectBannerShell|1=\n{{WikiProject Spaceflight|class=start|importance=low}}\n{{WikiProject Russia|class=Start|importance=low|tech=yes|hist=yes}}\n{{WikiProject Organizations}}\n}}\n\n== 1983 ==\nIn the foreword of my book ''Der Heimatplanet'' it is written that ASE was formed in the year 1983, not 1985, in Putschino nearby [[Moscow]].

The East region was formed by the states of Bahia, Minas Gerais, Esp\u00edrito Santo, Rio de Janeiro and the former Federal District which was the now-days city of Rio de Janeiro (when the capital of Brazil was transfered to Brasilia DF, this former Federal District turned into the state of Guanabara, which lasted only 15 years before being absorbed by the state of Rio de Janeiro).  One day, in the 1950's, the state of Bahia was moved from the East region to the Northeast Region, while Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, Rio de Janeiro and the former FD joined with the state of S\u00e3o Paulo to create the Southeast region.  S\u00e3o Paulo was formerly part of the South region.\n\n:Also, the Centre-West region has lost territory to the North region.  Tocantins and Rondonia were formerly parts of Goias and Mato Grosso, respectivelly, before being emancipated.  In spite of Goias and Mato Grosso are part of the Centre-West region, Tocantins and Rondonia were added to the North region when they were created -instead of the Centre-West.

Located on the border with The Natural Park of Maremma, not far from the mouth of the river [[Ombrone]], Marina di Grosseto has grown substantially since the beginning of urbanization in the 20th century, notably after the draining of the marshes of the [[Maremma]] district in the 1930s.\n\n== Main sights ==\n*''Castle of San Rocco''\n*''Church of San Rocco''\n*''Colonia marina Giuseppina Saragat''\n\n==See also==\n*[[Grosseto]]\n*[[Maremma]]\n*[[Alberese]]\n*[[Batignano]]\n*[[Braccagni]]\n*[[Istia d'Ombrone]]\n*[[Montepescali]]\n*[[Principina a Mare]]\n*[[Principina Terra]]\n*[[Rispescia]]\n*[[Rusellae|Roselle]]\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat-inline|Marina di Grosseto}}\n* [http:\/\/www.turismo.intoscana.it\/intoscana2\/export\/TurismoRTen\/sito-TurismoRTen\/Contenuti\/Natura\/Spiagge\/visualizza_asset.html_892828809.html Tourism in Southern Maremma]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Marina Di Grosseto}}\n[[Category:Frazioni of the Province of Grosseto]]\n[[Category:Grosseto]]\n[[Category:Coastal towns in Tuscany]]","timestamp":"20160410100635","user-timestamp":"20150410100635"},{"title":"Category:Korean War cathead templates","content":"{{template category}}\n[[Category:Military cathead templates]]","timestamp":"20160410100635","user-timestamp":"20150410100635"},{"title":"Yenmanagandla","content":"{{Refimprove|date=February 2015}}\n\n{{Infobox settlement\n<!-- See Template:Infobox settlement for additional fields and descriptions -->\n| name                    = Yenmanagandla\n| native_name             = \n| native_name_lang        = \n| settlement_type         = Village\n| image_skyline           = \n| image_alt               = \n| image_caption           = \n| pushpin_map             = India Telangana\n| pushpin_label_position  = right\n| pushpin_map_alt         = \n| pushpin_map_caption     = Location in Telangana\n\n| longd = 78 | longm = 01 | longs = 53 | longEW = E\n| coor_pinpoint           = \n| coordinates_type        = region:IN-TG_type:city\n| coordinates_display     = inline,title\n| subdivision_type        = Country\n| subdivision_name        = [[India]]\n| subdivision_type1       = [[States and territories of India|State]]\n| subdivision_name1       = [[Telangana]]\n| subdivision_type2       = [[Districts of India|District]]\n| subdivision_name2       = [[Mahbubnagar district|Mahbubnagar]]\n| subdivision_type3       = [[Tehsil|Subdistrict]]\n| subdivision_name3       = [[Nawabpet, Mahbubnagar district|Nawabpet]]\n| elevation_footnotes     = \n| elevation_m             = 541\n| population_footnotes    = \n| population_total        = \n| population_as_of        = \n| demographics_type1      = Languages\n| demographics1_title1    = Official\n| demographics1_info1     = Telugu and Hindi, Urdu\n| time zone 1               = [[Indian Standard Time|IST]]\n| utc_offset1             = +05:30\n| postal_code_type        = [[Postal Index Number|Pincode]]\n| postal_code             =\n| area_code_type          = Telephone code\n| area_code               = 08542\n| registration_plate      = \n| blank1_name_sec1        = \n| blank1_info_sec1        = \n| footnotes               = \n}}\n'''Yenmanagandla''' is a village and [[Gram panchayat]] in [[Nawabpet, Mahbubnagar district|Nawabpet]] Mandal in [[Mahbubnagar District]] of the Indian state of [[Telangana]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http:\/\/www.onefivenine.com\/india\/villages\/Mahbubnagar\/Nawabpet\/Yenmanagandla |title=Yenmanagandla Village |publisher=OneFiveNine.com |accessdate=1 February 2015}}<\/ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http:\/\/panchayatdirectory.gov.in\/adminreps\/viewGPmapcvills.asp?gpcode=208603&rlbtype=V |title=List of Census Villages mapped for :YENMANAGANDLA Gram Panchayat,NAWABPET,MAHBUBNAGAR,Telangana |publisher=Ministry of Panchayati Raj |accessdate=1 February 2015}}<\/ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n\nThe population is 6,917 people\n\nThe local population mostly speaks [[Telugu language|Telugu]] (the third most spoken language in India excluding English) and [[Urdu language|Urdu]] (the 2nd most spoken language in Telangana state), .<ref>http:\/\/soki.in\/yenmanagandla-nawabpet-mahbubnagar\/<\/ref>\n\n== Location ==\n\nThe total area of Yenmanagandla is 2819 hectares.

Like the Biblical [[Apocalypse]], the poem is addressed to the \"Seven Churches\", but manuscripts differ as to whether they are the \"Seven Churches in England\" or \"Seven Churches in [[Neustria]]\".\n\nThe ''Apocalypse of Golias'' has been ascribed by different scholars to [[Alan of Lille]], [[Walter of Ch\u00e2tillon]], [[Hugh Primas]] and [[Walter Map]], but the evidence is against these attributions. The poem is one of a group of about the same date, all connected with the fictional \"Bishop Golias\", but these poems are not all by the same author.\n\nThe poet narrates a vision, a summer dream, in which [[Pythagoras]] offers to act as his guide, and gives him a quick view of the scholars and writers of the classical world from [[Priscian]] to [[Hippocrates]]. An angel then appears to introduce the main theme, a fierce criticism of pope, bishops, priests, archdeacons and deacons, who are successively likened to different animals.

Why on Earth would you say it's \"most likely\" that they're bisexual?   There's zero evidence for that.  These rumours only ever come from distant fans with no connection to the band.  It's pure nonsense, and I say that because the tabloids, who have shown no restraint in publishing false stories about Peter, would have proved it if there were even a kernel of truth. It would have been a major front-page story in the Moss era, and Peter is pretty much incapable of hiding anything.  No homosexual encounter with him could have stayed hidden with tabloid cash on offer and the media feeding-frenzy around him for so long.  \n\n:I honestly think this is just [[psychological projection]] from his legions of male fans, struggling to understand the [[The closet|confusing feelings]] they get from reading, [http:\/\/www.dirtyprettythingsband.com\/index.php\/forums\/viewthread\/3599\/ on the forums ], the lustful adoration of female fans for the band.

[[User:Robdurbar|Robdurbar]] 16:58, 23 April 2006 (UTC)\n\nIf a source is needed, IMDB confirms his birthname as Carl, listing Carlos as his nickname.  It also includes a circumflex.

That was quite rash, wasn't it. I'm 90% sure that his name is spelled without a circumflex. If you have a look at the cover of Bound Together, it says Carl Bar'''a'''t.

Is it because he used it on his book and album?

The pyramid is approximately 15 metres in height and built from  blocks of the local  granite. Not to be confused with the nearby natural rock formations known as the Pyramids in the [[Girraween National Park]]. It is on private property belonging to a local vineyard (Henty Estate) and is approximately 25 metres from the nearest road.<ref>http:\/\/maps.google.com.au\/maps?q=-28.814822,151.851225&num=1&t=h&sll=-28.814709,151.848092&sspn=0.016131,0.038409&ie=UTF8&ll=-28.813995,151.851225&spn=0.008066,0.019205&z=16<\/ref> It was built by a former land owner at a cost of one thousand Australian dollars. <ref>Houghton, Des \"Craig Gore's unwanted grape crop at Henty Estate vineyard\" March 13, 2009 [http:\/\/www.news.com.au\/couriermail\/story\/0,23739,25181741-5012449,00.html]<\/ref> The pyramid was built after a local resident, Peter Watters (Watters Vine Management Service), asked what was to be done with the surplus amount of granite rocks that were excavated for land tillage. The pyramid took eight months to build using an excavator and dump truck.<ref>\"Landmark Legends of Stanthorpe\"[http:\/\/www.granitebeltwinecountry.com.au\/pages\/landmark-legends-of-stanthorpe\/]<\/ref>\n\n==Construction==\nAfter a somewhat comical suggestion of a pyramid was put forth, construction began almost straight away. The pyramid base was to be 30 metres wide. Landscaping of the base was completed early and the rocks were collected by a dump truck and brought to the site. The first three levels of rocks were laid first by a large excavator and then manoeuvred appropriately into place by a smaller excavator. As the pyramid rose, a makeshift dirt ramp was built to negotiate the height and the construction vehicles used this access ramp to complete the pyramid. At the end of construction, the ramp was removed by the excavator.\n\n==Regulations and Maintenance==\nIt is currently forbidden for public to climb the pyramid for any reason. The pyramid is on private property where public entry is prohibited, but it is visible from the road.\n\nAs considerable amounts of earth from the construction ramp ended up inside the pyramid, weeds and [[blackberry]] bushes have appeared on the pyramid. A small tree even germinated at the very top of the pyramid which could be seen from a distance, causing annoyance to passers-by. This was removed by hand by a vineyard worker in mid-January 2013, restoring the pyramid to its original symmetrical look.\n\n==Services==\nAn [[ANZAC]] day service was held at the site and the [[Last Post]] was played from midway up the pyramid, and a flag was posted at the top.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Gympie Pyramid]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category-inline|Ballandean Pyramid}}\n\n[[Category:Ballandean, Queensland]]\n[[Category:Pyramids in Australia]]","timestamp":"20160410100703","user-timestamp":"20150410100703"},{"title":"User talk:WhiteLithium","content":"<!-- Template from Template:Welcomeg -->{| style=\"background-color:#F5FFFA; padding:0;\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|class=\"MainPageBG\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgrey; background-color:lightgrey; vertical-align:top; color:#000000; font-size:85%\"|\n{| width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"5\" style=\"vertical-align:top; background-color:lavender; padding:0;\"\n! <div style=\"margin:0; background-color:white; font-family:sans-serif; font-size:120%; font-weight:normal; border:1px solid lightgrey; text-align:left; padding-left:0.4em; padding-top:0.2em; padding-bottom:0.2em;\">Hello, '''WhiteLithium'''!

This novel was followed by a sequel, ''[[La Fin de Ch\u00e9ri]]'', published in 1926.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe novel is about the separation of Ch\u00e9ri and his lover of six years, the much older L\u00e9a de Lonval (as the novel opens he is 25 and she is 49. The beginning of their relationship, when he was 19 and she 43, is recounted in a long flashback).  The two believe their relationship is casual until they are separated by Ch\u00e9ri's marriage. It is only then they realize they have been in love. They spend a miserable six months apart, at which point Ch\u00e9ri appears at L\u00e9a's home. They spend the night together and L\u00e9a begins to plan their new life together. Having seen her in the morning light, Ch\u00e9ri notes how she has aged and realizes that the L\u00e9a he had longed for is gone.  He leaves for the last time.\n\n==Adaptations==\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Bissell and Samsova.jpg|thumb|150px|right| [[Patrick Bissell]] and [[Galina Samsova]] dancing the lead roles at the premiere of ''[[Ch\u00e9ri (novel)|Cheri]]'' at the 1980 [[Edinburgh Festival]].]] -->\nThe novel has been adapted to film twice, in 1950 and [[Cheri (2009 film)|2009]]; and television twice, in 1962 and 1973.\n\nThe ballet of ''Ch\u00e9ri'' premiered at the [[Edinburgh Festival]] in September 1980.

You are right that an outsider  wouldn't know this without being told or observant. This is not that unusual for place names in the united states. Try Newark NJ (something like \"Newirk\") Vs. Newark DE (new-Ark). I've heard differing stories on how to pronounce the Arkansas River. Which brings up the pronunciation difference between the states of Kansas (Can-sass) and Arkansas (Ar-can-saw). Or most places in the US with place names from England are pronounced completely differently than the original.

The Conference Committee works with the SES Board to develop the conference program, which covers a variety of topics related to standards and standardization.  The annual conference provides an excellent opportunity for standards professionals to network with their peers and to learn about issues of interest to them. Participants from around the world exchange ideas, discuss problems, and offer solutions.\n\nDuring the week of the annual conference, two courses are held on standardization issues. One course, \u201cA Guide to Standards,\u201d is based on an SES publication.  SES also works with other organizations to present an additional course which has in the past covered such topics as standardization principles and practices, strategies for success in standards, leadership training, and benefiting from the national and international standards development process\n\n==Certification Programs==\n\nSES operates a certification program to demonstrate professional competence in the standards field.  Certification can be obtained in the following areas:  standards information, \nstandards management, standards application, and standards development. The certification process includes the completion of an application to collect information on education and experience and a test based on several standards-related publications. There are two certification categories \u2013 Associate Standards Professional Certification (AStd.) and Standards Professional Certification (CStd.).  After completing the program, members are entitled to use one of these SES designations\n\n==Journal - Standards Engineering==\n\nStandards Engineering, the Society\u2019s bimonthly journal, provides up-to-date articles on standards-related issues authored by experts in the standards arena.

This event usually takes place in October in Washington, D.C.  During this celebration, SES presents the winners of the World Standards Day Paper Competition.  The competition is co-sponsored with the Planning Committee and the judging is done by a panel selected by SES.  The first, second, and third place awards are given to the author or authors for a paper prepared on the theme of World Standards Day\n\nThe SES National Capital Area Section provides programs and networking opportunities for members in the Washington, D.C. metro area.

I have been considering moving further sections out for some time. I have already moved several so far. Culture was on my list. I think we should be very careful about using the term splitting. GA and FA pages use a lot of redirect hats to subpages, with a summary of that page underneath. I hope that is what we are talking about here. It is very easy to mess up a good page that has numerous internal cross references, to say nothing of the lead and references. I was going to leave the bibliography intact - this is the master page after all. So the process has to be done very carefully. I would strongly advise against anyone trying to create multiple subpages simultaneously. And anyway each subpage should preserve GA status and be separately reviewed. Do you want to leave it with me since I am very familiar with the structure of the page which I wrote pretty well from scratch?

It is also the principal provider of work-related further education in the Worthing area.\n\n==Overview==\nThe college's Worthing campuses are the University Centre Worthing in West Durrington, The Broadwater Campus and The Business Development Centre at Liverpool Gardens (Worthing Town).  The college's Shoreham campus is at [[Shoreham Airport]].\n\nNorthbrook was previously West Sussex College of Design (WSCD) but amalgamated with Worthing Technical College and Chelsea College of Aeronautical and Automobile Engineering in 1985-86. Whilst the college retained its central Worthing site in Union Place, West Sussex County Council (WSCC) closed the workshops in Homefield Place, which were knocked down and are now the [[Environment Agency]] headquarters for the area.\n\nThe college is the largest provider of [[Higher Education]] for the creative and cultural industries in [[West Sussex]]. It is also a significant provider of Higher Education in a variety of other work-related areas. The College, additionally, has contracts for [[Apprenticeship#United Kingdom|apprenticeship]] training and adult and community learning, and provides courses in most work-related areas as well as those for personal development. It also runs courses at [[HMP Ford]].\n\nThe college is also home to the [[Southern Theatre Arts Centre]], providing theatre courses ranging from [[National Diploma (UK)|National Diploma]]s to Foundation Degrees and BA Hons, which like all Northbrook's higher education courses are affiliated with the [[University of Brighton]].

Also please note that Mahavamsa is not a fact book or a complete history, so you must not ever say \"Mahavamsa didn't say it, so it is not true\", like you did in a couple of your recent edits, about the \"native\" claim of our Tamil brothers. :) There are enough and more reliable sources to use for that matter. The myth about the 4 tribes in the Naga article has to be presented as a myth. I have left a post there, they are my own thoughts and ideas about why I think the article needs to be revised\/rewritten. I will try to contribute in that article and give some points and references when I get the time. Also I will write a comment on the article on the Ethnic Conflict which is listed to be deleted, there too you have to use other sources and not refer to the Mahavamsa. If you find it hard to understand why that is so, please read [[WP:PRIMARY]] and [[WP:SOURCE]] . The point is, you can't present what Mahavamsa says, with your interpretation of it; if you are to use Mahavamsa (which I hope u will restrict to the minimum) you have to present it exactly as it is, and not interpret it yourself. Eg. The Mahavamsa does not say that the Tamils are native to Sri Lanka, but it does not say that they are not native to Sri Lanka either. One has to read all of Mahavamsa, and interprete the stories in the Mahavamsa to find it out - that's where scholars come in. So you can't revert an edit and say that it is not true because the Mahavamsa did not say it. Hope u understand what I am trying to say..... Regards Suren. --[[User:SriSuren|SriSuren]] ([[User talk:SriSuren|talk]]) 18:40, 26 July 2012 (UTC)\n\nThanks for the feedback. There are several books published about Mahavamsa. I'll do my best to give much more reliable things even from Mahavamsa. \n\nMahavamsa (Mahavamsa, Chulavamsa, DeepaVamsa) are serious of books written in Sri Lanka which tackled historical events. Those are the reference to many articles even kingdom of Jaffna, Kalinga Magha,.. If no Mahavamsa, no one knows about Kalinga Magha and why Rajarata was abandon even they find a golden civilazation with water reservoirs , Stupas, huge buildings. Mahavamsa contain details about historical events from king Devanampiyatissa. It is also referenced about Tamil invasion to Sri Lanka and how Sinhalese regain. In historical events there is no references about Tamil areas. It was Rajarata,Malaya rata, Ruhunu rata. But it started to write about Tamil areas after 1215. That is Mahavamsa saying Tamils are not native to Sri Lanka. \nI hope you will updated readers with Tamil kingdoms and Tamil kings who ruled those areas to support your claims. \n\nAlso my personal idea is those tribes are not myth. They were real. In history we can find references to them from different time periods and different sources from even different countries. \n* First it is mentioned in Ramayana. Raksha,Yaksha,Naga\n* Then lord Buddha has come to visit Sri Lanka there are specific references about Yaksha and Naga.\n* The establishing kingdom of Anuradhapura it is mentioned how Yaksha tribes and Sinha clan fought. King Pandukabhaya is belongs to Yaksha tribe. He has build Temples to two Yaksha leaders.In history king Pandukabhaya is not a myth. He was for certain a historical ruler. Also there were 10 Naga kings who ruled the Anuradhapura. \n\nPeople divided into those tribes purely they worshiped certain entities. They are human beings who worshipped Raksha, Yaksha, Naga, Deva. It is clear that Buddhism came to Sri Lanka in 250BCE. In history it is mentioned that worshiping Raksha,Yaksha, Naga, Deva were the religions before SL converted to Buddhism. My idea is considering all facts\/references from all over the continents they should be in the history not in myths. --[[User:Himesh84|Himesh84]] ([[User talk:Himesh84#top|talk]]) 06:04, 27 July 2012 (UTC)\n\n==[[Report of the Secretary-General's Panel of Experts on Accountability in Sri Lanka]]==\n\nI have reported you at ANI for the violation of pushing POV and introducing [[WP:OR]] on the above article.[[User:Sudar123|Sudar123]] ([[User talk:Sudar123|talk]]) 13:43, 6 September 2012 (UTC)\n==Notice of Dispute resolution discussion==\nHello.

Our goal here is '''''not''''' to determine the one clearly correct viewpoint on a subject and promote that viewpoint to the exclusion of all others.  To quote the policy, we need to be ''\"representing fairly, proportionately, and as far as possible without bias, all significant views that have been [[WP:V|published by reliable sources]].\"''  The \"significance\" of a view is determined by how it is represented in reliable sources.  As far as possible, the \"reliable sources\" we are required to use are '''''secondary''''' sources (see [[WP:PSTS]]), such as scholarly journal articles, books, and reports in newspapers with broad coverage and high respectability.\n\n::::This is '''''almost always''''' going to mean that an article on a political topic is going to mention two or more differing views on the subject \u2014 each view backed by its own sources, and with the conflicting issues carefully described in such a way that a reader who is not familiar with the subject can get a basic understanding of the various sides, determine where to find more information, and make up his\/her own mind as to which (if any) of the opposing views appears to be correct.\n\n::::We '''''can not''''' say that because one viewpoint on a subject is endorsed by some particularly prestigious person or institution (be it the UN Human Rights Commission, the United States Supreme Court, the Pope, the Dalai Lama, or whomever\/whatever), we must present that viewpoint as the only legitimate viewpoint.  If generally reputable sources discuss and\/or endorse opposing views, the NPOV policy requires that we give fair coverage to these other views, without regard to whether some may think this is \"insulting\" to some other organization or person.  Some examples of how NPOV is applied to complex topics might be found in articles about the [[American Civil War]], the [[2000 United States presidential election]], and the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]].\n\n::::I'm sorry if you find the NPOV policy (or the way it needs to be applied to the Sri Lankan conflict) to be distasteful, but the policy (to quote again therefrom) ''\"is nonnegotiable and all editors and articles must follow it.\"''  If you disagree with the '''''way''''' the NPOV policy is being applied to a given article by other editors, you are allowed (and encouraged) to bring up the issue at the Neutral Point of View Noticeboard ([[WP:NPOVN]]) for discussion.  But an open refusal to respect the NPOV policy as such \u2014 including an insistence on editing a given article or articles in a manner which openly defies the policy \u2014 '''''is not going to get you anywhere''''' and is only likely to result in your being blocked from editing entirely.  \u2014 [[User:Richwales|<u>Rich<\/u>]][[User talk:Richwales|wales]] 20:14, 16 October 2012 (UTC)\n\n:::::Himesh84's response above shows, he can't understand at all how Wikipedia works.

I've rearranged the source citations in the last paragraph of the lead to make it clearer which source corresponded to the pro-government and anti-government views.\n\nAdditionally, after looking at what appears to be the source for the UNHRC's comment on the LLRC report (see [http:\/\/www.ohchr.org\/en\/NewsEvents\/Pages\/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11896&LangID=E here]), I believe it may be inaccurate to say that the UNHRC \"endorsed\" the LLRC report or urged the implementation of its recommendations.  The relevant quote from the UNHRC's statement says this:  ''\"I welcome the publication by the Government of Sri Lanka last December of its Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission. While the report falls short of the comprehensive accountability process recommended by the Secretary-General\u2019s Panel of Experts, it does make important recommendations. I encourage the Government to engage with the Special Procedures and with my Office on follow up to the report. I also hope the Council will discuss these important reports.\"''\n\nI apologize for not having noticed the above point before now.  In any case, to \"welcome the publication\" of the LLRC report falls far short of \"endorsing\" said report; encouraging the Sri Lankan government to follow up on the LLRC report by working with the UNHRC is not necessarily the same as urging implementation of the report's recommendations; and even if we were not trying to satisfy Wikipedia's NPOV policy, this statement (in my opinion) falls far short of a level of approval that would demand recognition as the final word and rule out any discussion of opposing views.  Something like the following might be a better paragraph for the lead section:\n\n''A competing report was produced by Sri Lanka's [[Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission]] (LLRC).  In 2012, the [[United Nations Human Rights Commission]] (UNHRC) issued a statement welcoming the publication of this report (while acknowledging problems therein) and urging the Sri Lankan government to follow up by working with the UNHRC. The LLRC report has been praised in Sri Lanka, but criticised by opponents of the island's government.''\n\nIt may be that the actual, full report of the UNHRC says more than what the above introductory statement says \u2014 in which case it might be appropriate to reword the lead.  But, in any case, I need to point out that we should be looking for a wider base of reliable secondary sources to report on and discuss the UNHRC's reaction, rather than rely too directly on the primary source documents themselves.  \u2014 [[User:Richwales|<u>Rich<\/u>]][[User talk:Richwales|wales]] 17:13, 18 October 2012 (UTC)\n\n: opponents of the Sri Lankan government doesn't make any sense. That's why I removed it. If you says opponents of Richwales, then readers might get confused and they needs to search who are the opponents in Wikipedia or google. opponents can be change time to time also. May be better to clearly specify who are the parties you meant by \"opponents\". May be you referring the opposition parties of Sri Lankan government. I don't know what it says if I use terms like \"opponents of Russian government \",\"opponents of USA government \",.. . USA is also a opponent of this government due to close relationship of Sri Lanka and China. But USA praised the report. \n\n: Second paraghraph of the wsws article\n\n: The resolution urges the Colombo government to implement the recommendations of its own Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC), to take steps \u201cto ensure justice, equity, accountability and reconciliation.\u201d It calls for an \u201caction plan\u201d and for the UN Human Rights Commissioner to work \u201cin consultation with, and with the concurrence\u201d of the Sri Lankan government in implementing the LLRC proposals.\n\n: Your following statement is not a valid due to above paragraph.\n:encouraging the Sri Lankan government to follow up on the LLRC report by working with the UNHRC is not necessarily the same as urging implementation of the report's recommendations.\n: So it is there clearly. So if it is there why it is not allowed ?--[[User:Himesh84|Himesh84]] ([[User talk:Himesh84#top|talk]]) 18:41, 19 October 2012 (UTC)\n\n::This is actually a good example of why we need, wherever possible, to find '''''secondary sources''''' to interpret primary material and place it in its proper context, rather than for us (Wikipedia editors) to work directly with the primary sources ourselves.  The comment in the WSWS.org article, about how the UNHRC urged the Sri Lankan government to implement the recommendations in its LLRC report, is clearly (at least, clearly to me) '''''not''''' any sort of endorsement of either the Sri Lankan government or the UNHRC.  As I peruse the rest of that article, it's clear that the writer is not only opposed to the Sri Lankan government, but is also opposed to the UN's actions, as well as the actions of the USA.\n\n::Just to be sure there is no confusion, by the way, it also appears clear to me that the ''Sri Lanka News'' article is little more than a government press release, and that the editors of this news source are most likely either allied with the Sri Lankan government, or else they are on a very short leash and are not at liberty to criticize their government.  So both these sources are, in my view, of questionable quality '''''except''''' as primary-source opinion pieces from two very different camps.\n\n::More (and better) sources are needed here \u2014 again, '''''secondary sources''''' (such as high-quality newspaper, magazine, and journal articles which talk about the events), and sources covering all possible sides of the controversy.  \u2014 [[User:Richwales|<u>Rich<\/u>]][[User talk:Richwales|wales]] 21:52, 19 October 2012 (UTC)\n\n::: Ok. I will attach more reliable sources. But can you please correct the opponents of the Sri Lankan government sentence. This is where it says UNP ,the main opposition party supports LLRC [http:\/\/www.thesundayleader.lk\/2012\/03\/27\/unp-backs-llrc-report\/]. This is the where it says TNA backs the resolution to implement LLRC [http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/sinhala\/news\/story\/2012\/03\/120312_unhrc_tamil.shtml]. Since you warned me and you bring this case again due to removing \"opponents ... \" by me, I can't do it. May be you are referring JHU and DNA(JVP). But JHU is not a opposition party. They are partners of the government. Minister Champika Ranawaka (JHU) is a minister of the government. As I found, from opponents of Ruling government only JVP criticized the LLRC. This is the composition of Sri Lankan parliment [[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Parliament_of_Sri_Lanka]]. There are 81 seats for opposition parties. From that 74 (UNP,TNA) backs the LLRC. It is not correct to say opposition criticize the report only considering 7 when there are 74 opposition party members back it. --[[User:Himesh84|Himesh84]] ([[User talk:Himesh84#top|talk]]) 14:04, 20 October 2012 (UTC)\n\n::::I really don't have any more authority to \"correct\" this article than you or any other editor.

This same advice applies to Sudar, or anyone else reading this.

The \"incidents\" noticeboard ([[WP:ANI]]) is really intended for more urgent issues requiring immediate administrator intervention.  At the moment, the problem here appears (to me, at least) to be a content dispute, involving editors who have extreme differences in viewpoint, but who are at least willing to \"try to try\" to talk.  The talking has, to be sure, strayed more than once into name-calling and borderline personal attacks, but even though people have deeply entrenched opposing views (and might find it horribly offensive to even consider the other side's positions), I think it's still possible for some sort of balanced, neutral result to come out of it.  I will say, though, that if there are any further instances of edit-warring, attacks on the character or motives of others with differing views, or an attitude of \"my view is the only acceptable view, everything else is wretched propaganda\", then this dispute most likely '''''will''''' end up back at WP:ANI.  If that happens, and if the existing participants turn out to be so profoundly tied to their points of view that they cannot tolerate anything coming from the other side, it may ultimately be necessary to ask '''''all''''' such people (on both sides) to refrain from working on this and related articles '''''at all''''', and instead allow other editors (people with no ties to the dispute and no commitment to either of the sides) to take over the task of sifting through the available sources and try to come up with something that fairly represents all the views in keeping with the [[WP:NPOV|NPOV]] policy.  \u2014 [[User:Richwales|<u>Rich<\/u>]][[User talk:Richwales|wales]] 05:56, 21 October 2012 (UTC)\n\n::::::::Richwales, I have altered the lead para as per, \"[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Himesh84&diff=518545949&oldid=518509135 your suggestion cited with more reliable source]\".[[User:Sudar123|Sudar123]] ([[User talk:Sudar123|talk]]) 19:14, 24 October 2012 (UTC)\n\n::::::: I didn't come to [[WP:ANI]] on my will.

Elamists are Separatists who want to divide Sri Lanka and make new Tamil Country proposed as \"Ealam\". Elamist are extremist who want separatism. They never want any negotiation.

You should not forget the context that I used it.If he is proud about calling him Eelamists I don't think there is a insult or other problem.

But they become separatists when the majority group poses threat for their existence or survival by forceful annihilation or systematic assimilation within the majority group. Separatism is not a taboo within the UN Circle since you believe UNHRC. [[East Timor]] and [[Republic of Kosovo]] are included within the UN System as member countries in the recent past. UN or other majority of member countries never forced those countries to go for more detail negotiation and withdraw their demand for independence. If someone argues Eelam Tamils demad of creating Tamil Eelam is an offence within Sri Lanka; then the British Raj which united traditional Tamil areas for the administrative purposes into other areas of Sri Lanka, should have annexed Sri Lanka as another state of India when they left the region since India itself is a creation by the British Raj by uniting various princely and independent states. Sri Lanka has all its qualifications to be a state of India than an independent country since both Sinhalese and Tamils came from India. Buddhism and Hinduism also came from India. If India can legitimately claim the right for [[Andaman Islands]] which is some hundreds of miles from the Indian Sub Continent, there is no reason why India should not claim its stake over Sri Lanka which is only 20 - 30 miles away. If someone finds offence with the demand of Eelam Tamils for Separation; Sri Lanka has no reason to be an Independent State, but a state of India.[[User:Sudar123|Sudar123]] ([[User talk:Sudar123|talk]]) 19:58, 24 October 2012 (UTC)\n\n:::::::: Sri Lanka wasn't been part of any other country except for British in 1815-1947 for known 5000 years. It was a independent country since Ramayana era. Origin of Sinhalese are still unknown. According to myths Sinhalese start from price Vijaya who came to Sri Lanka in 543BC. But same myth describes there were clans (mainly Yaksha) lived in Sri Lanka ( princes Kuveni) when prince Vijaya was coming. Later in 343BC thrown go to the local Yaksha price Pandukabhaya after a great battle with Indians. Pandukabhaya is not a myth but he is the founder of the great kingdom of Anuradhapura. Vijaya's clan mixed into community but Yaksha ruled the country as majority. \n:::::::: British Raj didn't had any uniting or seperism processes. When they came to India , the great Mugal (Muslims who ruled Most parts of India since 1200 with Delhi Sultanate) ruled half of India and Maratha Empire ruled other half. So British accepted Muslims had some ownership. But in Sri Lanka it was totally different. Only Sinhalese kingdom was there when they came. Jaffna kingdom was created when [[Delhi Sultanate]] of India invaded Tamil capital Madurai in 1340 to kill last Pandyan king and Annex it. Jaffna kingdom only existed until 1582 (250) years until it became client state of Portuguese. But Sinhala kingdom was there since 347BC - 1815 ( at least 2500 years). British had fair concerns to divide India and not divide Sri Lanka. Europeans(1582-1946 : 264 years) ruled Jaffna longer than Tamils (1340-1582 : 242 years ). It was part of Sinhalese [[kingdom of Rajarata]] from 343BC to 1215 (1500 years). Tamils in the North still using the lakes ( Giant's tank in Mannar, Kantale tank ) build by Sinhalese. If you think Jaffna should be given to Tamils due to 250 years of Tamil rule why British shouldn't think it should be given to Sinhalese for 1500 years rule ? --[[User:Himesh84|Himesh84]] ([[User talk:Himesh84#top|talk]]) 16:45, 25 October 2012 (UTC)\n\n:::::::::Sinhalese don't have 5000 years old history in Sri Lanka, but various tribes which has came into Sri Lanka through India since India was a crossing zone for ancient human population. Those tribes contributed to the formation of the Sinhalese tribes and the Tamil tribes as well. Your claim that, \"Origin of Sinhalese are still unknown\" shows you are still in the archaic mind set and live with myths. [[Genetic studies on Sinhalese]] shows who are Sinhalese genetically  and their relationship with majority of current Indian population. Many ancient Sri Lankan kings who are claimed as Sinhalese are not necessarily Sinhalese, but from different tribal groups and later on their descendants assimilated within the Sinhalese tribe. Giant Tanks in Sri Lanka are built by these tribal kings probably borrowing the technology from South Indians who could boast for their [[Grand Anicut]] which is considered to be one of the oldest water-diversion or water-regulator structures in the world, which is still in use.\n\n:::::::::Though I used the term \"British Raj\", what I really meant is \"British Empire\". The British Empire concurrently ruled Sri Lanka and India. If they could have united Delhi Sultanate with Maratha Empire, I could't understand why they can't unite the tiny Sri Lanka with the same Indian Sub Continental Administrative process. These are only anomalies and not that they considered more than 5000 years old history of Sri Lanka of various tribes which Sinhalese claims as their own. Maratha Empire can boast much more ancient heritage than Sri Lanka for an argument.\n\n:::::::::I want to cut short this discussion on this thread on this topic and we can discuss elsewhere when time comes.[[User:Sudar123|Sudar123]] ([[User talk:Sudar123|talk]]) 01:51, 26 October 2012 (UTC)\n \n:::::::::: Now Sri Lanka mainly contains 3 ethnic groups. Sinhalese , Tamils, Muslims. Sinhalese are people who abandon\/expelled to south after the massive Tamil invasion in 1215 from Kingdom of Rajarata in North. They may contain different ethnic groups (natives (Yakka), Tamils, Bengalis) but as you said later on their descendants assimilated within the Sinhalese tribe. They have more than 5000 years old history in Sri Lanka and they are the people called as Sinhalese. What ever race they belonged their clear descendants are in the Sinhalese community so Tamils can claim those heritage considering what language those ancients spoken when they first came to Sri Lanka. Sinhalese means all of them before 1215. The people known as Tamils in today came in 1215 from South India and expelled all the People to south , destroyed the Kingdom which lasted from 343BC to 1215. They don't have history more than 800 years in Sri Lanka. \n\n:::::::::: You should have better understand about Sinhalese before commenting about them. I don't know who did [[Genetic studies on Sinhalese]] and what it says so I am not commenting about that. Refer the links in this article [[Prehistory_of_Sri_Lanka]].  Fa Hien Cave has yielded the earliest evidence (at c. 34,000 BP) of anatomically modern humans in South Asia. So better you find something older than Fa Hien man to say Sinhalese came from India or anywhere else in South Asia. \n\n:::::::::: They give separate area to Muslims considering the Muslims effects from 1200 to 1850. When  British came Muslims had 650 years of powerful rule (They ruled most part of current India)in India. But when they came to Sri Lanka there wasn't a kingdom for Tamils. It was vanished since 1600. Legally it was belonged to Sinhalese since all the descendants of the Tamil king was killed by Portugese. The only remained daughters of Canci II were married by sons of Sinhalese king Senarath.  --[[User:Himesh84|Himesh84]] ([[User talk:Himesh84#top|talk]]) 15:28, 27 October 2012 (UTC)\n             \n:::::::::With all possible respect to both of you, I don't think you're doing your respective causes any good by lobbing accusations at each other and perpetuating this centuries-long feud.

When I suggested a merge, I meant \"summarize the position of Sri Lankan government in a couple of sentences\", not \"dump the whole article into the [[Report of the Secretary-General's Panel of Experts on Accountability in Sri Lanka|main page]]. The article already covers the position of the Sri Lankan government in the [[Report of the Secretary-General's Panel of Experts on Accountability in Sri Lanka#Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]] section. If you believe this section needs to be expanded, feel free to; however, it should not go beyond a brief summary, and should not state the Sri Lankan stance as a fact. (See the policy of [[WP:NPOV|neutrality]].) - [[User:Mike Rosoft|Mike Rosoft]] ([[User talk:Mike Rosoft|talk]]) 08:24, 27 November 2012 (UTC)\n* There was also another problem with the article: a part of it has been copied from the official statement of the Sri Lankan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which claims copyright to the text. I don't know what the law of Sri Lanka says on the copyright of such official documents (in the Czech Republic, they are exempt from copyright), but unless it is under a [[free content|free license]] or in [[public domain]], it cannot be copied to Wikipedia as such. (Naturally, you can use the document as a source, as long as you summarize its content using your own words. [Copying the text with slight rephrasings is NOT sufficient; it needs to be written from the scratch. See the [[WP:C|copyright policy]].] Even if the document is in public domain, Wikipedia is not an appropriate place to copy it in its entirety - consider uploading it to Wikisource instead.) - [[User:Mike Rosoft|Mike Rosoft]] ([[User talk:Mike Rosoft|talk]]) 08:58, 27 November 2012 (UTC)\n\nAlso, I strongly recommend you to discuss the changes you intend to make on the [[Talk:Report of the Secretary-General's Panel of Experts on Accountability in Sri Lanka|talk page]]; [[WP:EW|revert warring]] is frowned upon on Wikipedia, and may result in you being [[WP:BLOCK|blocked]] from editing. - [[User:Mike Rosoft|Mike Rosoft]] ([[User talk:Mike Rosoft|talk]]) 09:05, 27 November 2012 (UTC)\n* The same goes for the article [[Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission]]. - [[User:Mike Rosoft|Mike Rosoft]] ([[User talk:Mike Rosoft|talk]]) 09:20, 27 November 2012 (UTC)\n\n: It is not possible to merge it couple of sentences. Anyway I guess it is only your opinion and not the wikipedia policy says criticism should be done with couple of sentences and other part can be grow , long as users wish.\n: If it is a fork it should merge to relevant place. Without relevancy anything can't be categorized as fork. \n: If executive summary is written as well proven facts why Sri Lankan stance can't be used ?\n: There want be anymore copy right issues. Totally written in my words.\n: If you want to block, block after removing all the contribution by me. It is not ethical to block me while keeping my free effort with you--Himesh84 11:52, 27 November 2012 (UTC)\n* Since your additions to the article were repeatedly rejected and removed (both by me and other users), I would like to reiterate what I asked you: please do not make major edits to the article without consensus on the talk page. In paricular, please '''don't create a \"Criticism of the report\" section'''. The position of the Sri Lankan government is already covered in the \"Sri Lanka\" section; adequately, in my opinion. (I am not ruling out the possibility of expanding the section - but please discuss your proposed changes on the talk page first. Note: \"discuss\" doesn't mean \"state your opinion and then go ahead with the edit\".) You also grossly misinterpret the decision of the deletion debate. It was concluded as a speedy deletion - '''NOT as a merge'''. Finally, you have no right to demand the removal of your contributions, even if you were to be blocked. By submitting them to Wikipedia, you have given Wikipedia and everybody else the right to use - or not to use - them under the terms of the [[Wikipedia:Text of Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License|Creative Commons license]]. - [[User:Mike Rosoft|Mike Rosoft]] ([[User talk:Mike Rosoft|talk]]) 14:31, 27 November 2012 (UTC)\n** It may create copyright problems. I don't know. I may have copied content directly from servers still haven't go public.\n** \"Criticism of the report\" and stand of the Sri Lankan government are two things. You should refer LLRC report and find wikipedia policies are different from page to page. Why LLRC has \"Criticism of report and why this report can't have ? Both are competitive reports. If you saying Critism of report should not included may I delete same section from LLRC and merge contents to the reaction?\n** It was concluded as speedy deletion. And why ? It is concluded as a fork. It means Not because content are false there are something else to include.. Isn't that ? So you don't giving me where it exist ? You alone decided it is not a fork ? If it is a fork give me the location to insert --Himesh84 16:44, 27 November 2012 (UTC)\n*** For the second time: please don't insert it anywhere. Deletion of the article as a fork is '''absolutely not''' a license for you to insert the material in the main article; otherwise, the discussion would have been concluded as a merge.<p>Why doesn't the article about the [[Report of the Secretary-General's Panel of Experts on Accountability in Sri Lanka|United Nations report]] have a \"Criticism\" section? Because the report has only been criticized by Sri Lanka, and Sri Lanka's response is already covered in the article. Adding a \"Criticism\" section that would cover the position of the Sri Lankan government (as you did) would have been redundant. Got it? (I am not ruling out the expansion of the Sri Lanka section. However, before making any major changes or additions you need to make your case on the talk page, and don't go ahead without consensus. - [[User:Mike Rosoft|Mike Rosoft]] ([[User talk:Mike Rosoft|talk]]) 09:43, 28 November 2012 (UTC)\n* The article on the [[Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission|Sri Lankan commission]] has a section on criticism of the commission, and another one on responses to its report.

I think the reason \"SineBot\" is being overly helpful (by adding a signature to your \"unsigned\" posts) is that you appear to have customized your signature in such a way that it's no longer being recognized by the bot as being a signature.\n\nThe problem, I believe, is that your current signature doesn't include a link to your user page or your talk page.  A signature without a user link is technically a violation of the signature guidelines, by the way (see [[WP:SIGLINK]]) \u2014 you're unlikely to be called on the carpet for this alone, but I would strongly recommend you fix it ASAP.  Either disable your custom signature and use Wikipedia's default, or else use something minimal like this:  '''<nowiki>[[User talk:Himesh84|Himesh84]]<\/nowiki>'''\n\nSetting up a custom signature can be tricky; if you have any questions about how to do this right, let me know and I'll be more than happy to help in any way I can.  \u2014&nbsp;[[User:Richwales|<u>Rich<\/u>]][[User talk:Richwales|wales]] <small>''(no&nbsp;relation to Jimbo)''<\/small> 17:07, 29 January 2013 (UTC)\n: Thanks for identifying that there is a problem. I haven't customized my signature or done anything to my signature. I put my signed signature to my talk page because others repeatedly asking about my signatures. I suspect any activities of Mike Rosoft or other one who blocked me lead to this situation. Also MikeRosoft had done experiments in Wikipedia blocking SineBot. Anyway, can you please link me to correct location ( wikipage) to correct this issue ?\n\n::Go to your \"Preferences\" page at this location \u2014  '''[{{fullurl:Special:Preferences}} http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Preferences]'''\n\n::On the '''\"User profile\"''' tab (which should show up first by default), scroll down and look for the box entitled '''\"Signature\"'''.  To remove any customization and go to the default signature, clear the text box (leaving nothing there at all, not even spaces); uncheck the '''\"Treat the above as wiki markup\"''' check-box; and then go all the way to the bottom of the page and click the '''\"Save\"''' button.\n\n::It is not normally possible for one person to access or modify another person's preference settings.  Not even an admin can do that \u2014 it would have to be either someone with ultimate superuser privileges on the Wikipedia servers (a level of access which I'm sure Mike Rosoft does not have), or else someone hacking into your account.  If there is any possibility that someone might have stolen your password and logged in as you, I would strongly advise you to use the Wikipedia [[WP:SEC|secure server]] from now on \u2014 go to '''<nowiki>https:\/\/www.wikipedia.org<\/nowiki>''' (note the '''https''' with an '''s'''), change your password to something new '''''after''''' making the switch to the secure ('''https''') site, and use the secure site to access Wikipedia from now on.  If you can install the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]'s [https:\/\/www.eff.org\/https-everywhere-node '''HTTPS-Everywhere''' add-on] in your web browser, this is a good way to make sure you will always use Wikipedia's secure site and protect your password from snooping.  Note that you need to change your password '''''after''''' transitioning to the secure server; if you change your password first, while still using the regular ('''http''') server, someone could potentially see it in unencrypted traffic during the short window of time before you switch over to using the secure server.  \u2014&nbsp;[[User:Richwales|<u>Rich<\/u>]][[User talk:Richwales|wales]] <small>''(no&nbsp;relation to Jimbo)''<\/small> <s>19:03, 29 January 2013 (UTC)<\/s> 23:40, 29 January 2013 (UTC)\n::: It is working.

This applies to user talk pages (see my user talk page, for example, and note how \"wales\" shows up as '''wales''' instead of [[User talk:Richwales|wales]]) \u2014 and it also applies to regular articles (e.g., if a page contains a wikilink that points back to the same page).

Your removal of tags is causing problems on pages relating to Sri Lanka Tamils but, for most of the rest of us, it is impossible to figure out who is right or wrong on content issues.

Several multi-pitch alpine climbing routes have been established on its steep SE flanks.\n\n==History==\nMount Tom Taylor is named in honor of a politician involved in the development of [[Strathcona Provincial Park]]:<ref>BC Geographical Names Information System, Mount Tom Taylor<\/ref>\n<blockquote>\nNamed after the Honorable [[Thomas Taylor (Canadian politician)|Thomas Taylor]] (1865 - 1947), who, as minister of Public Works, had been instrumental in securing government funds for the survey & construction of roads and general development of Strathcona Park: \"The Hon. Thomas Taylor... intends to spare no pains to secure through here the finest drives to be found anywhere, and... Sir Richard McBride is very desirous that the park be developed to its utmost....\" (The Great Playground on Vancouver Island, British Columbia Magazine, Vol 9, No 7, July 1913, p.370.) The onset of World War I, and a shortage of government funds brought the elaborate development plans to a halt. Prior to assuming a cabinet post, Taylor listed his profession as mineral broker, then mining recorder. He served as Minister of Works [Public Works] December 1908 - December 1915, and held a dual portfolio as Minister of Railways March 1911 - December 1915.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n==Access==\n[[Image:Tom Taylor Lake.JPG|thumb|200px|The unnamed lake NE of Mount Tom Taylor that the access trail reaches]]\nMount Tom Taylor is frequently accessed from Bedwell Lake and the Bedwell Lake Trail.  A trail starts between Baby Bedwell Lake and Bedwell Lake, in a sharp bend in the Bedwell Lake Trail.  The trail heads west, then south, roughly following the edge of Bedwell Lake.  It climbs steeply to meet Mount Tom Taylor's NE ridge at an unnamed lake.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of mountains in Canada]]\n* [[List of mountains in Strathcona Provincial Park]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tom Taylor}}\n[[Category:Vancouver Island Ranges]]\n[[Category:Mid Vancouver Island]]\n[[Category:Mountains of British Columbia]]\n\n\n{{BritishColumbia-geo-stub}}","timestamp":"20160410100816","user-timestamp":0},{"title":"Serra da Malcata Natural Reserve","content":"'''Serra da Malcata Natural Reserve''' is a natural reserve in Portugal.
