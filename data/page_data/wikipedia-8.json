A few years after his birth, Everitt Blizard moved with his family from Canada to [[Pittsburgh]] and then to [[Garden City, New York]]. He earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry from [[Wesleyan University]] in 1938 and a master's degree in physics from [[Columbia University]] in 1941. While working for his PhD at Columbia, he was recruited by the U.S. Navy for work as a physicist. After spending the war years working for the Navy and working on [[Operation Crossroads]] in 1946, he was recruited by Admiral [[Hyman Rickover]] to work at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|ORNL]] for the Navy's nuclear reactor program. Blizard was appointed the group leader of shielding research in the Physics Division of ORNL and then was promoted to associate division director in 1954. In 1955 he became director of the Neutron Physics Division, continuing in this position until his death from leukemia in 1966. He was the most important physicist and engineer for nuclear reactor shielding for the submarines [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|''Nautilus'']] and [[USS Seawolf (SSN-575)|''Seawolf'']] and the ship [[NS Savannah|''Savannah'']].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Obituary: Everitt P. Blizard|journal=Physics Today|date=April 1966|volume=19|issue=4|pages=126\u2013127|url=http:\/\/www.physicstoday.org\/resource\/1\/phtoad\/v19\/i4\/p126_s3?bypassSSO=1|doi=10.1063\/1.3048162}}<\/ref> At ORNL he directed the development of four major test facilities for research in nuclear reactor shielding. His pioneering team developed experiments, models, and nuclear data essential for shielding and introduced the concept of neutron removal cross-section.<ref>[http:\/\/www.ans.org\/honors\/scholarships\/blizard.php Everitt Pinnell Blizard (1916-1966), American Nuclear Society \/ Honors and Awards \/ Scholarships]<\/ref> Blizard won the 1966 [[Elliott Cresson Medal]].\n\nBefore completing his doctorate work, he was employed by the Navy in 1941. As a result of his contributions in such programs as the \"CROSSROADS\" atom bomb tests at Bikini, he was selected by Captain Hyman Rickover to participate in the nuclear submarine program and was sent to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to attend the charter session of a nuclear training school. Although intended to be temporary, his stay in Oak Ridge continued until his death from leukemia in 1966.\n\"Bliz,\" as he was better known, began with a small group of pioneers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and developed a significant division of researchers addressing all aspects of radiation shielding, including experiments, analytical models, and nuclear data. Four major test facilities were constructed under his leadership, beginning with the \"Core Hole\" facility - a 2-ft-square hole in the shield of the original X-10 Graphite Reactor. Although immediately successful, the facility had significant limitations, and the group went on to develop more powerful and more flexible test facilities, including the Lid Tank Shielding Facility, the Bulk Shielding Facility, and the Tower Shielding Facility. This latter facility provided the international shielding community with abundant benchmark data over a span of nearly four decades. Blizard also recognized the importance of analytic methods and was instrumental in bringing theoretical physicists together to develop and apply new methods. His exploitation of the concept of a neutron removal cross section had, perhaps, the widest impact on early methods development.\nBeyond Bliz's technical leadership, his humanistic interest and sensitivity toward others often led him into a role as international ambassador for reactor shielding. He was one of the scientific members of the U.S. Atoms for Peace Mission to the Far East in 1957 and participated in numerous other outreach missions. He also contributed substantially to many handbooks and encyclopedias, including the shielding portion of the Reactor Handbook and the Engineering Compendium on Radiation Shielding.\nBecause of this vision, his technical alertness, and his warm and inspiring personality, Blizard is rightly recognized as the \"father of reactor shielding\" and is credited with bringing the field of reactor radiation shielding from an empirical rule-of-thumb craft to a distinct discipline in nuclear science and technology.\nAs with many scientists of his day, he was a warm human being who inspired many young people to attain goals they never thought were possible. He had a knack for selecting the right individual for the job and giving them the guidance and trust they needed to succeed.\n<ref> Extracted from eulogy written by Herbert Goldstein, Nuclear Science and Engineering, Vol 27, No. 2 (February 1967).<\/ref>\n\nOn 1 January 1943 he married Barbara Rogers and had a son Steven in 1948.\n\nA scholarship is given in his name each year to a student enrolled in graduate-level studies in the field of radiation protection and shielding by the American Nuclear Society. \n\n<ref>{{cite journal|title=Blizard-Rogers Wedding on New Year's Day Revealed|journal=Brooklyn Eagle|date=6 January 1943|url=http:\/\/fultonhistory.com\/Newspaper%205\/Brooklyn%20NY%20Daily%20Eagle\/Brooklyn%20NY%20Daily%20Eagle%201943%20Grayscale\/Brooklyn%20NY%20Daily%20Eagle%201943%20Grayscale%20-%200106.pdf}}<\/ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Blizard, Everitt\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES = Blizard, Everitt Pinnell\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American physicist\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 30 September 1916\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = Ottawa, Canada\n| DATE OF DEATH     = 22 February 1966\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Blizard, Everitt}}\n[[Category:1916 births]]\n[[Category:1966 deaths]]\n[[Category:Columbia University alumni]]\n[[Category:Wesleyan University alumni]]\n[[Category:American nuclear engineers]]\n[[Category:American nuclear physicists]]\n[[Category:Oak Ridge National Laboratory people]]\n[[Category:American military personnel of World War II]]\n[[Category:United States Navy personnel]]","timestamp":"20160410103641","user-timestamp":"20150410103641"},{"title":"User talk:74.176.165.225","content":"\n\n== February 2010 ==\n[[Image:Information.svg|25px]] Welcome to Wikipedia.

The band works collaboratively to come up with the funky riffs and beats that compliment the serious yet \u201cfloetic\u201d nature of their informatively controversial lyrics. Jason Raymond (Born 08\/07\/87) and Zach Pero (Born 02\/24\/83) were added later on to complete the line up in 2011.\n\nTaking from true origins of hip hop, blues, rock and roll, and funk music; KTA uses catchy, powerful, crowd chanting choruses that capture the voices of angst and civil unrest in the world. With new age poetic intellectual lyrics from frontman OB, KTA is taking worldwide atrocities and delivering them in a way that is original, unique, and comprehendible by all listeners. \n\nAs the KTA front man, Michael O\u2019Brien a.k.a \u201cOB\u201d quotes the music as \u201creal music for real people.\u201d OB began rapping 15 years ago, since which he has released three independent CD\u2019s as a self taught songwriter and producer. OB was the first hip hop act ever to play the renowned Northern Lights Festival and Summerfest music festivals in his hometown of Sudbury. Organizing demonstrations, rallies, and large group assemblies are some of OB\u2019s passions and pass-times. He regularly performs his hit single \u201cOne Day Longer\u201d amongst thousands of people from Sudbury, extending all the way to Mexico City, Mexico. As a third generation miner, OB has been recently named a \u201craptivist\u201d by community members for collaboration of his hip hop music and activism against global multinational corporations. \n==Discography==\n*''A New World Disorder'' (2011) (6.8.2.

The School was founded in 1946 and is a member of the [[Houston Area Independent Schools]], the Independent Schools Association of the Southwest (ISAS), and the [[Southwest Preparatory Conference]] (SPC).  Though situated adjacent to St. John the Divine church, St. John's claims no religious affiliation.  It has been coeducational since its founding and has produced many notable alumni. Noted for its selectivity and academic rigor, St. John's has been described by [[Forbes.com]] as one of \"America's Elite Prep Schools\" and listed by the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' as among schools in the United States with the largest percentages of graduates attending a handful of highly selective universities.\n\nSt. John's is a not-for-profit entity and receives no state or federal funding. Tuition for the 2015\u20132016 school year is $25,985 for Upper School students (grades 9 through 12), $24,525 for Middle School students (grades 6 through 8), and $21,675 for Lower School students (kindergarten through grade 5).<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.sjs.org\/Page\/Admission\/Tuition-Information |title=Tuition Information &#124; St. John's School |publisher=Sjs.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-14}}<\/ref> Many students receive partial to full need-based scholarships, as the School has a [[Need-blind|need-blind admissions policy]].<ref>[http:\/\/www.sjs.org\/page\/Admission\/Tuition-Information\/Affording-St-Johns]<\/ref>\n\nAs of June 2014, SJS's endowment is $71,554,760.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.sjs.org\/Page\/About\/SJS-Fast-Facts |title=SJS Fast Facts &#124; St. John's School |publisher=Sjs.org |date=2014-06-30 |accessdate=2015-05-20}}<\/ref>\n\n==History==\n===Founding===\nToward the close of [[World War II]], W. St. John Garwood and other prominent Houstonians sought to create in Houston a \"school of exacting standards\" in the development of individual, spiritual, ethical, intellectual, social, and physical growth of its students.  In January 1946, [[Alan Lake Chidsey]], former headmaster of both the Pawling School (today the [[Trinity-Pawling School]]) and the Arizona Desert School and the post-war Assistant Dean of Students at the [[University of Chicago]], was asked to fly to Texas to speak at a gathering of interested members of the Houston community.  Frontrunners of the idea, Mr. and Mrs. W. St. John Garwood, Sr., Mr. and Mrs. Merrick Phelps, Mr. R. E. Smith, Mr. J. O. Winston, Jr., and the Reverend Thomas Sumners of the Church of [[St. John the Divine]] [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] were among those present at the meeting.  At Mr. Chidsey's persuasion, Mrs. William S. Farish immediately committed to her involvement with the School, and many others followed.\n\nA proposal was drafted that entailed combining forces with the St. John the Divine nursery school to create the School. St. John's first 344 students filed into St. John the Divine's chapel on Opening Day, September 27, 1946. The entire campus, located on what used to be Michael Louis Westheimer's farm, was six acres (2.4 ha).\n\nToday, St. John's covers {{convert|28|acre|ha}} of land and educates 1,225 total students supported by over 200 faculty and staff. In late December 2012, the School purchased an additional 13 acres of adjacent land for approximately $90 million, resulting in its physical footprint increasing by approximately 33%.  Plans for the specific use of the additional property have not yet been announced.  Although the School's size has grown, the number of students per classroom remains small, and its student-teacher ratio is approximately 7:1. Despite its lack of religious affiliation, the School provides [[non-denominational]] chapel services at the church of St. John the Divine each Wednesday morning during the academic year. In recent years, the Chapel program has branched out to offer more multicultural services, hosting speakers from a diverse range of faiths and non-religious backgrounds, such as environmentalists, athletes, and faculty or student alumni.<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.sjs.org\/Page\/About\/History |title=History &#124; St. John's School |publisher=Sjs.org |date=1946-09-27 |accessdate=2015-05-20}}<\/ref>\n\n==Campus==\n[[Image:HoustonSt.John'sSchool.JPG|thumb|Mewbourne Hall, Cullen Campus, St. John's School]]\nSt. John's comprises two campuses, divided by Westheimer Road, that are connected by two pedestrian tunnels underneath Westheimer.  The Brown (South) Campus contains the Lower School (classes K-5) and the Georges Middle School (classes 6\u20138) as well as the Virginia Stuller Tatham (VST) Fine Arts Center and the Smith Athletic Center. The Cullen (North) Campus houses the Upper School (classes 9\u201312) and the focal point of the School, the Quadrangle. The Lower, Middle, and Upper Schools each maintain their own libraries. Upper and Middle School students share the Upper School cafeteria, and the Lower School has its own. Two tunnels run underneath Westheimer Road that connect the North and South Campuses. The school also maintains two athletic fields across West Alabama Street for field hockey, soccer, and lacrosse, and a baseball field adjacent to St. Luke's Methodist Church. In addition, the school's main field, Skip Lee Field, is located on the South Campus to the east of the Middle School and to the south of the Lower School. The school also owns two properties neighboring the South Campus that house athletic fields. Across West Alabama from the South Campus is the Scottland Yard property, the location of Finnegan Field and Scotty Caven Field. Across Buffalo Speedway from the South Campus is the Taub Property, a 13-acre property acquired by St. John's in December 2012. The school's baseball field along with temporary offices are located on the property as of March 2015.\n\nThe St. John's campus spans the [[Upper Kirby]] district and the residential neighborhood of [[River Oaks, Houston, Texas|River Oaks]]. In late 2014 the school released its master plan for the campus that included the recently acquired Taub Property. The plan was developed with the assistance of [[Architectural Resources Cambridge]] and the input of faculty, students, and alumni.<ref>{{cite web|title=Long-Range Campus Plan|url=http:\/\/www.sjs.org\/Page\/Campus-Expansion\/Long-Range-Campus-Plan|website=St. John's School|accessdate=8 March 2015}}<\/ref>\n\nThe school is adjacent to [[Lamar High School (Houston)|Lamar High School]], a public secondary school operated by [[Houston Independent School District]].\n\n==Academics==\n\n===Admission and college placement===\nData released by the School reflects that, from 2010 to 2014, approximately 48% of St. John's seniors went on to matriculate at colleges and universities ranked by [[U.S. News and World Report]] as being in the Top 25 of National Universities<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com\/best-colleges\/rankings\/national-universities\/data |title=National University &#124; Rankings &#124; Data &#124; US News |publisher=Colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-20}}<\/ref> and the Top 10 of Liberal Arts Colleges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com\/best-colleges\/rankings\/national-liberal-arts-colleges\/data |title=National Liberal Arts College &#124; Rankings &#124; Data &#124; US News |publisher=Colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-20}}<\/ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.sjs.org\/ftpimages\/80\/download\/download_1258258.pdf |format=PDF |title=St. John's School : Resume |publisher=Sjs.org |accessdate=2015-05-20}}<\/ref>\n\n===Curriculum===\nSt. John's Upper School students graduate having completed at least three course credits in mathematics, reached level III in a foreign language, amassed four course credits in English and writing, two course credits in laboratory science, three course credits in history and social studies, two years in physical education or sports (as of 2010), and one course credit in the arts (music, visual arts, theater, or dance).<ref>[http:\/\/www.sjs.org\/academics\/curriculum\/upper.asp ] {{wayback|url=http:\/\/www.sjs.org\/academics\/curriculum\/upper.asp |date=20071104113509 }}<\/ref>\n\n===Standardized testing===\n\nThe School's data for the SJS Class of 2015 reflects middle 50% SAT scores of 680-790 in Critical Reading, 700-790 in Math, and 690-790 in Writing.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"\/> \n\nFor years 2012 to 2015, more than half of each SJS senior class were recognized as National Merit Semifinalists or Commended Scholars: for 2012, the percentage was 68%; for 2013, 64%; for 2014, 59%; and for 2015, 64%.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"\/>  Data for the 2013-2014 academic year shows that SJS led all Houston-area schools in both number (49) and percentage (35%) of National Merit Semifinalists in its senior class.<ref name=\"houstonschoolsurvey1\">{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.houstonschoolsurvey.com\/national-merit-scholars.html#.VVIGuPlVhBc |title=National Merit Semi-Finalists in Houston - The Houston School Survey - School Research, Reviews, & Forum |publisher=The Houston School Survey |date=2014-09-29 |accessdate=2015-05-20}}<\/ref> [[Debakey High School]] had the second-highest number of National Merit Semifinalists in the Houston area (20), and [[Carnegie Vanguard High School]] had the third-highest percentage of National Merit Semifinalists in the area (15%).<ref name=\"houstonschoolsurvey1\"\/> The number of St. John's National Merit Semifinalists constituted 25% of all National Merit Semifinalists in the Houston area for 2013-2014.<ref name=\"houstonschoolsurvey1\"\/> \n\nSt. John's offers [[Advanced Placement]] courses in nearly every department, and many students take these college preparatory classes.

While House assignment is random, siblings are always assigned to the same House.  The Houses are: Chidsey, Winston, Hoodwink, Mulligan, Claremont, and Taub.\n\n===Athletics===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}\nSt. John's sponsors teams in cross-country, volleyball, field hockey, and football in the fall season; soccer, basketball, swimming, and wrestling in the winter; and golf, tennis, lacrosse, softball, baseball, and track and field in the spring.<ref>{{cite web|url=https:\/\/www.sjs.org\/Page\/Athletics\/Team-Pages |title=Team Pages &#124; St. John's School |publisher=Sjs.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-20}}<\/ref>\n\nIn a tradition that began in 1951, St. John's plays its annual homecoming football game against crosstown rival [[The Kinkaid School]] at [[Rice Stadium (Rice University)|Rice Stadium]].  Leading up to the contest is Kinkaid Week, which comprises traditions, activities, and pep rallies (including a whole-school pep rally that has featured helicopter fly-ins, motorcycle drive-throughs, and the like) designed to inspire school spirit for the game.\n\nSt. John's athletics has historically enjoyed success, especially in lacrosse and field hockey.  The lacrosse program at St. John's has long been successful, producing numerous All-American athletes at the collegiate level. In 2006, both the boys' and girls' lacrosse teams won the Texas High School Lacrosse League Championship.  In recent years, the varsity girls' field hockey team won the SPC Championship in 2008, 2011, 2012, and 2015.  Current and past SJS field hockey alumnae have gone on to play for varsity collegiate programs, four as captains, at [[Dartmouth College]], [[Brown University]], [[Kenyon College]], [[Yale University]], [[Stanford University]], [[Duke University]], [[Northwestern University]], [[Washington and Lee]], [[Colgate University]], [[Rutgers]], [[Tufts University]], [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], [[Harvard University]], [[Middlebury College|Middlebury]], [[Columbia University]], [[Davidson]], and [[Swarthmore College|Swarthmore]]. Twenty-nine field hockey players have been named High School Academic All-Americans since 2000.\n\nIn other sports, the girls' track and field teams won SPC championships in 2013, 2012, and 2010, and the girls' cross country team and the girls' volleyball team won SPC championships in 2009.\nBoys wrestling won back to back championships in 2012 and 2013. Boys basketball won back to back championships in 2010 and 2011 and won three in four years with a championship in 2013. After back to back second-place finishes in 2012 and 2013, the Boys Cross Country team won the 2014 SPC championship, their first championship since 2000.\n\nA variety of student organizations support the sports teams. The cheerleading program features three squads: 8th grade, junior varsity (9th and 10th grades), and varsity (11th and 12th grades). Drum Corps is a musical ensemble that provides spirited entertainment at sporting events, especially football games. Pots and Pans is a recently established group that lends their percussive talents to the sidelines and stands.\n\n===Arts===\nStudents can participate in the arts either in classes for academic credit, performing ensembles, or extracurricular organizations.\n\nIn Upper School, one fine arts credit is required for graduation. Though this technically can be fulfilled with an Independent Study Project, most if not all students opt to participate in performing ensembles or take classes during the academic day to complete their requirement. Visual art (including basic design, photography, painting and drawing, sculpture, and ceramics), theatre, art history, music theory, and more eclectic classes (such as the history of rock and roll) are offered.\n\nThe oldest extracurricular arts organization at St. John's is Johnnycake, founded by first headmaster Alan Lake Chidsey in 1949, that originally produced and performed works written by Mr. Chidsey. Open to all Upper School students, Johnnycake provides opportunities in all aspects of theatrical production from technical crew to set and costume design to performance. Once participants dedicate 100 hours of service to Johnnycake, they are eligible to become members of the [[International Thespian Society]]. Upon graduation, students may submit an essay to earn lifetime membership to Johnnycake. Johnnycake supports three main theatrical productions, two repertory plays and a musical, each year in the Upper School as well as other smaller student productions. Shortcake, the middle school division of Johnnycake, offers two to three production opportunities in the Middle School each year.<ref>\"[http:\/\/www.sjs.org\/podium\/default.aspx?t=111221] {{wayback|url=http:\/\/www.sjs.org\/podium\/default.aspx?t=111221 |date=20110719013857 }}<\/ref>\n\nStudents can participate in many choral groups. Any male student in 4th through 12th grade may participate in the Boy Choir in addition to their regular choral assignment. In grades 4 and 5, students may participate in the co-ed St. John's Singers. The highlight of the year for the St. John's Singers is the Spring Fling, the annual spring musical production. In Middle School, girls may participate in Cantatores. Upper schoolers have many options, from the all-women Les Chanteuses, mixed Chorale, and the selective chamber choir Kantorei.<ref>[http:\/\/www.sjs.org\/podium\/default.aspx?t=111222 ] {{wayback|url=http:\/\/www.sjs.org\/podium\/default.aspx?t=111222 |date=20110719013916 }}<\/ref> The Chapel Singers are a small volunteer choir that sings frequently at Upper School chapel services. Every other year, Kantorei travels on an international singing tour, with recent trips having been to Brazil, Canada, Austria, Italy (including a Mass in [[St. Peter's Basilica]]), Spain, and the Czech Republic.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nNo formal marching band exists at St. John's, but there are many musical ensembles and smaller bands. In Middle School, Beginner Band is open to class 7 and 8 students who are interested in learning to play a wind instrument. The Middle School Intermediate Band performs a repertoire ranging from standard band to pop and jazz. Students in intermediate band can also audition for the Middle School Jazz Band.  Students more adept at string instruments (violin, viola, cello, bass) can join the orchestral group, Sinfonietta.  The Upper School features both a Wind Ensemble and Jazz Band as well as the Chamber Strings. Sporting events are frequently cheered on by the Drum Corps.<ref>[http:\/\/www.sjs.org\/podium\/default.aspx?t=111223 ] {{wayback|url=http:\/\/www.sjs.org\/podium\/default.aspx?t=111223 |date=20110719013923 }}<\/ref>\n\nDance is also offered at St. John's. Beginning in sixth grade, students in the fine arts rotation take dance for one quarter, currently taught by Ms. Susan Sanders.  This continues until seventh grade, but in seventh grade, students may join the Impulse dance ensemble as an extracurricular involvement. In 8th grade, Impulse is offered as a course to fulfill the fine arts requirement. Upper School dance is a co-curricular course taken for credit. The program consists of five levels in ascending order: Caprice I, Caprice II, Caprice III, Caprice IV, and Terpsichore. An additional level, Caprice IV, was added for the 2009\u20132010 school year due to the number of dancers who auditioned. Just for fun, informal tap dance lessons are sponsored by Tap Club for Upper School students.\n\n===Student organizations===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}\nThe Review is the official student newspaper of St. John's School. Established by Headmaster Alan Lake Chidsey, it is one of the oldest student organizations on campus and is affiliated with the Columbia Scholastic Press Association. Although originally both students and teachers contributed to the publication, now it is an entirely student-driven organization. Unlike the student journalism program at many schools, participation on the newspaper does not earn academic credit. The Review publishes issues monthly, producing eight issues each year. In 2011, the Review launched the Review Online (blogs.sjs.org\/review), a website featuring news articles, photos and videos and began a Twitter feed, @SJS_Review.\n\nThe SJS Academic Bowl Team has been a successful quiz bowl team at local, state, and national levels. Also known as the Academic Team or Nerd Squad, the group competes in local, state, regional, and national tournaments of academic, intellectual, and sometimes esoteric topics related to anything from mathematics, science, the humanities, or \"trash\" (pop culture, sports, etcetera). The team often attends tournaments hosted by the Texas Quizbowl Alliance and other institutions. Most notably, it won the [[NAQT]] High School National Championship in 2002, placed third in 2003 and 2004, and advanced to the semi-finals of the PACE NSC in 2004. Most recently, St. John's placed 2nd in the 2014 HSNCT National Championships; moreover, star SJS player Carlo de Guzman helped the Texas All-Star team, coached by Dr. Chris Romero, capture the NASAT National Championships.\n\nDozens of other student organizations, from the Yearbook to Model United Nations to \"Pots and Pans\" (a moral\/spirit group), are active throughout the academic year. Most clubs are organized by students and sponsored by faculty. Almost any interest supported by a group of students can be organized into a club, subject to approval by the Dean of Students. Funds are often provided for club activities, examples being pizza lunches or science materials. Other examples of clubs include sports based clubs (baseball, hockey, soccer, curling), science (Science and Math Club, Faraday), cinematography (MavTV), academic (Quiz Bowl\/Academic Challenge, Mathematical Problem Solving Club), government (Junior Statesmen, Model UN), international interests (Spanish Club, Italian Club, International Club), and general interests (Auto club et al.). Interest and activity in clubs varies from year to year.\n\n===Community service===\nThough St. John's does not require community service hours for graduation, the student body boasts almost 100% student participation in community service projects.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} Service is encouraged by either participation in school-sponsored projects or individual participation in outside-of-school organizations. Many Upper School students receive awards both inside and out of school for their contributions to the community.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nCommunity service is first introduced in Lower School. Weekly canned food drives are held, and classes visit local food banks to see how their contributions are used.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} The annual drive to provide holiday presents to underprivileged families is a highlight of the year, culminating in a field trip to personally deliver the presents to the families.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} Many Lower School students choose to donate some of their art projects to Texas Children's Hospital each year.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nIn Middle School, additional community service projects are introduced. Students may be more involved in planning and helping with the organization of these projects. Each advisory may choose or designs a project to participate in as a group, and each grade completes one large project each year.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} In addition, there are many projects each month that all students are welcome to join. Examples of Middle School projects include volunteering at Special Olympics athletic events, organizing and dispensing toiletries for the homeless, participating in the annual Galveston Beach Clean-Up, and others.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} In Middle School and Upper School, personal service is promoted over monetary donations or drives.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}.\n\nUpper School community service is mostly student-driven.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} Any student may submit a proposal to design and lead their own project and recruit other participants. As a result, a wide variety of projects tailored to every interest develop, ranging from writing letters to troops stationed in Iraq to cleaning up trash from Galveston beach or Buffalo Bayou to escorting athletes at the Special Olympics.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} Students have worked with organizations including the [[Susan G. Komen]] [[Race for the Cure]], the Flower Foundation, the [[Buffalo Bayou]] Partnership, Texas Adopt-a-Beach, the [[Special Olympics]], [[Texas Children's Hospital]], the Seniors' Place, J.

Middle School girls may wear a red or plaid skirt with a white or black polo or a white oxford shirt or khaki shorts or pants with a white or black polo shirt. Upper School girls may wear a red or plaid skirt with a white or navy polo shirt or khaki shorts or pants with a white or navy polo shirt.\n\n===Nickname and mascot===\nThe St. John's nickname and [[mascot]] have had a controversial history.  The original nickname, \"Crusaders,\" lasted only three years due to its religious connotations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}  \"Rebels\" was selected as the replacement nickname in 1949, with [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] symbol ''[[Johnny Reb]]'' as the mascot.\n\nIn 1990, the Upper School students voted to discontinue the mascot and nickname.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}  A year later, all symbols of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] were disassociated from the School, although the nickname \"Rebels\" was retained with the hopes it could be connected with the [[American Revolution]] or more generally as an invocation of nonconformity and independent thinking.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nIn the spring of 2004, by a unanimous vote of the Board of Trustees, St. John's School officially changed its nickname to ''Mavericks'' in order to further distance itself from any Confederate implications while still retaining the association with independence and individualism.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} The change was supported by a majority of faculty, though some students and alumni opposed the change.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} Today, the Maverick nickname is widely used and accepted,{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} as most students who attended St. John's under the \"Rebel\" nickname have since graduated.\n\nIn 2008, St. John's began using a horse mascot known as Maverick in its pep rallies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.sjs.org\/ftpimages\/80\/download\/Graduation%20Issue%20for%20Online%20Final.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Review : Official Newsletter of St. John's School |date=2012 |publisher=Sjs.org |accessdate=2015-05-20}}<\/ref>\n\n==In the media and popular culture==\n\n===News Stories===\nNational media reports about selective private schools in the United States have mentioned St. John's.

Drawing of 1854.]]\nThe first Kempten station was built during the construction of the [[Ludwig South-North Railway]], opened on 1 April 1852 between [[Kaufbeuren]] and Kempten and extended on 1 May 1853 from Kempten to [[Immenstadt]]. As, on the one hand, it was desirable for the station to be as close to the city centre as possible, and on the other hand, a crossing of the deep [[Iller]] Valley at a reasonable cost was only possible at a narrow point one kilometre south of the city, it was decided to build a terminus,<ref>B\u00f6ttcher, ''Durchgangsbahnhof'', p. 327.<\/ref> used for both passengers and freight. In 1853, the station was equipped with a structure designated as the \"administration building\", a covered \u201chome\u201d platform, an entrance hall and a freight shed. The administration building had three full floors and a mezzanine, a low sloping roof supported by [[purlin]]s, reflecting the traditional architecture of the [[Alps|Alpine]] foothills.<ref>{{cite book| author= Manfred Berger |title= Historische Bahnhofsbauten |volume=  III: Bayern, Baden, W\u00fcrttemberg, Pfalz, Nassau Hessen |publisher=  Transpress |location= Berlin |year= 1988 | ISBN= 3-344-00267-8 |page= 31 |language=German}}<\/ref>  The \"unusual highly stilted building\" was typical of many commercial buildings from the early days of the [[industrial revolution]].\n\n[[File:Bahnhof Kempten 1888.jpg|thumb|left|Station building of the Kempten terminal station of 1888. The facade was made of brick.]]\nThe commissioning of the Iller Valley Railway to [[Neu-Ulm]] on 1 June 1863 and a substantial increase in traffic led to the first reconstructions of the platform and track facilities in 1869. Between 1885 and 1888 much of the station was rebuilt by the [[Royal Bavarian State Railways]]. On 9 November 1888, the [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance revival]] entrance building was opened with a spacious entrance hall, three waiting rooms and a room for royalty ({{lang-de|F\u00fcrstenzimmer}}). A luggage train connected the luggage office with the three platforms and five tracks. The wings of the entrance building, which had been part of the previous station building, were raised to three storeys, obscuring the perspective of the buildings from the station forecourt. The central building had two storeys.<ref>For specification see Berger, ''Bahnhofsbauten'', p. 31f.<\/ref>  The opening of the Au\u00dferfern Railway to [[Pfronten]] on 1 December 1895 and the line to [[Isny im Allg\u00e4u|Isny]] on 15 October 1909 led to further changes to the station.\n\nOn 1 July 1907, the Kempten bypass railway was opened, which relieved the terminal station of through traffic, especially freight trains. The bypass connected the lines from Neu-Ulm, Kaufbeuren and Pfronten directly to the Allg\u00e4u Railway to Immenstadt. A new bridge over the Iller was erected for the bypass; it is an arched bridge made of tamped concrete with a length of 155 metres and a main vault with a clearance of 64.5 metres, crossing the river at a height of 33 metres.<ref>B\u00f6ttcher, ''Durchgangsbahnhof'', p. 330. See also: {{structurae|id =s0012036|title =Illerbr\u00fccken Kempten| accessdate = 10 December 2011 }}<\/ref> North the bridge of the bypass line two more tamped concrete bridges were built on the access line to the terminal station. The wood truss bridge formerly used by the line was converted into a road bridge. A marshalling yard was built on the bypass line for the marshalling of freight trains from Bavaria and neighbouring countries in the northeast towards [[Lake Constance]], [[Switzerland]] and south western Europe; it had a capacity of 1,200 wagons per day. At the same time the engine depot was moved about two kilometres from the terminal station to the south of the marshalling yard. In 1933, the yard lost its national significance, because long-distance freight trains ran over the newly electrified [[Ulm\u2013Augsburg railway|Ulm\u2013Augsburg line]] and avoided the hilly Allg\u00e4u line.<ref>B\u00f6ttcher, ''Durchgangsbahnhof'', p. 328.<\/ref>\n\nFrom 1912, some \u201cD-trains\u201d ([[Schnellzug|D-Z\u00fcge]]: long-distance expresses) ran on the bypass line. All D-trains ran on the bypass line from the winter timetable of 1925\/26.<ref>Berger, ''Bahnhofsbauten'', p. 32.<\/ref> Instead of stopping at the Hauptbahnhof, trains stopped at Kempten-Hegge station, which was connected by shuttle trains, most recently [[railbus]]es, to the main station, 3.6&nbsp;km away.\n\nIn the 1960s, Kempten station handled about 10,000 daily passengers, of which 40% was through traffic, 20% represented transferring passengers and 40% was local traffic. Each day it was served by 200 passenger trains and 42 freight trains.<ref>For statistics see B\u00f6ttcher, ''Durchgangsbahnhof'', p. 328.<\/ref>\n\n===Through station of 1969 ===\nIn 1961, a fundamental reshaping of the Kempten railway facilities was approved. Feasibility studies showed that the construction of a new through station would cost twice as much as the required refurbishment of the existing station, but would result in a significant reduction in operating costs. The city of Kempten expected that the through station would improve the difficult traffic conditions of the inner city. The best location for the new station proved to be at the marshalling yard, approximately one kilometre south of the station. The access lines were able to follow the former route of the bypass railway. To make the project financially feasible, the line would use the bridge over the Iller used by the bypass.\n\nConstruction began in 1965. A total of 300,000 m\u00b3 earth was moved and 34 kilometres of track and 180 [[Railroad switch|sets of points]] were installed or re-laid.<ref>For statistics see B\u00f6ttcher, ''Durchgangsbahnhof'', p. 329f.<\/ref>  Under the original plan the passenger station would have had four platforms with seven platform tracks, but it was decided to dispense with the construction of a fourth platform for the time being, because of a decline in the volume of traffic. The station building was built west of the platforms and was planned to handle ticket sales of 1,500 and the clearance of 8.5 tons of luggage each day. The station building was built as a four-storey building with 14,000 cubic metres of enclosed space, including offices of [[Deutsche Bundesbahn]] (DB), equipment for rail operations and a restaurant with 85 seats. Particular importance was attached to the seven metre wide tunnel to the platforms, the first time that DB had installed as a common structure for the transport of luggage and passengers. The station forecourt was built with parking lots, bus stops and a taxi stand and connected by a grade-separated interchange with [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 19|federal highway 19]]. North of the square a new office building for [[Deutsche Bundespost]] was built. A [[Interlocking#Relay interlocking|relay interlocking]] was built south of the entrance building, replaced eleven old signal boxes.\n\nThe depot east of the passenger station was significantly reduced in scope after the switch from steam to diesel traction. The two [[roundhouse]]s with 45 stalls were demolished. In the late 1960s, the depot was the location of 95 diesel locomotives, including 20 railbuses and 20 shunting locomotives. In 1950, 55 steam locomotives had been located in Kempten. The traction change meant that the number of employees in the depot dropped from 269 to 170.<ref>For statistics see B\u00f6ttcher, ''Durchgangsbahnhof'', p. 337.<\/ref>\n\nThe total cost in 1972 of the remodelling of the station was [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] 39.7 million.<ref>For statistics see B\u00f6ttcher, ''Durchgangsbahnhof'', p. 329.<\/ref>\n\nThe old terminal station was demolished; Kempten-Hegge station was also closed after the commissioning of the new station. An educational complex, a shopping centre (''Forum Allg\u00e4u'') and an events hall (''BigBOX Allg\u00e4u'') were established in the former station area. The Iller bridge on the station approach was converted into a road bridge and the earlier wooden bridge which had been converted to a road bridge was converted again for cyclists and pedestrians.\n\n==Infrastructure==\nSeveral bus routes to downtown and the surrounding communities operate from the bus stop in the station forecourt. The station building was renovated and modernised in 2008. It has three ticket offices and five ticket machines. Likewise, several shops have been established in the side rooms. The main entrance is from the west, where there are also bus and taxi connections. There are also parking facilities. East of the platforms are long-term parking spaces, from which there is direct access is possible to the platform by subway.\n\nThe tracks of Kempten station are typically used as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

However, the season included Georgia fourth straight loss to [[1907 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team|Georgia Tech]]. One of the players on the 1907 team was [[quarterback]] [[George Cecil Woodruff|George \"Kid\" Woodruff]], who would become Georgia's head football coach in 1923.\n\nThe team started the season under the guidance of head coach Bull Whitney, but the season became marred by the \"Ringer\" controversy. At that time, there were no football scholarships, but enthusiastic alumni often raised money to pay professional players who were referred to as \"ringers.\" After the 1907 game with Georgia Tech, it was revealed that there were at least four ringers on the Georgia and Georgia Tech teams. Thereafter, Georgia completed the season without its ringers and without Bull Whitney, who was forced to resign.

One more possible little bit is from Professor George Reisch who writes in ''Pink Floyd and Philosophy: Careful with that Axiom, Eugene!'' that Barrett \"styled himself a 'Piper at the Gates of Dawn' \" (page 189.)

It is not currently used as a reference. Palacios researched deeply into Barrett's world for ten years before publishing the book. Regarding this album, Palacios writes that Pete Bown had more of a producer's role in shaping the album. Bown was senior to Norman Smith\u2014had mentored him\u2014and employed his experienced ear in experimenting with equipment and novel techniques so that the album would sound unique. Palacios writes that Barrett's voice was quiet so they put him in a vocal isolation booth with headphones to lay down his vocals, but that the instruments were recorded together in the main studio, with the musicians facing each other. Microphone choices and placement were mostly Bown's, with little similarity to Smith's previous sessions.<\/s> \n::Half {{done}} [[User:Yeepsi|yeepsi]] <small>([[User talk: Yeepsi|Time for a chat?]])<\/small> 19:43, 24 December 2012 (UTC)\n:::Reminder for self: <s>p.187.<\/s> [[User:Yeepsi|yeepsi]] <small>([[User talk: Yeepsi|Time for a chat?]])<\/small> 19:55, 24 December 2012 (UTC)\n::::.212 [[User:Yeepsi|yeepsi]] <small>([[User talk: Yeepsi|Time for a chat?]])<\/small> 01:35, 25 December 2012 (UTC)\n:::::{{done}} [[User:Yeepsi|yeepsi]] <small>([[User talk: Yeepsi|Time for a chat?]])<\/small> 22:08, 25 December 2012 (UTC)\n*<s>Palacios quotes Beatles biographer Kevin Ryan (''[[Recording the Beatles]]'') in telling the reader that ''Piper'' uses [[artificial double tracking]] extensively on various instruments, not just vocals, adding to the extreme reverberation\/echo style which is characteristic of the album, achieved primarily with [[Elektro-Mess-Technik]] (EMT) plate reverbs and the [[echo chamber]]s of Abbey Roads.

Some say it is the only good Floyd album because Barrett was the essential ingredient, others say it is simply a very fine start to the band's career which did not need Barrett to continue. A bit about this dichotomy ought to be in the article. (Cavanagh, p. 122)\n*<s>'''LSD''': The influence of LSD on Barrett is widely discussed. Shouldn't LSD be mentioned in this article? Nine days before beginning to record the album, the band was said to be making music for acid takers: \"The Pink Floyd group specialise in 'psychedelic music', which is designed to illustrate LSD experiences.\" \u2014\"Pop songs and the cult of LSD\", from the tabloid ''News of the World''. (Cavanagh, p. 42) Writer Laura S. Jeffrey in ''Pink Floyd: The Rock Band'' says that Barrett escalated his LSD intake in the spring of 1967, during the writing and recording of this album, such that by June he was visibly debilitated. Writers Ray Broadus Browne and Pat Browne say in ''The guide to United States popular culture'' that Barrett was \"the only real drug user in the band\" ([http:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=U3rJxPYT32MC&pg=PA610 page 610]). The album is hailed not only as a psychedelic masterpiece but LSD is named as a direct influence. (Bruno MacDonald, ''Pink Floyd: Through the eyes of... the Band, Its Fans, Friends, and Foes'', [http:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=b7J3K2snuhAC&pg=PA11 page 11].) Arved Mark Ashby can be quoted from his book ''The Pleasure of Modernist Music: Listening, Meaning, Intention, Ideology'' ([http:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=Pit6yL_Few4C&pg=PA292 pages 291\u2013292]) in which he says that Barrett's LSD taking, even though it was not the most important musical influence in his life, seems to have had an effect on the \"spacey\" quality of the long jams.<\/s>\n::I'm also unsure under which section to put the LSD info. [[User:Yeepsi|yeepsi]] <small>([[User talk: Yeepsi|Time for a chat?]])<\/small> 23:28, 25 December 2012 (UTC) \n:::Well, maybe it should be split in two or three. The first mention of LSD could go in \"Background\". You could tell the reader that Barrett (but not the rest of Pink Floyd) was known for taking LSD. You could say that the band had a tabloid reputation for making music for LSD takers. Later, in the \"Recording\" section, you could say that Barrett's LSD intake increased. Finally, in the \"Release\" section, you could say that Barrett looked like hell in June. Alternatively, you might include this last bit in the \"Recording\" section.

Beatles biographer Philip Norman agrees that ''Piper'' is a concept album (''John Lennon: The Life'', [http:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=vT2XTUfPvl4C&pg=PA498 page 498].) Other authors wait to name as concept albums the Floyd works ''Dark Side'' and ''The Wall''. For instance, Professor George Reisch writes in ''Pink Floyd and Philosophy: Careful with that Axiom, Eugene!'' that Pink Floyd are the \"undisputed\" kings of the concept album, starting from 1973's ''Dark Side of the Moon'', which means he does not consider ''Piper'' to be a concept album.

A [[child prodigy]], he grew up in [[Warsaw]], but left Poland, never to return, aged 20. He settled in Paris and in 1835 he obtained French citizenship. From 1837 he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer [[George Sand]]. A brief and unhappy visit to [[Majorca]] with her was one of his most productive periods of composition. Through most of his life, Chopin suffered from poor health. He died in Paris in 1849, probably of [[tuberculosis]]. All of Chopin's compositions include the piano, amongst them [[mazurka]]s, [[waltz]]es, [[nocturne]]s, [[polonaise]]s, [[\u00e9tude]]s, [[impromptu]]s, [[scherzo]]s, and [[prelude (music)|prelude]]s; many contain elements of Polish [[folk music]]. Chopin\u2019s combination of transcendent keyboard technique and poetic genius were the foundations of his European reputation, despite giving only 30 or so recitals after he left his homeland. His music, his status as one of music's earliest \"superstars\", his association with political insurrection, his love life and his early death have made him a leading symbol of his era. {{TFAFULL|Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin}}\n<\/div>\n* [[WP:TFAREC|Most recent similar article(s)]]: last composer bio 10 June Frederick Delius, last classical music 1 July Pierre Monteux, - possibly 21 September Gustav Holst\n* Main editors: [[User:Smerus|Smerus]]\n* Promoted: 2014\n* Reasons for nomination: 165th anniversary of death, vital article\n* '''Support''' as nominator.

From his early eclectic styling he has developed into an idiosyncratic theorist.\n\nTigerman's building credits as principal designer include institutional projects such as The Five Polytechnic Institutes in Bangladesh, [[Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center|The Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center in Skokie]], The [[Illinois Regional Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped in Chicago]], and The [[POWERHOUSE Energy Museum]] in [[Zion, Illinois]]. He has completed both mixed use high rise and low rise housing projects throughout the United States, as well as in [[Germany]] and [[Japan]], and he has designed exhibition installations for museums in the United States, [[Portugal]] and [[Puerto Rico]]. He worked in [[Bangladesh]] with [[Louis I Kahn]] and [[Muzharul Islam]]. His broad range of collaborative works include The Chicago Central Area Plan, the [[1992 Chicago World's Fair]], and London's Kings' Cross and St. Pancras' High Density Mixed Use Urban Plan. From the more than 390 projects defining his career, over 175 built works embrace virtually every building type.\n\nTigerman also designed one residential building.  Originally known as the Boardwalk Apartments, the building is located at the southeast corner of Montrose and Clarendon Avenue, it was completed in 1974.  By 1980, the property had been converted to a condominium, as it remains today.\n\nTigerman is the former Director of the School of Architecture at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]]. In 1994, Tigerman co-founded [[Archeworks]], a nonprofit organization in Chicago, with designer Eva L. Maddox.\n\n==Personal life==\nTigerman has been married three times. He has a son and daughter from his first marriage. His third wife, a [[Presbyterian]], is fellow architect and partner, Margaret McCurry.<ref name=ChiReader \/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Chicago Seven (architects)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n* Robert A.

We have a number of individual studies, but are there longer term assessments out there? If we have one for anorgasmia we can probably fold that into the discussion of Struck and Ventegodt.

Lastly, please note that if the article does get deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these admins]] to request that a copy be emailed to you. <!-- Template:Db-spam-notice --> <!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --> [[User:Ravenswing|'''<span style=\"background:Blue;color:Cyan\"> &nbsp;Ravenswing&nbsp;<\/span>''']] 21:55, 19 June 2008 (UTC)\n\nHi, I saw you added a <nowiki>{{hangon}}<\/nowiki> tag to this article.

If you do, you will need to show how the company is [[WP:NOTE|notable]] per the [[WP:CORP|guidelines for company notability]].

I still have your page on my watchlist as a result of the username issue so happened to note that you had left a question here. It's generally a good idea to put new comments at the bottom of a page or section, so they will be visible. When you put them at the top, they are likely to be overlooked. It's also unusual that somebody will notice a question you place on your own talk page. If you want to draw assistance here, you can type a question and then put {{tl|help me}} next to it (brackets included). Alternatively, you can always ask for assistance at [[WP:HD|the help desk]], which is typically manned around the clock by volunteers. Please remember when you write on talk pages or discussion boards like the help desk to sign your note with four [[tilde]]s. This is good practice even on your own talk page, as it will help other editors to see where your comment ends and the next begins and also clarify when a note was left (as well as by whom).\n\nOn the specifics of your question, I've left some suggestions for sourcing clarification at the talk of the article, [[Talk:Burges Salmon|here]]. Adding sources to verify those particular claims would go a long way to helping address the question of neutrality. If those issues are satisfactorily addressed, I would feel comfortable removing the COI tag from the article. Please note that sources for such claims need to be independent of the subject and so cannot come from the company's website. Sources related to the company (including press releases) may be used to add details about the company, but not to verify matters related to its notability. --[[User:Moonriddengirl|Moonriddengirl]] <sup>[[User talk:Moonriddengirl|(talk)]]<\/sup> 15:14, 25 June 2008 (UTC)\n\n==AfD nomination of Burges Salmon==\n<div class=\"floatleft\" style=\"margin-bottom:0\">[[File:Ambox warning pn.svg|42px]]<\/div>An article that you have been involved in editing, [[Burges Salmon]], has been listed for [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|deletion]].

After substantial modifications in 1970-71, that layout remained the same through the end of the Grand Prix era.\n\nThe one significant difference from the present day is that there was no chicane (known nowadays as the \"inner loop\" and numbered \"turn 5\") at the end of the front straight. The chicane was added in the 1980s after a driver was killed when he went straight on at the end of the front straight, the highest speed section of the track.\n\nDuring the Grand Prix years, the curve at the end of the front straight and the short downhill straight leading to the next curve after it were known collectively as the \"loop and chute\".\n\nThe reason I mention this is that the number of turns during the Grand Prix years was 11, not 12, because the \"inner loop\" did not exist yet.\n\n[[User:Cjngraphic|Cjngraphic]] ([[User talk:Cjngraphic|talk]]) 22:47, 24 June 2008 (UTC)","timestamp":"20160410103733","user-timestamp":"20150410103733"},{"title":"Talk:Blesmes","content":"{{WikiProject France|class=Stub|importance=Low|commune=yes}}","timestamp":"20160410103734","user-timestamp":"20150410103734"},{"title":"Talk:Bankura Sadar subdivision","content":"{{WP India\n|class=start\n|importance=low\n|geography=yes\n|geography-importance=mid\n|bengal=yes\n|bengal-importance=mid\n}}","timestamp":"20160410103734","user-timestamp":"20150410103734"},{"title":"User talk:209.250.173.159","content":"\n\n== October 2012 ==\n[[Image:Information.svg|left|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia.

Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time.

In keeping with Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]] policy, edits where there is a conflict of interest, or where such a conflict might reasonably be inferred from the tone of the edit and the proximity of the editor to the subject, are strongly discouraged. If you have a conflict of interest, you should '''avoid''' or '''exercise great caution''' when:\n#'''editing''' or '''creating''' articles related to you, your organization, or its competitors, as well as projects and products they are involved with;\n#'''participating''' in [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Deletion_processes|deletion discussions]] about articles related to your organization or its competitors;\n# '''linking''' to the Wikipedia article or website of your organization in other articles (see [[Wikipedia:Spam]]); and,\n# '''avoid breaching''' relevant policies and guidelines, especially those pertaining to [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]], [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiability of information]], and [[Wikipedia:Autobiography|autobiographies]].\n\nFor information on how to contribute to Wikipedia when you have conflict of interest, please see [[Wikipedia:FAQ\/Organizations|our frequently asked questions for organizations]].

This applies to articles about you, your achievements, your band, your business, your publications, your website, your relatives, and any other possible [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]]. \n\nCreating an [[Wikipedia:Autobiography|article about yourself]] is ''strongly'' discouraged. If you create such an article, it might be listed on [[wikipedia:articles for deletion|articles for deletion]]. Deletion is not certain, but many feel strongly that you should not ''start'' articles about yourself. This is because independent creation encourages independent validation of both significance and verifiability. All edits to articles must conform to [[Wikipedia:No original research]], [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view]], and [[Wikipedia:Verifiability]]. \n\nIf you are not [[WP:notability|\"notable\"]] under Wikipedia guidelines, creating an article about yourself may violate the policy that [[Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_blog.2C_webspace_provider.2C_social_networking.2C_or_memorial_site|Wikipedia is not a personal webspace provider]] and would thus qualify for [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#a7|speedy deletion]].

He attempted a comeback as the candidate of the ruling [[Concertaci\u00f3n]] coalition for the [[Chilean presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential election]], but was narrowly defeated.  His father was [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]] who was President of Chile from 1964 to 1970.\n\n==Biography==\nFrei was born in [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]] to [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]] and Mar\u00eda Ruiz-Tagle Jim\u00e9nez. He received all his schooling at the Luis Campino Institute. He then attended the [[University of Chile]], where he graduated as a Civil Engineer, specializing in [[hydraulics]].

In 1958, he joined the [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|Christian Democrat]] party, and in 1964 participated actively in his father's successful presidential campaign. Between 1969 and 1988 he concentrated on his profession, as one of the partners of [[Sigdo Koppers]] S.A., the largest engineering company in Chile.\n\nIn 1988 Frei founded and promoted the ''Comit\u00e9 Pro Elecciones Libres'' (\"Committee for the promotion of free elections\"). In 1989 he was elected Senator for Santiago, obtaining the highest amount of votes in the whole country. In the Senate, he presided over the Treasury and Budget commission, and was a member of the Housing commission.\n\nIn 1992 Frei participated in the primary presidential elections of his coalition, where he defeated [[Ricardo Lagos]], and then went on to win the presidential elections in 1993. He took office on March 11, 1994 and was succeeded by Lagos in 2000. Frei\u2019s presidency was notable in making improvements in health and education, together with reducing poverty.<ref>http:\/\/www.clubmadrid.org\/en\/miembro\/eduardo_frei_ruiz_tagle><\/ref> Following the end of his presidency, Frei assumed, as a former President, a seat as [[senator for life|senator-for-life]] in Congress. Given that Constitutional reforms in 2005 abolished life senators starting in 2006, Frei ran for an elected Senate seat in the [[Chilean parliamentary election, 2005|December 2005 parliamentary elections]] and was victorious. He was elected in the electoral district of [[Valdivia Province]] and [[Osorno Province]] together with [[Andr\u00e9s Allamand]]. On March 11, 2006 Frei became President of the Senate, like his father, who was also President of the Senate after being President of the Republic.\n\nIn [[Chilean presidential election, 2009-2010|2009-2010 elections]], Frei ran for the presidency of Chile for a second time, again as the candidate of the centre-left [[Concertaci\u00f3n]]  center-coalition, promising continuity of the popular outgoing President [[Michelle Bachelet]]'s path.<ref>{{cite news |url=http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/idUSN0922773120091209?type=swissMktRpt |work=Reuters |title=PREVIEW-Chile right seen ousting left in first since Pinochet |date=2009-12-09}}<\/ref> Some of his presidential campaign banners and billboards pictured him accompanied by Michelle Bachelet over his left shoulder.

Since neither candidate received more than half of the total votes, a run-off election was held on Sunday, January 17, 2010.

It was used for a brief two-week period by the [[Twelfth Air Force]] [[86th Bombardment Group]], flying [[A-20 Havoc]]s from the field in early and mid-June 1943 during the [[North African Campaign]].

This disease is a progressive one, and as long as the child is left in the stressing environment, his or her cognitive abilities continue to degenerate. Though rare in the population at large, it is common in [[feral children]] and in children kept in abusive, confined conditions for extended lengths of time. It can cause the body to completely stop growing but is generally considered to be temporary; regular growth will resume when the source of stress is removed.\n\n==Etiology==\nChildren with PSS have extremely low levels of [[growth hormone]].  These children possibly have a problem with [[somatostatin|growth hormone inhibiting hormone]] (GHIH) or [[growth hormone releasing hormone]] (GHRH). The children could either be unresponsive to GHRH, or too sensitive to GHIH.\n\nChildren who have PSS exhibit signs of [[failure to thrive]]. Even though they appear to be receiving adequate [[nutrition]], they do not grow and develop normally compared to other children of their age.\n\nAn environment of constant and extreme stress causes PSS. Stress releases hormones in the body such as [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]] engage what is known as the 'fight or flight' response. The heart speeds up and the body diverts resources away from processes that are not immediately important; in PSS, the production of growth hormone (GH) is thus affected.  As well as lacking growth hormone, children with PSS exhibit [[gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] problems due to the large amounts of epinephrine and norepinephrine, resulting in their bodies lacking proper digestion of nutrients and further affecting development.\n\nWhile the cure for PSS is questionable, some studies show that placing the child affected with the disease in a foster or group home increases growth rate and socialization skills.\n\n==Cases==\n<!--- Before adding J.M. Barrie as an example, please see the Talk page: that supposed case has been discredited--->\n\nOne case was a child who was admitted to a hospital with an extremely low weight. One nurse took over his care and he began to rapidly gain weight and his growth hormone levels increased during this time. The child was so dependent on the nurse emotionally that when she left, his levels returned to what they had been when he was admitted to the hospital, and once she returned, they stabilized once more.<ref name=sapolsky>{{cite book\n |last= Sapolsky |first= Robert M. \n |title= Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers: An Updated Guide to Stress, Stress-Related Diseases, and Coping\n |location= New York\n |publisher= W.H.

The structure is prominent among other [[Neoclassical architecture]] in Ponce because it is the first structure in Ponce built in that architectural style for use as a residence but then subsequently used as the headquarters of a prominent community-based civic organization, the Centro Espa\u00f1ol de Ponce club.\n\n==Location==\nThe structure is located in Ponce, Puerto Rico, on the northwest corner of Villa and Mendez Vigo streets.\n\n==History==\nThe house was designed in 1911 by Ponce architect Eduardo Salich. It was built for [[Don (honorific)|Don]] Fernando Manuel Toro and his wife [[Do\u00f1a]] Adela Cortada. The family occupied the house for several generations. On 17 November 1961, the building became the headquarters for the Centro Espa\u00f1ol de Ponce, a prominent civic organization working for the preservation of Spanish heritage in the city. Many distinguished Ponce citizens have been associated with Centro Espa\u00f1ol. Ponce architect [[Francisco Porrata Doria]] (1890\u20131971) once presided over the club headquartered at the structure on Villa and Mendez Vigo streets.<ref>[http:\/\/web.me.com\/jamarimutt\/fpd\/Rese%C3%B1a_biogr%C3%A1fica.html ''Francisco L.

Its founders were a group of Spanish residents of the city of Ponce. Most prominent among its founders were Francisco Oliver Culvelje, Bartolome Arbona, Jacinto Arbona, and Pedro Gispert, but the total group of founders included some 20 other local Spanish residents. The purpose of the organization was to preserve the Spanish heritage in Ponce.  The first meeting place was at Number 10 on what is now the perimeter of [[Plaza Las Delicias]]. The club\u2019s first board of directors included such prominent Ponce residents as Bernardo Valdecilla, Pedro Juan Bonnin, Manuel Gandara, Antonio Vicens, Francisco Font, and Bartolome Melia.<ref name=\"Janeiro\">Luis Fortu\u00f1o Janeiro.

My name is Backslash Forwardslash. I am a Wikipedia administrator, and I noticed you have recently created a userpage. I don't intend to scare you away or attempt to intimidate you, but I thought you might want to reconsider some of the items on your userpage. You may have not realised that the items on your userpage release [[Personally identifiable information|personal information]] about yourself (real name or age etc), which could be used against you in the future. While 99% of all the editors on Wikipedia are friendly, welcoming and harmless, there is a chance your personal information could be misused by editors not so 'high-minded'. A handful of editors have even felt [[Wikipedia:Harassment#Off-wiki_harassment|real-world implications]] due to their Wikipedia edits and release of personal information. \n\nProtecting [[Internet privacy|your privacy]], and remaining anonymous while on the internet \u2014 on any site \u2014 is a good idea. The internet is a worldwide and largely unregulated medium, and while Wikipedia is one of the safer sites, there are definite risks while online. With [[cyber-bullying]] and [[cyberstalking]] becoming increasingly commonplace, it is important that you take every precaution to remain [[Digital safety|safe]].\n\nI have deleted some revisions of your userpage in respect to your privacy for the time being, just in case you wish to reverse on your decision to have such content on public display. As a result, the information is only available to [[WP:ADMIN|administrators]]. You are, of course, welcome to ask myself or another administrator to restore them, but I just wanted to make you aware of the risks involved with releasing personal information on such a public forum. If you wish to have the personal information removed so that even administrators cannot view it, I can request [[WP:OVERSIGHT|oversight]] on your behalf. You are also welcome to discuss this with me on [[User Talk:Backslash Forwardslash|my talk page]], or privately via [[Special:EmailUser\/Backslash Forwardslash|e-mail]] if you have any concerns. Again, I do not want to scare you. Wikipedia is a fantastic place with an incredibly supportive community. I'm just trying to ensure you are fully aware of the risks involved in editing, which are very similar to the risks you come across every day online. Hope to hear from you. \\ [[User:Backslash Forwardslash|Backslash Forwardslash]] \/ {[[User Talk: Backslash Forwardslash|talk]]} 22:01, 16 July 2009 (UTC)\n<!-- Comment generated from {{subst:User:Backslash Forwardslash\/Userpageedited}} -->","timestamp":"20160410103839","user-timestamp":"20150410103839"},{"title":"User talk:Dust21","content":"\n\n== Welcome ==\n'''Welcome!'''\n\nHello, {{BASEPAGENAME}}, and [[Wikipedia:Introduction|welcome]] to Wikipedia!

I did some cleaning up in '''Historical''' and '''Current''' subsections, just to make dash use in there consistent and user-friendly in terms of legibility.\n\nMost of this is a good part from my own point of view and a good part from the [[Dash]] article.\n\n*I didn't touch on bus models, as they use the hyphen-minus anyway;\n*Years in the form of \"from xxxx ''to'' xxxx\" and \"xxxx ''to'' present\" look like this: 1968&#8211;1974 and \"1996&#8211;present\";\n*Years in the form of \"from late 1980s ''to'' mid 1990s\" are given an unspaced em dash: \"late 1980s&#8212;mid 1990s\", since the ''from'' and ''to'' statements are not mere numbers, but contain two (or more) word constructs (I don't mind if someone disputes this statement in favour of an en dash);\n*Parenthetical statements, such as \"F40LF \u2014 Fuel Cell (Hydrogen) Test Buses (1996)\" are separated with a spaced em dash. While indeed in [[American English]] usage, spaced em dashes are not used, I still feel it is warranted in here, so as to separate bus model numbers from the rest of the text and not make it appear as part of the model number itself;\n*For consistency in sections with the above point, parenthetical statements are also separated with a spaced em dash.\n\nDespite my own cleanups, there is still an overabundance of parentheses.\n<br>-[[User:Mardus|Mardus]] 01:05, 22 October 2006 (UTC)\n\nThis has been eliminated, with all models now in a table, as the [[Motor Coach Industries]] article has it, with both US and metric units given.--[[User:AEMoreira042281|AEMoreira042281]] ([[User talk:AEMoreira042281|talk]]) 15:52, 19 January 2008 (UTC)\n\n== Removed client list ==\n\nI've removed the client list from the article on the basis that it doesn't add anything to the article.

Later along the path, the tornado narrowed to around {{convert|60|yd|ft|}} wide as it tore through Sherman. Fifty homes were destroyed in town, 20 of which were completely obliterated and swept away. An iron-beam bridge was torn from its supports and twisted into multiple pieces, and one of the beams was driven several feet into the ground.<ref name=\"F5\">{{Cite book| last=Grazulis|first=Thomas P.|authorlink=Thomas P.

Trees were completely debarked along the path as well, with even small twigs stripped bare in some cases. Homes were swept away in Thomas, including one that was obliterated with the debris scattered up to 10 miles away. A piano from that residence was found 200 yards away from the foundation, with one end \"pounded full of grass\".

By 1857, six families were living in the vicinity.  Descendants of the original founders still reside in the community.  In 1859, the settlers organized the Evangelical Emmanuel Church and by 1867 the members had collected enough funds to construct a stone church on land donated by Jacob Hildenbrand for that purpose and a cemetery.  Until 1908, the sermons were preached in [[German language|German]].<ref name=clintonlake \/>\n\n===20th century===\nThe Stull Church of Christ was started in 1907, and by 1913 a frame church was built in town.

How were we supposed to believe in a planet which had several times achieved intelligent life but didn't know even the concept of darkness?  Which means their very first habitations, of course needed in inclement weather let alone cold\/wet seasons, must have been made of glass?  So they discovered how to make glass as soon as they were able to manage fire?  Oh, OK, their six suns meant they never had seasons.\n\nBut each time an intelligent life form developed, it never thought to explore inside any cave or pothole?  And they'd reached highly advanced stages without ever needing to sink mineshafts.  So they didn't understand the notion of a lamp?\n\nI can't be the only person who realized these things as soon as finishing reading the story, so it's a puzzle to me how it's consistently said to be the greatest scifi work ever, or some such.  I loved Azimov's stories when I was young, particularly the Foundation series.  But how can it be said that Nightfall is the greatest ever when it's built on such a non-credible situation? [[User:L0ngpar1sh|L0ngpar1sh]] ([[User talk:L0ngpar1sh|talk]]) 21:10, 21 December 2010 (UTC)\n\n:When the short story was originally published, the physics of multistar systems of order six were not yet understood. Planetary formation theories was drawn from a sample of 1 (the Solar System) And habitability of planets is still not really understood. We now know they are tiered binary systems. And the physics of the situation only need to exist for a few cycles, long enough for the people to not know about a past where there was a night, or a visible moon, and for several eclipse periods to have happened. It doesn't need to have existed any longer than that. Before that period, there could have been a visible moon and night. And in the far future of the world, there could be again. -- [[Special:Contributions\/65.94.169.222|65.94.169.222]] ([[User talk:65.94.169.222|talk]]) 11:27, 27 July 2014 (UTC)\n\n{{collapse bottom}}\n\n== Planet's and stars' name ==\n\n\"[[Lagash]]\" is a well-known Middle East archaeological site (according to the En.

He began singing from the age of 6 in church and school [[choir]]s, and was given the nickname \"D-Train\" during his studies at [[Erasmus Hall High School]], due to his powerful [[Defensive_tackle#Defensive_tackle|defensive tackle]] in the [[American football|football]] team. It was at Erasmus that Williams' classmate, future [[record producer]] [[Will Downing]], introduced him to [[keyboardist]] [[Hubert Eaves III]] with whom he performed. After Eaves' stint in [[Mtume]] during the 1970s, he and Williams would come together again in 1980 to form [[D-Train]], named after Williams' own nickname.<ref>http:\/\/www.jamesdtrainwilliams.com\/bio.html<\/ref>\n\n===D-Train===\n{{Main|D-Train}}\nD-Train released their first single, \"[[You're the One for Me (D.

It was founded in 1950 by [[Jac Holzman]], and played an important role in the development of [[contemporary folk music]] and [[rock music]] between the 1950s and 1970s.  In 2004, it was consolidated into WMG's [[Atlantic Records Group]]. After five years of dormancy, the label was revived as an imprint of Atlantic in 2009, and is now run by [[Jeff Castelaz]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings===\nElektra was formed in 1950 by [[Jac Holzman]] and Paul Rickolt in Holzman's [[St. John's College (Annapolis\/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] dorm room.<ref name=\"npr-1\">{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.npr.org\/templates\/story\/story.php?storyId=4954635|title=Warner Music Struggles to Restore Its Luster|date=11 October 2005|work=NPR.org|accessdate=9 March 2015}}<\/ref> Each invested $300. The usual spelling of the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] [[Pleiades (Greek mythology)|Pleiad]] [[Electra (Pleiad)|Electra]]<ref name=\"FTM_6\">Follow the Music p6<\/ref> was changed. Holzman famously explained, \u201cI gave her the \u2018K\u2019 that I lacked\u201d. He found the 'C' in the original name \"too soft\" but liked the \"solid bite\" of the letter 'K', citing its use in the [[Kodak]] name.<ref name=\"FTM_6\"\/><ref>\u0397\u03bb\u03ad\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 in the original Greek.<\/ref>\n\nThe first Elektra LP, ''New Songs'' (EKLP 1 released March 1951), was a collection of [[Lieder]] and similar art songs, which sold few copies. During the Fifties and early Sixties, the label concentrated on [[folk music]] recordings, releasing a number of best-selling albums by [[Theodore Bikel]], [[Ed McCurdy]], [[Oscar Brand]], [[Judy Collins]], and [[protest song|protest singers]] such as [[Phil Ochs]] and [[Tom Paxton]]. Holzman also recorded [[Josh White]], who was without a record deal as a result of [[HUAC|McCarthyite blacklisting]].\n\nIn 1964, Elektra launched [[Nonesuch Records]]. This classical budget label was the best-selling budget classical label of the era. Other labels followed suit by starting their own budget series, but Nonesuch remained the most popular and Jac Holzman states in his book that profits from the budget classical label made it possible for Elektra to experiment with their pop releases by the mid-sixties.\n\nIn 1965, Elektra began a short-lived joint venture with Survey Music called Bounty Records which was Elektra's first foray into pop music.<ref>{{Cite journal | url = https:\/\/books.google.com\/?id=HCkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA30&dq=%22bounty+records%22+%2B+elektra#v=onepage&q=%22bounty%20records%22%20%2B%20elektra&f=false | title = Billboard | author1 = Nielsen Business Media | first1 = Inc | date = 1965-09-25}}<\/ref> The most notable signing for Bounty was the [[Paul Butterfield]] Band who was moved over to Elektra when Bounty folded.<ref>{{Cite journal | url = https:\/\/books.google.com\/?id=TykEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA16&dq=%22bounty+records%22+%2B+elektra#v=onepage&q=%22bounty%20records%22%20%2B%20elektra&f=false | title = Billboard | author1 = Nielsen Business Media | first1 = Inc | date = 1965-06-26}}<\/ref>\n\nElektra's entrance into pop gained the label considerable prestige on the music scene by being one of the first labels to sign up leading acts from the new wave of American [[psychedelic rock]] of 1966\u201367. The label\u2019s most important signings were the Chicago-based [[Paul Butterfield|Paul Butterfield Blues Band]] (with [[Mike Bloomfield]]), the Los Angeles bands [[Love (band)|Love]] and [[The Doors]], and the Detroit bands [[The Stooges]] and [[MC5]]. Included in Elektra's LA signings were [[Tim Buckley]] and [[Bread (band)|Bread]]. In 1968, the label also signed pioneering rock guitar soloist [[Lonnie Mack]] to a three-album deal.\n\nAlso in 1967, Elektra launched its influential Nonesuch Explorer Series, one of the first collections of what is now referred to as [[world music]]. Excerpts from several Nonesuch Explorer recordings were later included on the two [[Voyager Golden Disc]]s which were sent into deep space in 1977 aboard the [[Voyager 1]] and [[Voyager 2]] space probes.\n\n===The Asylum Records merger===\nElektra, along with its [[Nonesuch Records]] subsidiary, was acquired by [[Kinney National Company]] in 1970. Soon afterwards Kinney consolidated their label holdings under the [[Warner Music Group|Warner-Elektra-Atlantic]] umbrella. Holzman remained in charge of Elektra until 1972, when it merged with [[Asylum Records]] to become Elektra\/Asylum Records; Asylum's founder, [[David Geffen]], would head the newly combined label. Holzman, in the meantime, was appointed senior vice president and chief technologist for Warner \u2014 ushering the company into home video and the first interactive cable system. Holzman also went on to acquire [[Discovery Records]]. In 1975, Geffen stepped down due to health problems. He would be replaced by Joe Smith, who later went on to become CEO of [[Capitol Records]].\n\nJoe Smith, whose leadership resulted in the biggest market share and gross revenues Elektra Asylum was to have, inherited the A&R services of Chuck Plotkin,<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Chuck_Plotkin&oldid=407060973|title=Chuck Plotkin|publisher=|accessdate=9 March 2015}}<\/ref> famed later for producing many of Bruce Springsteen's greatest records, followed up by [[George Daly (Music Industry)|George Daly]], who is credited as bringing in seminal [[New wave music|new wave]] band [[The Cars]], setting Elektra, again, on another artist direction.\n\nAlthough the company was technically listed as \u201cElektra\/Asylum Records\u201d on the label credits, as the years went on the company began to unofficially call itself ''Elektra Records'' again (with Asylum operating as a subsidiary label). In 1982, Elektra launched a jazz subsidiary called [[Elektra\/Musician]]. The following year, [[Bob Krasnow]] became president and CEO of Elektra; under his leadership, the label would reach its commercial peak throughout the rest of the 1980s and early to mid-1990s.\n\n===Elektra Entertainment Group===\nIn 1989, the company officially changed its name to '''Elektra Entertainment'''. During the [[Bob Krasnow]] era, the label became home to a wide range of artists such  as [[Metallica]], [[The Cars]], [[Luna (1990s American band)|Luna]], [[Anita Baker]], [[Stereolab]], [[Teddy Pendergrass]] and [[Third Eye Blind]]. Also during this time, Elektra developed a relationship with the [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based label [[4AD]], becoming the North American label for 4AD acts such as the [[Pixies]], [[the Breeders]], [[Frank Black]] and [[The Amps]].\n\nLike its sister labels, Elektra's fortunes began to wane in the mid-1990s, in part because of a series of bitter corporate battles between senior Warner label executives which seriously damaged the collective reputation of the group. Unhappy with major structural changes enacted by then Warner Music Group chairman Robert Morgado, Bob Krasnow abruptly resigned in July 1994, and others soon followed\u2014the highly respected Warner Bros CEO [[Mo Ostin]] decided not to renew his contract and left in December 1994, and Ostin's friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Lenny Waronker]] left early the next year. Krasnow was replaced by [[Sylvia Rhone]] and during the year the label was renamed ''Elektra Entertainment Group''.\n\nIn September 1994 another damaging controversy erupted when top heavy metal band [[Metallica]] filed suit against Elektra to terminate their contract and gain ownership of their master recordings. The group based its claim on a section of the [[California Labor Code]] that allows employees to be released from a personal services contract after seven years. By this time Metallica had been with the label for more than a decade and had racked up sales of over 40 million records, but they were still operating under the terms of their original 1984 contract, which provided a relatively low 14% royalty rate.<ref>[http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1994\/09\/28\/arts\/heavy-metal-band-sues-record-label.html?pagewanted=1?pagewanted=1 \"Heavy Metal Band Sues Record Label\", ''New York Times'', 28 September 1994]<\/ref> The group also claimed that they were taking the action because Robert Morgado had refused to honor a new deal they had worked out with Bob Krasnow shortly before he quit the label. Elektra responded by counter-suing the group, but in December ''New York'' magazine reported rumours that then Warner Music US chairman Doug Morris had offered the group a lucrative new deal in exchange for dropping the suit<ref>Pat Wechsler & Roger D. Friedman, \"Heavy Metal Gets the Heavy Bucks\", Intelligencer section, ''New York'' magazine, 19\u201326 December 1994, p.26<\/ref> which was reported to be even more generous than the earlier Krasnow deal. In January the group and Elektra jointly announced that they had settled the suit, and although a non-disclosure agreement kept the terms secret, media sources claimed that \"a significant increase in royalty payments to the band as well as a renegotiation of the group's recording contract were key factors in Metallica and Elektra coming to terms.\"<ref>[http:\/\/articles.sfgate.com\/1995-01-06\/entertainment\/17791896_1_metallica-elektra-entertainment-group-band SFGAte.com, 6 January 1995]<\/ref>\n\nDespite having a large stable of noted acts, as the 1990s drew to a close, Elektra began to see a slump in revenue, while noticeably underperforming on the charts. It also developed a bit of a sullen reputation in the industry for not properly promoting many of its releases, thus earning the nickname \"Neglektra\"{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} by many of its acts, and was easily lagging behind its sister labels [[Warner Bros. Records]] and [[Atlantic Records]].\n\n===Atlantic absorption===\nIn February 2004, [[Warner Music Group]] was sold by [[Time Warner]] to a group of private investors made up of Thomas Lee Partners, [[Bain & Company]], and [[Edgar Bronfman Jr.]] (who assumed CEO duties).\n\nLooking for ways to save money, the new owners of WMG decided to merge Elektra and Atlantic Records. Because it was the lesser performing label of the two, 40% of Elektra's operations were put into the new venture, while a commanding 60% of Atlantic's went in. Subsequently, the new company was called \"[[Atlantic Records Group]]\" with Elektra breaking off into a subsidiary which became dormant until the label was revived in 2009 (though longtime time Elektra artists such as [[Tracy Chapman]], [[Bj\u00f6rk]], and [[Yolanda Adams]] continued to have releases on the label while newer signees such as [[Jason Mraz]] and [[Jet (band)|Jet]] were transferred to Atlantic).\n\nElektra's catalog continues to be released\/reissued by [[Rhino Records]], which released a 5-CD box set various-artists [[compilation album|compilation]] titled ''Forever Changing: the Golden Age of Elektra Records 1963-1973'' in November 2006.\n\n===Revival===\nAtlantic Records Group announced the revival of Elektra Records as an independent entity within Warner Music on June 1, 2009.<ref>{{cite news | title = Elektra Flies Again | url = http:\/\/www.wmg.com\/newsdetails\/id\/8a0af812218e73f801219d8c3d1f1868 | last = | first = | work = Atlantic Records Group news release | date = June 1, 2009 | accessdate = June 3, 2009 }}<\/ref> The revived label is headed up by two new co-Presidents: [[Mike Caren]], Exec. VP of A&R for Atlantic Records, and John Janick, founder and President of prominent indie label [[Fueled by Ramen]]. The revived label uses a modified version of the circa-1970s Elektra logo.\n\nThe first release of the new label was the original soundtrack of the HBO show ''[[True Blood]]'', and the first album released was [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]]'s ''[[IRM (album)|IRM]]''. The label is now home to artists such as [[Uffie]], [[Little Boots]], [[Justice (French band)|Justice]], [[Bruno Mars]] and [[Cee-Lo Green]].\n\nOn October 4, 2012, Warner Music announced that [[Jeff Castelaz]], the co-founder of [[Los Angeles]]-based independent label [[Dangerbird Records]], had been named President of Elektra Records.<ref>{{cite news | title = Dangerbird co-founder Jeff Castelaz to head Elektra Records | url = http:\/\/articles.latimes.com\/2012\/oct\/04\/entertainment\/la-et-ms-dangerbird-cofounder-jeff-castelaz-to-head-elektra-records-20121003 | last = Todd | first = Martens | work = Los Angeles Times | date = October 4, 2009 | accessdate = September 22, 2014 }}<\/ref>\n\n==Elektra Records artists==\n{{main|List of Elektra Records artists}}\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Jac Holzman and Gavan Daws.

O. Bailey Companies'''\n\n'''A trusted tradition of integrity, expertise and experience for nearly two hundred years!'''\n\nThe Legacy Continues:  New Owners for a New Century'''\n\nIN 2014, the F.O. Bailey Company changed hands when it was purchased from Joy Piscopo by Falmouth real estate broker David Jones and his wife of 30 years, Nancy McInnis-Jones.  According to Piscopo, the F.O. Bailey name is synonymous with \u201cintegrity, expertise and experience,\u201d and she expects the new owners will live up to that standard.  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have sold it to them if I didn\u2019t feel that they would carry the name into the future in a good way,\u201d she said.  Jones, who has been in the real estate business for 40 years, declined to say how much the couple paid for the name, but said it\u2019s well worth the investment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Maine tradition,\u201d  said David Jones. \u201cThe name F.O. Bailey has the same prominence here as L.L. Bean.  We\u2019re proud to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nProud indeed.  Nancy McInnis-Jones comes from a family of antique appraisers and auctioneers in her native New Hampshire, where her father and siblings established a name for themselves in the field.  Now, it seems, they have an equally prominent name here in Maine.\n\nIf he was alive today, founder Henry Bailey would no doubt be pleased to see his name being carried on by David and Nancy Jones. F.O.Bailey Company today is based at 183 US Route One in Falmouth, Maine 04105. Phone 207-781-1111. The Company has three divisions- Antiquarians; Real Estate; and Auctioneers. Web site:  www.FOBailey.com\n\n* * *\n\nBeginnings of a Dynasty:  The Original Henry Bailey Company\n\nIN 1819, when young Henry Bailey opened a general merchandise store on Ingraham\u2019s Wharf in Portland and began auctioning salvaged goods on the street out front, James Monroe was serving as our country\u2019s fifth president.  Maine was still a part of Massacchsetts (it wouldn\u2019t become a state until 1820), and construction on the Erie Canal had only recently begun. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Portland\u2019s native son and America\u2019s most beloved poet, was only 12 years old.  The country was still very young, but there was a great sense of optimism about the future.\n\nIN 1827, the Bailey Company diversified and began manufacturing rolltop desks and display cabinets for stores.  This required a move to a new, larger facility on Exchange Street, where it operated for \n\nthe next hundred years.  In the smuggling days, and in the bankruptcy-and-seizure days of the Civil War era, the company was forced to make money in myriad ways simply to survive, but always found the auctioneering business to be a particularly good money maker.\n\nBy 1866 Portlanders could look back on nearly a century of astonishing progress.  Their port had grown from a frontier mast landing into a serious cultural and economic rival of Boston.  Fast becoming Canada\u2019s winter rail-head, \u201cthe Forest City\u201d ranked fourth in imports and fifth in exports among American cities.  Rich, proud, vital, and confident, Portlanders seemed to march in lock-step with national events.\n\nBut then the Great Fire of 1866 devastated the city.  In less than 24 hours, the heart of a great American port city was laid in ruins, including the store operated by Henry Bailey.  The grim statistics of 10 million dollars in property loss and 12,000 people left homeless translated into the worst urban fire in America to that date.\n\nA newly rebuilt Exchange Street as it looked after the Great Fire of 1866\n\nOut of the Ashes:  F.O. Bailey Carries On the Family Business\n\nIN 1867, the year after the Great Fire, Henry Bailey died.  Both the city and the Bailey Company would make an astonishing recovery, however.  A rebuilding spirit of pride and determination took over as new Victorian business blocks of brick, stone, and cast iron arose Phoenix-like from the ashes.  The Bailey Company was carried on in 1867 by Henry\u2019s son, Frederick Orville Bailey, in new premises on Exchange Street.  That same year, F.O. Bailey took as a partner a young farm boy from Poland, Maine named         Charles W. Allen.\n\n \n\n                               The Bailey Trotting Sleigh\n\n\nA big but now-forgotten enterprise of the F.O. Bailey Company during the nineteenth century was the sleigh and racing sleds business, reputed to be among the best in the nation, and the manufacture of fine horse carriages from the company\u2019s facilities at the corner of Market and Middle Streets.  Anything and everything having to do with horses and the carriage trade was manufactured and sold here.\n                      \n\nThe Bailey Carriage Company c 1900\n\nIN 1901, F.O. Bailey even went into the automobile business, selling cars costing from $600 to $6,000, when Bailey and Allen formed the Maine Motor Carriage Company at the corner of Free and South Streets. While business was brisk, with sales of about $200,000 in just three years, they seemed to have misjudged the market for what was then seen as a passing fad.  In 1906, young Neal W. Allen wrote as follows about the family automobile business:\n\n\nThe Maine Motor Carriage Company at Free and South Streets\n\n\u201cIn all probability the high water mark of the car business will be reached by about 1908.  The market will soon be oversupplied with machines.  When the present great demand for automobiles is past, the car business will settle down to somewhat the same basis as carriages and sleds.\u201d\n\nThe Maine Motor Carriage Company at Free and South Streets\n\n\nThe Allen Family Takes Over\n\nIN 1912, Charles W. Allen died and the firm was incorporated by Frederick O. Bailey as the F.O. Bailey Company, Inc., with Mr. Allen\u2019s son, Neal W. Allen elected as president.    \n\nIN 1928, after more than a hundred years of doing business on Exchange Street, the F.O. Bailey Company moved to the Free and South Street location.\n\nIN 1933, after years of being a manufacturer of show cases, in addition to the retail furniture and auctioneering businesses, the F.O. Bailey Company actively began the manufacture of fine store fixtures, which could be found installed in many of the most progressive stores throughout New England.\n\n                                                                                                                                  \nThe War Years:  1941 - 1945\n\nThe F.O. Bailey Company was more active than ever in serving war-time Portland and continued on a larger scale to supply Maine people with furniture of all kinds, to ship antiques throughout the nation, and to build finer and more beautiful stores and restaurants throughout New England.  A 1943 company brochure proclaimed:\n\n \u201cOur purpose will be, first of all, to do everything within our power to assure victory; Second, to continue to give every customer quality merchandise and efficient and reliable service so that merchants using the products of our cabinets mill, clients for whom we act as agents or auctioneers and buyers or sellers of antiques, may have complete confidence in our fairness and integrity.\u201d\n\n An F.O. Bailey Company truck making deliveries to the United States Air Force\n\nThe Post-War Period: 1946 - 1976\n\nSome longtime employees of the F.O. Bailey Company gathered at the Roma Cafe in 1979 to celebrate the 160th birthday of the company.  Seated were, from left, Barbara A. Atwood and Merritt S. Higgins.  Standing, Carmine (Jack) Piscopo, Franklin B. Allen, former president, Herman J. Bouchard, Joy Piscopo, Enos E. Johnson, Francesco Palanda, Hilding A. Berg, and Malcolm A. Johnson.\n\n\nThe Piscopo Family Era:  1977 - 2014\n \nIN 1977, Allen family descendants Charles and Franklin Allen were running the company, but were also looking for a buyer.  By then the company had moved from its old Free Street headquarters and was happily situated at 141 Middle Street at the top of the Old Port district, one of the major Victorian business blocks to rise from the ashes of the Great Fire. Erected in 1867 to house the wholesale dry goods firm of Woodman, True and Co, the Woodman Building occupied the corner position of the city\u2019s most impressive row of post fire commercial architecture, all three units of which were the work of the local architect George M. Harding. \n\nJack and Joy Piscopo met with the Allens several times before a deal was struck, and then purchased the business.  For the next twenty-five years the Piscopos operated the F.O. Bailey Company from the Middle Street location, a period described by Joy Piscopo as \u201ca golden age of antique and estate auctions in Maine.\u201d\n\nIN 2004, the Piscopos closed up shop in downtown Portland and moved to a new home in Falmouth, spurred by the changing business atmosphere on Middle Street, the new realities of the auction business, and a desire to downsize their lives.  Here they operated for the next ten years.\n\nThe Woodman Building on Middle Street c 1887\n\nHome of the F.O. Bailey Company for many years.\n\nAuctioneer's receipt for the sale of a painting.

I imagine parents, especially of young children, have little time to devote to editing. <br>\nOf course, all of the regular disclaimers apply, this was not a randomly selected group of Editors, those who are willing to take time to respond to a survey request are those individuals who tend to be more satisfied with the process. <font face=\"Rage Italic\" size=\"4\" color=\"#800080\">[[User:Liz|'''''L'''''iz]]<\/font> <sup><font face=\"Times New Roman\" color=\"#006400\">[[Special:Contributions\/Liz|'''''Read!''''']] [[User talk:Liz|'''''Talk!''''']]<\/font><\/sup> 19:56, 11 October 2013 (UTC)\n\nEnglish Wikipedia at a glance August 2013 \n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" background: #f9f9f9;\n|- align=\"center\"\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Stat\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Data\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Yearly Change\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Monthly Change\n|-\n| Page Views per Month\t\n| 9,985,326,806\t\n| --\n| --\n|-\n| Article Count\t\n| 4,382,898\t\n| +8%\n| +1%\n|-\n| New Articles per Day\t\n| 869\t\n| --\n| --\n|-\n| Edits per Month\n| 2,915,395\n| -16%\n| +2%\n|-\n| Active Editors\n| 30,941\n| -6%\n| +0%\n|-\n| Very Active Editors\n| 3,156\n| -8%\n| -0%\n|-\n| New Editors\n| 5,986\n| -9%\n| -1%\n|-\n| Speakers\n| 1,500,000,000\n| --\n| --\n|-\n| Editors per Million Speakers\t\n| 21\n| --\n| --\n|}\nPage views: 9,985 million\/month = 333 million\/day = 13.9 million\/hour = 231 thousand\/minute = 3.9 thousand\/second\n\n[[File:Editor_culture.png|800px]]\n\n===Other data===\n:Hi [[User:Liz]], Here is another interesting chart I found on a user page (so accuracy and date of data are questions) but whats' really striking to me is that only 1658 editors have more than 3,000 edits and there are 976 administrators.

On hearing musicians like [[Andy Mackay]] of the 1970s band [[Roxy Music]] and Davey Payne, [[Ian Dury]] and [[The Blockheads]] Sherlock developed his own method of playing. This invariably involved experimenting with sound and processing the playing through various effects pedals.\nHe met the vocalist Derek Morris in 1977 and together they formed Electra Vogue. [[Steve Parry (musician)|Steve Parry]] later joined Sherlock and Morris having answered an advert placed by Morris in the [[NME]] for experimental musicians into [[The Velvet Underground]], [[David Bowie]]. This trio of musicians formed the nucleus of what was later to become [[Neu Electrikk]]\n\n===Neu Electrikk===\n{{Main|Neu Electrikk}}\nNeu Electrikk <ref>{{cite book |last=Gimarc |first=George |title=Punk Diary:Ultimate Trainspotters Guide to Underground Rock 1970-1982|year=2006 |publisher=Backbeat Books |location=London |page=429| isbn= 978-0-87930-848-3}}<\/ref> comprised singer songwriter Derek Morris, guitarist and electronics Steve Parry, bass player Nicholas Chamberlain Hunt, sax\/flute\/treatments Steve Sherlock and Barry Deller on drums\/percussion.<ref name=\"dedica.la\">{{cite web|title=Neu Electrikk|publisher=dedica.la|url=http:\/\/www.dedica.la\/artist\/NEU+ELECTRIKK|accessdate=2011-09-18}}<\/ref> Neu Electrikk were based in London and part of the experimental, post punk music scene that included artists like [[This Heat]], [[The The]], [[Wire (band)|Wire]] and [[Throbbing Gristle]]. Live concerts were erratic events, whereby three-minute songs became long passages of improvisation and noise. Neu Electrikk would often take to the stage to the voice of [[Frank Sinatra]] being accompanied by pre-recorded tapes of bird song and the sound of an industrial hammer.\n\n===The The===\n{{Main|The The}}\nSherlock became involved with Matt Johnson having been introduced by Steve Parry. Keith Laws had quit The The and they comprised Matt Johnson with Simon Turner (guitar\/vocals), Colin Lloyd Tucker (guitar\/vocals) and Steve Sherlock (saxophone).<ref name=\"ingsoc\">{{cite web|title=The+The|publisher=[[ingsoc]]|url=http:\/\/www.ingsoc.com\/thethe\/information\/biography.html|accessdate=2011-09-18}}<\/ref> In 1982 he contributed [[Flute]] and Saxophone to 'Three Orange Kisses From Kazan' and 'Waitin' For The Upturn', compositions for the intended debut album by The The (The Pornography of Despair), but this album was never officially released. Both compositions later appeared on the b-side to the 12\" version of 'Uncertain Smile' and were included on the cassette version of [[Soul Mining]].<ref name=\"discogs\">{{cite web|title=The+The|publisher=[[Discogs]]|url=http:\/\/www.discogs.com\/artist\/The+The|accessdate=2011-09-18}}<\/ref> Sherlock played Flute and Saxophone on the [[Demo (music)|demo]] recording of 'Uncertain Smile'.

However, Johnson later recorded a version of the composition in [[New York]] with sax and flute session player Crispin Cioe.

I see there has been some minimal discussion about whether their last names should be used on Wikipedia. I understand why some would initially think we should only use what the network chooses to use on television and their website. I disagree though. We owe it to the performers to have their full drag name available and we owe it to Wikipedia readers to have the information available.  The network's site doesn't use their real \"boy\" names either but we have that on Wikipedia. It boils down to the fact that Wikipedia is about more relevant information, not less. I've added a footnote to their name so readers will understand that they do have a last name but it isn't used on-air. \u2500 '''[[User:Matthewi|Matthewi]]''' <sup>([[User talk:Matthewi|Talk]])<\/sup> \u2022 04:31, 6 February 2013 (UTC)\n\n:::::Like I mentionned earlier, the difference is that if there is a wikipedia page about Alaska or Detox themselves, then fine, on her page feel free to say her full stage name including Thunderfuck and Icunt. But this is not the page of Alaska nor Detox, it's about RuPaul's Drag Race Season 5. Go check the official web page of the show, the press releases and everything else, and you will clearly see that they use Alaska and Detox only. The relevant information here is that on the show, you will never hear nor see Thunderfuck or Icunt, so why bother put it here? It's never mentionned on the show and this page is about the show, not about the queens. I feel like I'm repeting myself, but that's the bottom line.

We definitely never hear their last name. When are you going to delete them? I addressed your point. With all due respect, whether your format is what's agreed on or not, your logic has failed as to WHY their last names aren't included. I've noticed many people have added their last name and it keeps being removed. I provided what I believe to be a logical reason to include their last names: \"It boils down to the fact that Wikipedia is about more relevant information, not less.\" Of course you didn't respond to that point. Also, what you say isn't what goes. Maybe it's just me but your comment reads like you believe your opinion (because that's what it is, an opinion or preference) rules Wikipedia. Let's not make this about you. Okay? To avoid the drama that seems inevitable with making more information available on this page I'll leave it with only their first names but with a footnote telling their full name because, again, Wikipedia is about MORE relevant information, not less. Hopefully you wouldn't get in a editing warring game for drama. There is precedent for adding footnotes when a contestant is known by one name though they have a full name. (I'd note that this season is different because they previous contestants didn't have their names censored by the network, they just typically went by only their first name though they had a first and last name.) Naraht & AMK1211 -- Though the current version is fine with me I'd like to know what you think about using their full drag names on the Wikipedia page. By the way, I just searched NewNowNext.com and noticed they Detox's tag uses her last name and they've also used Alaska's.

Some users want to say she was \"IN\", while some users want to say she was \"LOW\". The mattter has already been discussed between those that edit the page often, and it was decided (technically speaking), that she should be considered \"LOW\" that week. Her impersonation of Katy Perry was poor, as why RuPaul made her tweet an apology. However, she did have immunity, which was the only reason why she was told she was safe. Had it not been for this immunity, she would have been made to stay on stage and given critiques. Season 2 contestants Tyra Sanchez and Tatianna faced the same situation in their season, and they were still marked \"LOW\" rather than being \"IN\". This issue does matter because if she is considered one of the worst of that week, then she will have set a milestone, which of course is always important. Regardless of having immunity, she was still one of the worst in the Snatch Game. This is why she has been marked as \"LOW\". Lineysha follows the same due to her poor performance in the Draggle Rock episode, but having immunity from her win in the previous challenge.

I realize RuPaul's Drag Race is not the only show that utilizes this type of table, but perhaps they could all use a little improvement. [[User:MarkMc1990|MarkMc1990]] ([[User talk:MarkMc1990|talk]]) 02:11, 18 April 2013 (UTC)\n\n:I would have to agree with you. I think that the current format is okay, but it could definately be improved. I agree that HIGH, IN and LOW is not really clear. I like your suggestion. However I think that the \"Was one of the best but did not win\/was one of the worst but did not lip-synch\" is relevant. Especially early-on during each season, there is definately a different between a \"safe\" contestant and a \"one of the best\/worst\". We should keep those in. As far as the color scheme goes, I don't really care. The current one is okay. If you check other reality tv pages on wiki, green does not always mean best, and red doesn't mean eliminated, or worst. But depending on people's opinion, we could change it. And if we do decide to change the format, we would need to do it for every season; keep that in mind! \u2500 [[User:Fabzzz|'''<font color=\"red\">F<\/font><font color=\"orange\">a<\/font><font color=\"gold\">b<\/font><font color=\"green\">z<\/font><font color=\"blue\">z<\/font><font color=\"purple\">z<\/font>''']] [[User talk:Fabzzz|<font color=\"pink\"><sub>talk<\/sub><\/font>]] 03:47, 18 April 2013 (UTC)\n\n::Ok, here is my opinion. Sorry if you don't like it, but here it goes. I LOVE the color scheme. I also LOVE the way it is stylized. Makes perfect sense. My only concern regarding this change is if the word \"SAFE\", regardless of the color, may run together too many times and create a headache for the reader. I just worry about that for some reason. It may be a long row of \"SAFE\", rather than the shorter abbreviations \"HIGH\", \"IN\", and \"LOW\". If no one else thinks this could be a concern, then I am all for the change in the table style. I do have one other question regarding the change. If it decided this format will change, which it must change for all seasons, will the All-Stars table be changed, and if so, how? There are several different color codes and meanings, and I was just wondering how it would be done? I just want to assure this change won't be a hassle to do for ANY page in the Drag Race series. Looking at it now, I could understand why the user suggested a change, especially with all of the colors. There are some other notes that need a color scheme (non-elimination, Miss Congeniality, STAYING to get to the finale, etc.), but it can be worked on in time. As long as a stable color scheme is installed to avoid random colors all over the place, as well as the SAFE issue, I think it would be decorative to the articles. - [[User:Asd17|Asd17]] ([[User talk:Asd17|talk]]) 06:17, 18 April 2013 (UTC)\n\n:My suggestions... First, we need to keep accessibility in mind, particularly when you recommend a red\/green scale. [[WP:COLOR]] has more info. I definitely like the idea of switching to a more gradual scale like this because it's more easily analyzed at a glance. I kind of like sticking with the Win, High, In\/Safe, Low, Out\/Elim, but adding the BTM2 for the current \"yellow\" category. This would also help with that accessibility problem since they recommend an additional way to distinguish a box beyond color. Also perhaps a blue to red scale instead of green to red? (Red\/green colorblindness is by far the most common.) Something like this:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\"\n|-\n|style=\"background: royalblue; text-align:center\"|'''WIN'''\n|style=\"background: lightblue; text-align:center\"|HIGH\n|SAFE\n|style=\"background: lightpink; text-align:center\"|LOW\n|style=\"background: tomato; text-align:center\"|BTM2\n|style=\"background: red; text-align:center\"|'''ELIM'''\n|}\n:Also, while we're discussing it, I don't particularly see the need to distinguish the BTM2 where there was and wasn't an elimination (e.g., with Roxxxy\/Alyssa this season). They were still the bottom two. The fact that there isn't an elimination listed that week makes the rest obvious. The all-stars thing is just confusing though. I don't even know where to go with that insanity. --[[User:Siradia|Siradia]] ([[User talk:Siradia|talk]]) 03:32, 19 April 2013 (UTC)\n\n::I think that ^ makes a lot of sense. (...especially agree with the all-stars table, it's madness!) The blue to red also is a good idea imo. I don't mind about having HIGH and LOW instead of just SAFE\/IN, but the BTM2 and ELIM is an idea we should keep. And to what Asd17 was saying about the fact that if we put SAFE all over the table it's gonna look like a row of SAFE, there are other tv shows that use the SAFE, like [[True Beauty (TV series)|True Beauty]], and it doesn't look too bad, but IN is fine too. I don't mind about any of those two. \u2500 [[User:Fabzzz|'''<font color=\"red\">F<\/font><font color=\"orange\">a<\/font><font color=\"gold\">b<\/font><font color=\"green\">z<\/font><font color=\"blue\">z<\/font><font color=\"purple\">z<\/font>''']] [[User talk:Fabzzz|<font color=\"pink\"><sub>talk<\/sub><\/font>]] 03:53, 19 April 2013 (UTC)\n:::blue to red instead of green to red is fine with me. And I agree that \"non-elimination\" bottom two is an unnecessary distinction and does not need it's own color since they were still the bottom two. I also think the \"STAY\" column in episode 13 of Season 4 looks kind of silly and unnecessary, but that's just my opinion. As for Miss Congeniality, I always thought that was poorly conveyed in the table as well. My honest suggestion is to not mention it in the table at all since it really has nothing to do with the progress of the actual competition.

The only thing I agree with is the gold, silver, bronze colors for the top three places.

The colors I've suggested are widely used in the elimination tables all across Wikipedia maybe cause they're very apt to be honest. Plus the concept of 'Top 3' and 'Btm 3' and 'Btm 2' can be very easily understood through this and long descriptions below the table become unneeded which is a good thing. \n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\"\n|-\n|style=\"background:#fbf373;\"|'''WIN'''\n|style=\"background:#cfc;\"| Top 3\n|SAFE\n|style=\"background:lightpink;\"|Btm 3\n| style=\"background:#ed872d;\"|Btm 2\n| style=\"background:salmon;\" | '''Elim'''\n|}\n\n\n--<small><span style=\"border:2px solid #2E8B57;\">[[User:Imtitanium#top|<font style=\"color:#556B2F;\">&nbsp;'''I'm Titanium'''&nbsp;]]<\/font><\/span><\/small> <sup>[[User_talk:Imtitanium|<font color=\"green\">chat<\/font>]]<\/sup>  05:32, 23 April 2013 (UTC)\n\n:Sometimes there aren't three people in the top or in the bottom in certain weeks. Sometimes there may be 2 or 4, (ex. week 3 of this season; Alaska, Vivienne, AND Lineysha were all declared part of the worst, but still safe). Or as in Weeks 1 and 2, four people were listed in the top. That is why we kept the LOW and HIGH marks, in case there were more or less than three people in either direction. As for the color scheme you have proposed, there is just something about it, that missed what the user was actually hoping to change. The scheme is based on levels. First with a dark blue, transcending down to a light blue, and after SAFE, begins with light pink to signal the start of the worst of the week. The yellow transcending to the light green doesn't feel right. The orange is darker than the salmon, which is another confusion, because as the level gets lower, the darker it gets. Not trying to discredit anyone, I am just trying to show editors reading this section why the table was changed the way it was. [[User:Asd17|Asd17]] ([[User talk:Asd17|talk]]) 10:25, 23 April 2013 (UTC)\n::Exactly. With the newly implemented blue-to-red scale, you could basically look at the table cells and know if they did good or bad that week without even reading the word inside the box. If you do yellow, then pale green, then white, then pink, then dark orange, then light red, it won't flow as logically. [[User:MarkMc1990|MarkMc1990]] ([[User talk:MarkMc1990|talk]]) 17:18, 23 April 2013 (UTC)\n\n:::One of the main reason for the change was to have better fluidity between colors depending on their performance that week. Like the last two person said, going for light green to yellow for the best, and then pink and orange for the worst is a bit confusing and would just re-establish the \"problem\" we had in the first place. I think the HIGH and LOW does the job well to represent if one queen was one of the best\/worst, and can be use regardless of how many there are. And going back to what someone said about the sorting arrows; I don't think it was that useful. You don't really see that on any reality-TV show page on wiki. When you click to sort a column, it messes the whole table and once you've sorted one column, there's no way to go back to the original table without refreshing the page. No one has complained about it and it's been like that for a lot more than a month since it has been removed. I think it's better like that and nothing should change, color scheme and arrows. \u2500 [[User:Fabzzz|'''<font color=\"red\">F<\/font><font color=\"orange\">a<\/font><font color=\"gold\">b<\/font><font color=\"green\">z<\/font><font color=\"blue\">z<\/font><font color=\"purple\">z<\/font>''']] [[User talk:Fabzzz|<font color=\"pink\"><sub>talk<\/sub><\/font>]] 21:27, 23 April 2013 (UTC)\n\nThe one that is currently on the page is very confusing and makes no sense whatsoever.

Also, the whole gold\/silver\/bronze angle makes no sense. There is no true second or third place (no proze given, etc.) so why would it be colored like that?

Someone proposed it about 2 weeks ago, and people that edit on wikipedia and know how to improve a page and make it better gave their opinion about how it should be modified. We came to a conclusion and decided to change all seasons of drag race to this new format. If you see some minor changes that can be done, like the first\/second place coloring, that should be changed, fine, we will see what we can do. But I really don't think that re-putting the LOW for both bottom 2 and worst of the week makes sense, I really don't think orange and pink are appropirate colors for LOW, I really don't think just leaving a blank for queens that are safe represents well a queen's performance and this would be truly misleading; more so than the gold and silver. The current version, in general, is perfectly fine like it is and has been approved by many wiki users, and will remain like that. Like I said, we still can see about the first\/second coloring. \u2500 [[User:Fabzzz|'''<font color=\"red\">F<\/font><font color=\"orange\">a<\/font><font color=\"gold\">b<\/font><font color=\"green\">z<\/font><font color=\"blue\">z<\/font><font color=\"purple\">z<\/font>''']] [[User talk:Fabzzz|<font color=\"pink\"><sub>talk<\/sub><\/font>]] 17:24, 28 April 2013 (UTC)\n\n:Can someone explain to me how on earth pink to orange to light red possibly makes more sense and is less confusing than a gradual change from light to dark red?

I have an account (retired) and have edited wikis for many many years.  Second, people who are color blind need to be taken into consideration, and your 'gradual' change in color is nearly impossible to differentiate for them. That is why you see other show pages using the colors that they do. Gradients are bad for the wiki and against policy per visuals. You need pretty distinct colors on the chart.

She also holds the most weeks to be critiqued, with 12 (twelve) weeks in all. Just a thought. [[User:Asd17|Asd17]] ([[User talk:Asd17|talk]]) 14:55, 20 May 2013 (UTC)\n\n== Table Color Edits ==\n\nSome users are once again challenging the current color scheme. Ideas for new additions users are adding to the table include:\n:Double Elimination\n:Week 2 (contestants who actually did better than being just safe, due to being a team challenge).\n:Perfoming poor, but being safe only by use of immunity.\n:2nd best in each challenge.\n\nI actually viewed the page for season 2 of Paris Hilton's My New Bff, and was shocked by all of the different colors used on that table. Users have engaged in edit wars because of disagreements about what is represented on the table. The Wikipedia community and editors of the Drag Race pages need to discuss what colors should and shouldn't be on the table, since it appears there should be more noted than there actually is. Personally, I agree with the note about week 2, several contestants did really great, but because this was based on a team challenge, they were only noted as SAFE. Season 4 episode 2 can be identified in the same way. [[User:Asd17|Asd17]] ([[User talk:Asd17|talk]]) 17:20, 26 May 2013 (UTC)\n\n:The contestants table is perfect like it is. We just changed it to a more concise and accurate format. We don't need to turn this into a rainbow with a ton of different colors. It just gets confusing at some point. You said it, look at the New Bff page and see how much of a mess it is? Exactly. You don't wanna turn this table into a headache for the viewers. The table is clear enough as it is. Other necessary info is either in the episode summary or as a footnote. \u2500 [[User:Fabzzz|'''<font color=\"red\">F<\/font><font color=\"orange\">a<\/font><font color=\"gold\">b<\/font><font color=\"green\">z<\/font><font color=\"blue\">z<\/font><font color=\"purple\">z<\/font>''']] [[User talk:Fabzzz|<font color=\"pink\"><sub>talk<\/sub><\/font>]] 23:40, 28 May 2013 (UTC)\n\n::Agree completely.

It serves patients in the London Boroughs of [[London Borough of Hounslow|Hounslow]], [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames|Richmond upon Thames]] and [[London Borough of Ealing|Ealing]]. The hospital has over 400 beds.\n\nThe hospital offers all of the services associated with a district general hospital including [[Emergency Department|Accident and Emergency]], Acute Medicine, [[Elderly care|Care of the Elderly]], Surgery and Maternity Services.\n\nIn 2003 West Middlesex University Hospital opened its brand new main building following a \u00a350 million refurbishment and it is now a modern, compact hospital. This houses A&E, critical care, operating theatres, clinical imaging, outpatients and patient suites.\n\nThe hospital is a teaching hospital of [[Imperial College School of Medicine]] and a member of the Imperial College Academic Health Sciences Partnership.<ref>[http:\/\/www3.imperial.ac.uk\/newsandeventspggrp\/imperialcollege\/newssummary\/news_25-11-2011-13-11-32] Imperial College website<\/ref> It also has an active volunteer program. Undergraduate students from the American university [Central College] are also allowed to complete internships at WMUH.\n\nDecember 2011: West Middlesex was awarded full accreditation by UNICEF as a Baby Friendly hospital, the first London hospital to achieve this award. The Baby Friendly Initiative accredits maternity and community facilities which adopt internationally recognised standards of best practice.\n\nIn September 2012 the Trust concluded that it was not viable for it to apply for [[NHS Foundation Trust]] status and decided to seek a potential partner.<ref>{{cite news|title=Analysed: The London FT pipeline and its hotspots|url=http:\/\/www.hsj.co.uk\/hsj-local\/local-briefing\/london\/analysed-the-london-ft-pipeline-and-its-hotspots\/5051933.article#.UngJ-flT6UM|accessdate=4 November 2013|newspaper=Health Service Journal|date=20 November 2012}}<\/ref> As of 1 September 2015, West Middlesex University Hospital is part of [[Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Hospitals join forces in bigger, better organisation|url=http:\/\/www.chelwest.nhs.uk\/about-us\/news\/hospitals-join-forces-in-bigger-better-organisation|publisher=Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust|accessdate=9 September 2015}}<\/ref>\n\nUnder the North West London strategy, ''Shaping a healthier future'', the Trust was designated as a major hospital in 2013.\n\nThe Trust was highlighted by [[NHS England]] as having 3 of 148 reported [[never events]] in the period from April to September 2013.<ref>{{cite news|title=NHS reveals 'never event' figures|url=http:\/\/www.thestar.co.uk\/news\/regional\/nhs-reveals-never-event-figures-1-6311784|accessdate=14 December 2013|newspaper=Sheffield Star|date=13 December 2013}}<\/ref>\n\n==History==\nThe hospital opened in 1894 as the Brentford Workhouse Infirmary. In about 1920 the hospital became the West Middlesex Hospital. When the original buildings were no longer suitable for the needs of the hospital, the hospital was redeveloped. Approximately half of the original site was sold, allowing refurbishment of two remaining buildings at the east of the site. The new building, constructed between 2001 and 2003, was funded by a [[Private Finance Initiative]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of hospitals in England]]\n* [[List of NHS trusts]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http:\/\/www.west-middlesex-hospital.nhs.uk\/ Official website]\n*[http:\/\/www.radiowestmiddlesex.org.uk\/ Radio West Middlesex]\n\n{{Imperial College London}}\n{{coord|51.4736|-0.3257|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:NHS hospital trusts]]\n[[Category:Isleworth]]\n[[Category:NHS hospitals in London]]","timestamp":"20160410103937","user-timestamp":"20150410103937"},{"title":"Askham, Northern Cape","content":"{{refimprove|date=October 2013}}\n{{Infobox South African town\n| name                    = Askham\n| native_name             = \n| other_name              = \n| image_skyline           = \n| image_caption           = \n| latd  = 26 |latm  = 58 |lats  = 54\n| longd = 20 |longm = 46 |longs = 51\n| province                = Northern Cape\n| district                = ZF Mgcawu\n| municipality            = Mier\n| established_date        = \n| government_type         = \n| leader_party            = \n| leader_title            = Councillor\n| leader_name             = \n| area_footnotes          = <ref>{{cite web|title=Main Place Askham|url=http:\/\/census2011.adrianfrith.com\/place\/377008|publisher=Census 2011|accessdate=7 December 2013}}<\/ref> \n| area_total_km2          = 3.11\n| elevation_m             = \n| postal_code             = 8814\n| postal2_code            = 8814\n| area_code               = 054\n| censuscode              = \n| website                 = \n| footnotes               = \n}}\n'''Askham''' is a village in the [[Mier Local Municipality]] in the [[ZF Mgcawu District Municipality]] in the [[Northern Cape]] province of [[South Africa]].

It was issued on [[DVD]] on October 28, 2005, by Indican Pictures.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nThis [[camp (style)|camp]] [[screwball comedy film|screwball comedy]] of errors, that includes many over-the-top [[stereotype]]s, is set at [[Halloween]] against the backdrop of [[West Hollywood, California]].\n\nFive friends, [[interior design]]er Evan (played by London); interior designer Harvey (played by Cheng); [[African American]] [[stockbroker]] Dave (played by Meadows); [[Latino]] [[indoor cycling|spinning]] instructor Fredrico (played by Sab\u00e0to); and Emme (played by Ubach), a sassy young woman obsessed with style and classic movies, have all been anticipating the [[West Hollywood Halloween Parade]] on Santa Monica Boulevard, which is the biggest and brashest block party of the year. Their annual tradition of joining the festivities in outrageous costumes has become part of local legend.\n\nIt is the night before Halloween, however, and they still have not decided what to be. Evan and Harvey, who are [[butch and femme|femme]] [[gay]] boyfriends and business partners, have come up with food-themed [[sushi]] costumes that everyone refers to as \"[[wasabi]] tuna.\" Emme offers another suggestion &mdash; that they all dress up as [[gang]] members.\n\nThey all opt for the gang theme, but are unable to find the appropriate attire at the local stores. They then decide to seek out [[real life]] gang members in order to achieve the authentic, straight-from-the-hood look they want.\n\nWhile doing interior design work for an extremely wealthy [[Armenians|Armenian]] woman who is actually in the [[illegal drug trade]], Harvey and Evan become unwitting drug couriers. After they are arrested, there is a comic scene at the [[West Hollywood, California|WeHo]] [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department|sheriff's station]] with them attempting to talk their way out of trouble.\n\nDave goes to [[East Los Angeles, California|East L.A.]], where he comes across a real gang member named Romeo (played by D\u00edaz). He makes a deal with Romeo to loan him his [[Porsche]] in exchange for his [[lowrider]] gang car. A case of mistaken identity makes a vengeful, rival gang get after them. There is a comic [[drive-by shooting]] scene. Also, by driving Romeo's lowrider they are unknowingly carrying an illegal cache of weapons.\n\n[[Reality television|Reality TV]] actress Anna Nicole Smith's (appearing as herself) pet dog, Sugar-Pie, is kidnapped. All is havoc, as a group of [[drag queen]]s who dress like Smith, Santa Ana Anna (played by Arquette), Eenie Anna (played by Gil, who is a [[dwarfism|dwarf]]), Brown Sugar Anna and Hot Spicy Anna, believe that Harvey stole their idol's dog and band together to get Sugar-Pie back for Smith.\n\nA wild chase ensues as gang members, drug dealers, drag queens, and the police force are after the partygoers. They end up in [[Chinatown, Los Angeles, California|Chinatown]], where an old [[Chinese people|Chinese]] man, Mr. Ling (also played by Cheng), is in partnership with the Armenian drug shrew. Everything culminates with the [[clash of personalities]] colliding in a feisty showdown. A free-for-all [[street fighting|street fight]], involving the gang members, drug dealers, undercover [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] detectives, a trio of female [[martial arts]] [[gymnast]]s and the Santa Ana Annas, erupts and everyone battles it out with flying fists, feet and wigs.\n\nAnna Nicole Smith herself arrives and saves the day. As she shamelessly mocks herself, Smith clears up the Sugar-Pie mess, hands the drugs over to the police and invites the group to her Halloween party, where they change into their \"wasabi tuna\" costumes.\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0348354|title=Wasabi Tuna}}\n*[http:\/\/www.rottentomatoes.com\/m\/wasabi_tuna\/reviews.php ''Wasabi Tuna''] at [[Rotten Tomatoes]]\n*[http:\/\/movies.yahoo.com\/shop?d=hv&id=1808567061&cf=info ''Wasabi Tuna''] at [[Yahoo!

The reason I would like this considered is \n\n1) no other country's Scouting articles are divided into such minute details (except for [[The Scout Association of Hong Kong]], and really, is that much minutiae important or interesting to the reader?)\n\n2) many councils that a reader may choose to look up, like the Fitchburg Area Council of Massachusetts or the Vigilante Area Council of Montana, went extinct 30+ years ago, yet may be of interest in a more state-based article\n\n3) many states like Alaska share a communal Scout history, only fairly recently being broken into smaller councils, others like North Dakota had several merged into one, and some Scouting histories are better told encompassing an entire state. The fact that Scouts in California prior to the charter of the BSA were the youth arm of the California Highway Patrol, or the fact that Connecticut, while having only eight counties, has had 22 councils over the course of its history, would be well-included in a statewide article\n\n[[User:Kintetsubuffalo|Chris]] 00:58, 8 January 2006 (UTC)\n\n==Chester Nimitz==\n* '''[[Nimitz Farm]]''', a Boy Scout camp in Pennsylvania-which council?

It is a minority entity that has a higher population of a particular minority ethnic group. The [[Constitution of the Philippines]] allows for two autonomous regions: for [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordilleras]] and Muslim [[Mindanao]].\n\n== Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao ==\n[[File:Ph locator armm.png|thumb|right]]\nThe [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] (ARMM) was proposed in 1976 during the [[Ferdinand Marcos]] administration and created on August 1, 1989 through Republic Act No. 6734 (otherwise known as the Organic Act) in pursuance with a constitutional mandate. In 2012 President [[Benigno Aquino III]] described ARMM as a \"failed experiment\". He proposed an autonomous region named [[Bangsamoro (political entity)|Bangsamoro]] to replace ARMM with the [[Bangsamoro Basic Law|agreement]] between [[Philippines|the government]] and [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]].\n\nA [[plebiscite]] was held in the provinces of Basilan, Cotabato, Davao del Norte, Davao Oriental, Davao del Sur, Lanao del Norte, Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Palawan, South Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, Zamboanga del Norte and Zamboanga del Sur; and in the cities of Cotabato, Davao, Dapitan, Dipolog, General Santos, Koronadal, Iligan, Marawi, Pagadian, Puerto Princesa and Zamboanga to determine if their residents wished to be part of the ARMM. Of these areas, only four provinces - Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi - voted in favor of inclusion in the new autonomous region. The ARMM was officially inaugurated on November 6, 1990 in Cotabato City, which was designated as its provisional capital.\n\nThe region is led by [[Mujiv S. Hataman]].\n\n== Cordilleras ==\nThe  [[Cordillera Administrative Region]] administers the area that was designated for an autonomous region. Two plebiscites were held in the Cordilleras, [[Cordillera Autonomous Region creation plebiscite, 1998|the latest in 1998]], to create an autonomous region and both failed.

Obviously, first off, editing warring of any form is bad, that's a given.\n\nIn normal mainspace content, as long as content doesn't immediately fall under the domain of vandalism, nonsense, and inappropriate content (BLP violations), neither side of a dispute should edit war; say newbie editor A makes a change that is generally against consensus but doesn't harm WP for it being there, experienced editor B reverts, and editor A reverts back (despite WP:BRD); at that point, editor B should really start a discussion and not revert back despite it being the \"wrong version\" until they either confirm consensus that the original way was better or to convince A why not to include.\n\nPolicy and guideline space is very different because people constantly refer to these to help resolve the mainspace debates among other things; while it is possible that pages may get protected at the \"wrong version\" due to edit warring, pages should not change at all until consensus has been sought to make the change.  Thus, if newbie editor A alters a p\/g which experienced editor B, assuming good faith, recognizes has no consensus, should revert that change.  At that point, because p\/g pages should remain stable and at a version that is considered to have consensus, B should open discussion to explain why A's change is inappropriate as to stem a further revert by editor A. (and I will admit this hasn't been done in all cases, but when Plot's being removed by the same people involved in previous discussion, I think it's fairly obvious that discussion either was either ongoing or recently concluded).  Now, if A continues to make the change (as pretty much only Pixelface has done, none of the other editors cited above) without establishing consensus, other editors should revert that.  Or in other words, p\/g pages should not be changed from a long-existing \"correct version\", and edits should be done to maintain that, until it is shown that the consensus is there to change it.   This still allows for BOLD additions that don't get reverted, though usually good form to explain why you made the change at the talk page as to prep discussion in case it does.   (And of course, edits to copyedit, remove or fix vandalism and the like are all appropriate).\n\nSo, short answer: there are probably isolated instance of editors both changing PLOT and reverting it where discussion was not initiated at some point during the process, but p\/g pages should not be changed in the first place until consensus is shown or via the [[WP:BRD]] pathway.  If you subtract out Pixelface's contributions and reverts from that, the actions of editors cited above would have likely not caused any disruption (that is, there's no need to correct this behavior by remedies), but this should not be considered as approval of this type of behavior - we all need to make sure there is discussion on p\/g pages after the first edit or revert and no later than that.  However, Pixelface alone has shown a stubbornness to toe the line of 3RR revert warring on PLOT and other places without discussing the change after the 2nd revert.  That is not appropriate at all and that's a key point that needs to be addressed in this RFC\/U. --[[User:Masem|M<font size=\"-3\">ASEM<\/font>]] 06:21, 1 January 2009 (UTC)\n*This is a relatively nuanced point but I want to be clear that the policy is silent on this.

This is a case of Editor A reverting editor C, D, E, and F across a half dozen policy pages over a period of weeks and months.  It isn't so much that other people aren't \"edit warring\", but we can't really call it that if Pixel continually reverts and the editors responding are different each time (and not acting in concert).

You have to consider each case on it's own.\n*******Case 1 (Collectonian\/DGG\/Hiding) - a three-way revert that included both a language change and a relocation of plot.  Yes, that was a problem, and you'll notice that after Ned Scott reverted back to the last stable version and Black Kite protected the page.  That was a case of trying too many things at the same time that confused matters, and while active discussion was going on.\n*******Case 2 (Hobit\/myself) - Hobit's revert was an extension of a string of PF's rereverts in the hours before that, and thus was inappropriate to have been made.\n*******Case 3 (Colonel Warden\/S@bre) - C.

It ''has'' to be done by communication at the talk page and after a 1RR step, should only be changed if consensus is clearly shown the change is appropriate.

I wonder if we can do a wiki wide pull or something to get a consensus on plot, because clearly a larger number of editors who add the plot sections to thousands of articles believe we should cover them.  For what it is worth, where I stand is not that we should have a bunch of plot only articles, but that we can and should improve them by adding development and reception sections rather than just give up on them and in instances where we can't find sufficient sources to build such sections but are able to verify that the article is not a hoax, then we should redirect as valid search term.

Starting an RFC (even though there was one in April 08 started by PF) is a good solution, though I would expect that editors abide by the consensus gathered there and not keep trying or shopping for a different forum to get the desired result.  PF did start an RFC once so that's at least one positive step.  What is not a good thing is constantly changing policy pages without clearly showing that the consensus exists to make a change to longstanding policy.  (see [[WP:POLICY]]).

Pixelface is free to make any edits to the page, but if these edits are reverted within 7 days, Pixelface may not re-revert the changes as per [[WP:BRD]] without seeking further consensus on the talk page, save in cases of obvious vandalism or editing correction(2).  If Pixelface's suggested changes do not gain consensus, Pixelface may not attempt the same or a very similar change for a period of at least three months, after which [[WP:CCC|consensus may have changed]](3).  All editors are cautioned that edit-warring on policy or guideline pages is inappropriate and may lead to administrative action.(4)''\n*(1) I don't know if we should limit it to only [[WP:NOT]] or include [[WP:NOTE]], [[WP:WAF]], and others; NOT is the key one of recent behavior.\n*(2) This prevents someone from gaming Pixelface if they add something that is accepted on the p\/g pages but revert that change much later, and Pixel attempts to revert.  And obviously fighting vandalism is a good thing.\n*(3) PF must be allowed to attempt to seek more clarification given WP:CCC after a period of time - we just don't need a new discussion every 2 weeks or every month.\n*(4) While I feel this is a one-way street in that PF is editwarring against consensus, it should be noted per others concerns that no editor should be edit warring policy and guideline pages.\nOf course, this may be too wordy and likely can be cleaned up, but as a starting point, I think this addresses most of the concerns. --[[User:Masem|M<font size=\"-3\">ASEM<\/font>]] 18:01, 31 December 2008 (UTC)\n* I might support a softer restriction, but I think we need to look at a wider range of policy pages. Pixelface should be free to make any edits to policy pages, but for the next few months he must propose them for discussion and get consensus for his viewpoint *before* making the edit. He is still entitled to revert other peoples' *recent* edits, but he's not allowed to game the system by making a change under the guise of a \"revert\" across several months or years. I'd apply this restriction to all guidelines and policies, because it's obvious that his edit warring has spilled out onto redirects, [[WP:OCAT]], and so on. Not just [[WP:NOT]]\/[[WP:NOTE]]\/[[WP:WAF]]. We need to show that it's unacceptable everywhere.

Pixelface may be removing it more so than anyone else, but he is not the only one to be doing so, i.e. if there is a broader edit war on Plot, he not the only person on that side of the dispute. Some of what I have seen in this RfC makes it seem as if ''only'' Pixelface has removed Plot, but that is actually not true.

The issue at hand is edit warring and refusal to get the point.  Simply saying \"well, there are two sides to this coin so nothing can happen to Pixelface unless it happens to everyone else\" is pretty inaccurate.  [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment\/Kww]] or [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment\/Protonk]] are all available if there is some concern about incivility. [[User:Protonk|Protonk]] ([[User talk:Protonk|talk]]) 23:57, 31 December 2008 (UTC)\n**Saying that it is only Pixelface is inaccurate and unproductive.  If we want to move forward, we must be willing to honestly acknowledge that others have fanned the fires by being incivil to Pixelface and edit warring with him.  Happy New Year!  Sincerely, --[[User:A Nobody|A Nobody]]<sup>''[[User talk:A Nobody|My talk]]''<\/sup> 03:40, 1 January 2009 (UTC)\n***...I understand your position.  Repeating it doesn't help.  It also ''isn't'' necessary to agree with your position in order to move forward. [[User:Protonk|Protonk]] ([[User talk:Protonk|talk]]) 03:51, 1 January 2009 (UTC)\n****It's a new year; let us take the bold step of not making 2009 yet another partisan year of conflict.  Editors should take steps to reach out to each other as the proactive means of resolving these disputes, not going after some while ignoring others.  Editors should not just make things work their way by excusing some editors' incivility while attacking others' for it.  Either incivility is wrong for everyone or it is not.  Either edit warring is wrong for everyone or it is not.  I think Randomran and some other above want to move forward, not regress, not stagnate and have realized that to do so we all have to compromise with and forgive each other.  I think we are all adults and we should thus all know that we gain nothing by holding grudges and letting animosity linger perpetually.  All of us should start this year fresh and try as hard as we can to work cooperatively.  Take care!  Sincerely, --[[User:A Nobody|A Nobody]]<sup>''[[User talk:A Nobody|My talk]]''<\/sup> 03:59, 1 January 2009 (UTC)\n*****It isn't \"regressing\" or \"Stagnating\" to say that the crux of the dispute is edit warring and that we don't want Pixelface to edit war on PLOT related policies.  And it ''is'' Pixelface edit warring on these policies--other editors reverting him piecemeal isn't edit warring, its the result of his willingness to edit against consensus.  Should there be some other editor who takes it upon himself to revert Pixelface continually, that's obviously edit warring and should be dealt with appropriately.  But the fact that dispute exists over the subject doesn't suddenly make all parties to the dispute equally culpable.  That's my main point.  That's what Kww is trying to get across.  It's fine to acknowledge that people treat Pixel like shit sometimes (see my comment on the RfC).  Where that results in some problem, it should be dealt with.  But this is a comment about Pixelface's behavior.  It is not a comment on WP:PLOT generally, nor is it a comment on the ongoing disputes over notability.  As such marginal infractions on that turf between editors is extraneous to this RfC and should be ignored.  What I see you doing is bringing up these notions \"''Either incivility is wrong for everyone or it is not.  Either edit warring is wrong for everyone or it is not.''\"  Those are broad statements of principle, not ways for this RfC to move forward.  Edit warring ''is'' wrong for everyone.  Incivility ''is'' wrong for everyone.  But that doesn't help us here.  It does '''not''' follow from those statements that \"either we punish all parties for edit warring here or we punish none\" because we are not meting out punishment.  Wikipedia isn't an exercise in distributional justice.  We are going to try to create a result that minimizes disruption and comes from consensus.  The easiest route out of here would be to get Pixelface to participate.  Failing that, we will try to come up with some minimum solution.  Should that solution (or a solution that comes from collaboration) include recommendations that we watch for edit warring by all sides, fine, but I am opposed to jamming up the works simply on the basis of accusations of incivility. [[User:Protonk|Protonk]] ([[User talk:Protonk|talk]]) 04:22, 1 January 2009 (UTC)\n******Thus, the bottom line is Pixelface shouldn't edit war over Plot and nor should those who have reverted him for removing it ''as well'' as reverting at least four other users (including multiple times by the same individuals) as cited above.  The way to move forward is to remind everyone not to edit war, not to be incivil, and to reach out to each other.  It's a new year, I'm drinking my Champagne as I type, and I hope you and your family are too.  I wish everyone a happy new year and hope that 2009 will be a far more collegial one than 2008.  Have a nice night to all!  Sincerely, --[[User:A Nobody|A Nobody]]<sup>''[[User talk:A Nobody|My talk]]''<\/sup> 05:53, 1 January 2009 (UTC)\n*******The bottom line is not that.  Masem wasn't edit warring when he reverted pixel's change once on PLOT.  Jack Merridew probably was.  Collectonian might have been.  There are varying degrees of this and the response should be proportional.  Proportionality doesn't mean creating a solution that ignores the crux of the problem. [[User:Protonk|Protonk]] ([[User talk:Protonk|talk]]) 07:14, 1 January 2009 (UTC)\n********Masem didn't only revert Pixelface's changes to plot, but at least one other editor's as well.  The crux of the problem seems to be that various editors disagree about whether Plot should be included, i.e. it lacks real consensus.  None of these editors should edit war over it.  By now the whole bold, revert, etc. has been exhausted.  Everyone should just discuss it, maybe reach out to the broader community somehow to get a consensus and take steps to move forward.  I really hope everyone can do that.  Randomran, DGG, myself, etc. have reached out to Pixelface.  Who knows maybe through those gestures we'll all get somewhere.  Take care!  --[[User:A Nobody|A Nobody]]<sup>''[[User talk:A Nobody|My talk]]''<\/sup> 07:17, 1 January 2009 (UTC)\n*********As I've noted above, [[WP:POLICY]] demands stronger adherence to editing rules for p\/g pages; changes to p\/g that are reverted need to be discussed and agreed by consensus to be kept, and the removal of PLOT thoughout all last year has yet to be shown to have strong consensus to remove.  Any editor that has been part of that discussion should be aware of that, so removing PLOT by these editors can be seen as disruptive, with the reversions to the long-standing version as necessary corrective measures.  Obviously, at some point if this is done someone needs to start a discussion - if not the one removing PLOT then the ones reverting it should at least try to start something.  From this aspect, yea, those of us that reverted could have done more by starting discussion, though I would easily stated that with the reversions to PF's latest removals, the regulars (including PF) of WT:NOT well understand the various issues over PLOT and there's really no point in rehashing the entire discussion over and over. --[[User:Masem|M<font size=\"-3\">ASEM<\/font>]] 16:27, 1 January 2009 (UTC)\n**********Because multiple editors have removed it, I wonder in such cases if we are better off then leaving it off until a consensus is reached or keeping it, but noting that it is disputed or under discussion?  Best, --[[User:A Nobody|A Nobody]]<sup>''[[User talk:A Nobody|My talk]]''<\/sup> 03:12, 2 January 2009 (UTC)\n*** To [[User:A Nobody]], I think it's fair to acknowledge that there has been incivility on all sides. But I think Protonk is questioning the \"equivelency\" that you're suggesting. Two or three reverts one week just isn't equivalent to an edit war once a month over several months, along with repeatedly creeping right up to the edge of [[WP:3RR]] without crossing the line.

If you think that other people have crossed the line to the same degree as Pixelface, then I guess you're entitled to your opinion. But I don't think very many people will see that \"equivalency\" as credible and we'll have to agree to disagree. [[User:Randomran|Randomran]] ([[User talk:Randomran|talk]]) 18:51, 1 January 2009 (UTC)\n****As I've said above, I think Pixelface has probably made the most reverts, but just think it should be clear that while those others only removed it once or twice, the fact that at least four others have also removed it shows that it is not a case of one editor versus everyone, rather that there are others who also share his viewpoint.  I felt a bit concerned that it is being misrepresented as a totally unilateral war on Plot by one editor, when it is clear that he is not alone in the effort to remove that section.  He may indeed have gone about it more aggresively than others; however, I believe I saw him write somewhere perhaps on his talk page that he is not going to edit war any further on it or something to that effect and if what everyone wants is to avoid edit wars and he seems to be agreeing to do so than I guess that goal has been accomplished.  Best, --[[User:A Nobody|A Nobody]]<sup>''[[User talk:A Nobody|My talk]]''<\/sup> 03:12, 2 January 2009 (UTC)\n*****The status of PLOT is '''not''' the discussion of this RFC\/U, it is PF's actions of rereverting multiple times despite what [[WP:POLICY]] states.  It doesn't matter if there are others that agree with them, WP:POLICY is pretty clear that exceeding 1RR changes is disruptive and that action needs to stop.  Yes, it's clear that an RFC on PLOT is probably necessary but that doesn't not excuse PF from 2RR\/3RR removals. --[[User:Masem|M<font size=\"-3\">ASEM<\/font>]] 03:19, 2 January 2009 (UTC)\n******Part of my concern with these threads and what makes them unproductive is that they seem to keep splitting down partisan lines.  Some will say that TTN mass nominating articles for deletion with tendentious copy and paste nominations that overwhelm AfD is not disruptive and that anyone who starts threads on him should be blocked.  Yet, somehow edit warring on a policy page rather than disrupting the mainspace is of such significance that we have to focus on one editor and not try to acknowledge the broader issues, i.e. that maybe it isn't just any one editor's behavior, but a much broader dispute and pinning it on any one or two editors doesn't really resolve the larger issues.  If what this RfC as started is about is to encourage him to not edit war, he has already agreed not to do so.  I don't see anything gained by not giving him a chance to follow through with it before trying to formally sanction him.  Let's give him a good faith chance first.  Best, --[[User:A Nobody|A Nobody]]<sup>''[[User talk:A Nobody|My talk]]''<\/sup> 03:30, 2 January 2009 (UTC)\n***** Respectfully, I think you're missing the point of this RFC\/U. No one is misrepresenting this as though Pixelface is the only person who has tried to remove [[WP:PLOT]]. Of course people agree with his viewpoint, and there are very few viewpoints on Wikipedia that would be considered disruptive in of themselves. What makes Pixelface unique is that he is the only one who has edit warred over it -- you won't find anyone with the same editing pattern I showed you above. If he is willing to understand that it is his editing pattern (and not his viewpoint) that is disruptive, and if he is willing to stop voluntarily, then I think that will go a long way to finding a softer remedy. Speaking only for myself, but I'd be willing to consider just a strong warning, with no formal sanctions. But the problem is if him and other editors refuse to acknowledge his breach of behavioral policy. If he insists that he is acting within the norms of acceptable behavior, then I hope he understands that will undermine his credibility as this dispute continues. [[User:Randomran|Randomran]] ([[User talk:Randomran|talk]]) 03:22, 2 January 2009 (UTC)\n******See [[User_talk:Pixelface#RFC.2FU]]. I see no reason not to give him the benefit of the doubt. It's a holiday. let's start things off by assuming good faith. He's not removing it further, he said he won't; if he lies then that's another story, but we should give him a chance just as we would want others to give us a chance too. Best, --[[User:A Nobody|A Nobody]]<sup>''[[User talk:A Nobody|My talk]]''<\/sup> 03:23, 2 January 2009 (UTC)\n*******\"''I have promised to not edit WP:NOT during January''\" is a weak pledge, and nothing that I can see as a substantive step in the right direction.&mdash;[[User:Kww|Kww]]([[User talk:Kww|talk]]) 03:29, 2 January 2009 (UTC)\n********He goes further though with \"I am also considering not editing that policy, and maybe not commenting about PLOT on its talkpage, for a few months or more.\"  Best, --[[User:A Nobody|A Nobody]]<sup>''[[User talk:A Nobody|My talk]]''<\/sup> 03:31, 2 January 2009 (UTC)\n*********But we're not trying to silence PF, and talk page input is important (though the way PF approaches certain discussions as outlined in the other points in this RFC\/U needs to be addressed separately).  Sure, it's PF's choice not to input onto the page, but the last thing we want to is to prevent PF from providing input.   But as to the \"promise\", it's again missing the point of the RFC\/U in regards to editing p\/g pages.  --[[User:Masem|M<font size=\"-3\">ASEM<\/font>]] 03:37, 2 January 2009 (UTC)\n**********I've made another suggestion to him on his talk page.  Best, --[[User:A Nobody|A Nobody]]<sup>''[[User talk:A Nobody|My talk]]''<\/sup> 03:39, 2 January 2009 (UTC)\n*********** Again, resolving the underlying policy dispute is peripheral. Of course people are allowed to dispute policy. This RFC is about his dispute resolution strategy: going beyond removing it once or twice to an outright extended edit war. I think that if Pixelface had an offer that people could live with (e.g.: not outright removing [[WP:PLOT]], but rewriting it), that would go a long way to showing that he had learned not to edit war. But whatever he does, the edit warring needs to stop. You'd be helping everyone if you told him that we respect his viewpoint (even if we disagree), and that he's entitled to advocate for it at talk pages, but that he won't be looked upon kindly if he repeats the disruptive editing for a 14th time. [[User:Randomran|Randomran]] ([[User talk:Randomran|talk]]) 03:47, 2 January 2009 (UTC)\n************I'm under the impression from his talk page as if he is not planning on removing it further and as you can see DGG and I have asked him to go about things differently and he seems responsive to us.  I want to be sure that we don't belabor the point if he's more or less agreeing and wind up putting him in a corner or making him bitter.  Best, --[[User:A Nobody|A Nobody]]<sup>''[[User talk:A Nobody|My talk]]''<\/sup> 03:59, 2 January 2009 (UTC)\n************* After Gavin's edit wars on D&D tags, we put him on a moratorium for three months. He voluntarily agreed to it. I think a three month moratorium (more or less) suggests a remedy that fixes the crime, without \"belaboring the point\". If Pixelface shows a better understanding of what he did wrong than Gavin did, then I think that will help a lot. That's why it's probably best to wait for Pixelface's actual response to the RFC. It will show us whether he has truly learned his lesson, or if he's going to avoid responsibility using the 5Ds (Dodge, Dip, Dive, Duck, Dodge). Any effort to craft a remedy will be premature until we see his response. His editing conduct on redirect pages after the RFC began probably doesn't help him demonstrate a good faith effort to improve. But his words on his talk page offer some hope. [[User:Randomran|Randomran]] ([[User talk:Randomran|talk]]) 04:15, 2 January 2009 (UTC)\n**************He's commented further at [[User_talk:MBisanz#Request_to_unprotect_Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not]].

I think it's fair to assign some blame to other parties such as Sceptre. I wouldn't blame him if he shrugs off some of the other criticisms too. But the fact that he's trying to conflate a long-term edit war with a few reverts worries me. It shows an unwillingness to take any responsibility for [[WP:EDITWAR]]RING at all. But I'm going to assume good faith, and wait until he comments on the RFC directly. [[User:Randomran|Randomran]] ([[User talk:Randomran|talk]]) 04:39, 2 January 2009 (UTC)\n****************Okay.

Shall I put a longer statement in my userspace? --[[User:Pixelface|Pixelface]] ([[User talk:Pixelface|talk]]) 11:59, 2 January 2009 (UTC)\n:It should probably be removed from there; you should make that known in the Response section.

We don't want threaded commentary on the talk page because someone could derail a comment and make it seem to people that a particular comment is more contentious (or, alternately, has more support) than it really does.  You 'get' to reply in the \"response\" section because it gives some priority to your views.  This makes sure that the villagers can't just storm in with torches and pitchforks.  So if you feel that a particular architectural 'rule' in the RfC stops you from mounting your case, [[WP:IAR|ignore it...sparingly]].  As for the talk page, like Masem says, yes.

If, on 30 January, he hasn't responded, we find some neutral editor to write a summary of what this small subset of people feels is the dispute and we tell Pixelface.

This is a slice of people who care strongly about fictional subjects (either way) attempting to (variously), defend pixel, hang him out to dry, or just hammer out the issues on policy pages.

But are people willing to read what I've written without telling me \"tl;dr\" or without calling it a \"rant\" or without saying I have \"wiki-OCD\" &mdash; which people at this RFC have all told me in the past?\n\n:This is a request for comment from other users. No other users have commented on the RFC page in the last 5 days, speaking of lack of response.

If I could rewrite PLOT, it would say:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Please do not create articles that are just plot summaries.

If it's not a copyright violation, if it appears to have been written in an editor's own words, help improve it! Look for sources on Google, Google News, Google Book, or Google Scholar. If a critic or reliable source has written something about the topic, read what they have written, summarize it, add it to the article, and attribute that information to them. Improve pages wherever you can, and do not worry about leaving them [[WP:IMPERFECT|imperfect]]. Try checking the work of fiction out from a library and using it as a source. Articles with just a plot summary really could be [[WP:BETTER|better]]. If you don't have time to improve the article, consider putting a cleanup tag on the article.

You could try templates like {{tl|mergenote}} to notify the editors who have made the most edits to the article, which can be found with [http:\/\/vs.aka-online.de\/cgi-bin\/wppagehiststat.pl this tool]. If you think a merge might be controversial, try suggesting a merge at [[Wikipedia:Proposed merges]]. Endeavour to [[WP:PRESERVE|preserve]] information. Remember that someone else added that information to Wikipedia because they thought it makes Wikipedia better.<br><br>\n\nIf you don't think a merge is appropriate, and you think Wikipedia should not have an article on the topic, and you think Wikipedia readers or websurers are likely to search for the term, consider turning the article into a redirect. Don't go too fast though; Wikipedia wasn't built in a day. It will still be here tomorrow, and hopefully long after everyone here is gone. Wikipedia is a work in progress. Check \"what links here\" in the article's sidebar to see what other pages have wikilinks to the article. Editors of those articles may know something about the topic. If you have read the deletion policy and think the article cannot be improved and needs to be deleted, read what to do [[WP:BEFORE|before]] nominating it for deletion.

[[User talk:MuZemike|MuZemike]] 16:38, 12 January 2009 (UTC)\n\n* As I understand it, this RFC is associated with this particular policy issue, not with Pixelface's general editing behaviour.  The policy issue therefore merits discussion since airing this will help clarify the matter and perhaps point to possible resolutions which would be helpful.  Pixelface's position seems to be that this policy is disputed and does not have consensus support.  I agree with this position.  We have had other editors agree that WP:PLOT is unsatisfactory, such as its original author.  It therefore seems that we really have a content dispute here and resolving this would resolve the matter complained of here.  We should therefore adjourn and resume our efforts to rewrite WP:PLOT. [[User:Colonel Warden|Colonel Warden]] ([[User talk:Colonel Warden|talk]]) 18:09, 12 January 2009 (UTC)\n**Seconded.  The policy issue is what really needs to be resolved.  Best, --[[User:A Nobody|A Nobody]]<sup>''[[User talk:A Nobody|My talk]]''<\/sup> 18:11, 12 January 2009 (UTC)\n**One can dispute a policy or guideline without aggressive and uncivil editing.  ''That'' is the core of the issue, not whether PLOT needs to be modified (as the provided evidence was more than just what happened on WP:NOT).   Sure, if we resolved PLOT to PF's liking, I'm sure their behavior would change, but that's rewarding the wrong behavior. --[[User:Masem|M<font size=\"-3\">ASEM<\/font>]] 18:33, 12 January 2009 (UTC)\n** Copy what Masem said. Yes, a few people are disputing WP:PLOT, and a few people have tried to remove it. But Pixelface is the only person who has gone so far as to actively edit war over it, reverting it an unprecedented 13 times in a few months (give or take). [[User:Randomran|Randomran]] ([[User talk:Randomran|talk]]) 19:15, 12 January 2009 (UTC)\n**This is an RfC on ''user conduct'', not an RfC on ''policy or guideline''. There would be no purpose for this specific RfC had it not been for the questionable conduct by said user. I think suggesting otherwise (which is also an argument that the wrong RfC has been initiated) is an attempt to [[WP:GAME|game the system]] by changing the topic at hand. We must stay on point and discuss, in a constructive manner of course, what we think about the conduct and not what solely what we think about PLOT. [[User talk:MuZemike|MuZemike]] 19:41, 12 January 2009 (UTC)\n\n==Time to close==\nGiven that Arbcom rejected Episodes and characters 3 at this time so that the community could work on a compromise, it is apparent that this request for comment is not serving a constructive purpose at this time and in effect is disrupting that attempts at working towards a compromise.  Pixelface's actions since January 1st seem constructive and that he has heard the critcisms and is now doing what he can to work with the community.  Discussing specific editors at a time when we have a much bigger concern, i.e. working on the fiction compromise, is only augmenting the divisiveness of the community and is providing a distraction of our time and efforts from working together to indeed iron out a compromise.  If we really want to move forward, then we need to stop going after each other and start devoting our time and energy to actually accomplishing something useful.  For the same reason that right now since TTN has not edited since December 26th, it would be a side tracking to keep going on and on about him, I see nothing to be gained by going on and on about Pixelface.  Again, for this month so far, he seems to be making the effort to rein himself in, discuss proactively with myself and Randomran, etc.  We should all be capable of setting aside personal differences and focus where we need our actual focus on.  If we fail to compromise on Fiction and we still see questionable behavior from sepecific editors or if it is apparent that specific editors are trying to sabotage the efforts to compromise, then okay, and then we'll probably wind up with yet another arbcom case, but let us exhaust what we can on the priority at hand and not be side tracked here.  You don't have to like Pixelface or approve of his past to see that we are being distracted here and that if anything such an RfC\/U is only raising rather than lowering tensions.  Sincerely, --[[User:A Nobody|A Nobody]]<sup>''[[User talk:A Nobody|My talk]]''<\/sup> 03:16, 13 January 2009 (UTC)\n: Has he heard the criticisms? I don't see it. Thus far, he hasn't acknowledged any behavioral problem at all. Yes, he's promised to stay away from [[WP:NOT]] for a month. But there is no sign he has any intention of replacing edit warring with consensus-building. In fact, he insisted on having a policy discussion here rather than at [[WP:NOT]], which suggests that he has completely misunderstood this RFC as being a debate about [[WP:PLOT]]. It isn't. This RFC solely about his conduct. It doesn't matter if he was edit warring [[WP:NOT#PLOT]] or [[WP:NOT#PAPER]] -- edit warring is edit warring, and it's unacceptable. I know Pixelface is your friend, and you agree with his viewpoint, but that doesn't give him a free pass for bad behavior. [[User:Randomran|Randomran]] ([[User talk:Randomran|talk]]) 03:51, 13 January 2009 (UTC)\n::It's not about giving anyone a free pass, but about priorities.  Has he edit warred recently?  We sanction people to deter, not to punish.  If he's stopped doing it, then that's that.  Otherwise, every time any of us post here is time that we are not ironing out differences on the Fiction front and I got a good sense from reading the arbitrators that they are postponing Episodes and characters 3 so we can reach a compromise.  Why risk raising tensions or increasing animosity on any of these side issues?  Can we really expect Gavin and Pixelface to join in the compromise while trying to get them sanctioned at the same time?  Sincerely, --[[User:A Nobody|A Nobody]]<sup>''[[User talk:A Nobody|My talk]]''<\/sup> 03:55, 13 January 2009 (UTC)\n::: I agree with you that we sanction people to deter, not to punish. But we can't know if this RFC has had any deterrent effect until we hear what Pixelface has learned in the past month. Thus far, I haven't seen him acknowledge the problem. That doesn't work in his favor. [[User:Randomran|Randomran]] ([[User talk:Randomran|talk]]) 04:02, 13 January 2009 (UTC)\n::::Again, I don't see the rush here; if he is cooperating constructively with the effort to compromise on fiction, I see these sorts of discussions as a detriment to that process.

Best, --[[User:A Nobody|A Nobody]]<sup>''[[User talk:A Nobody|My talk]]''<\/sup> 04:05, 13 January 2009 (UTC)\n::::: No rush. Pixelface has until the end of the month to respond. Most of us had ample time to deal with Gavin and TTN and still discuss policy changes. I don't see this RFC\/U as particularly onerous or time consuming. It's a legitimate problem that deserves a legitimate response. It's in Pixelface's best interest to respond and explain the situation as he sees it. He still has time to figure out what he wants to say.

These things can easily be perceived as witch hunts or as hypocritical and I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't feel as much.  But to be more precise, consider the recent thread he made suggesting a survey on the Fiction status.  Now, think about how you, Masem, and Drilnoth replied, i.e. reasonably, and yet far less maturely or collegialy we also get [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Notability_(fiction)&diff=263611112&oldid=263611095 this response] (notice the edit summary as well as the actual comment).  So, we're going to lecture Pixelface about civility when he gets outright mocked for making a suggestion?  In any event, the RfC\/U is just another factionalizing thing that really doesn't help us all move forward on compromising.  Now, if he were today edit warring against everyone, then okay, but I am not seeing a continued issue at present.

Protonk was quick to defend Pixelface from those who accused him of being a \"vandal\", and wanted us to focus specifically on the edit warring. Others who share Pixelface's viewpoint, such as BOZ and Casliber, have noted that there is a legitimate problem here. Pixelface has a choice in how he wants to handle this. He explain himself, defend himself from the more ridiculous comments, but acknowledge the legitimate complaints. Or he can just [[WP:AGF|assume bad faith]] from me, Protonk, Casliber, BOZ, and ignore it. It's up to him, but breaking our guideline on [[WP:AGF]] probably doesn't reflect well on you when you're already in trouble for [[WP:EDITWAR]]RING. I think a lot of people would agree with that.

Of course, if the cause is something else, we'll address that.  We want this to end up to allow Pixelface to contribute in the best manner possible, and if its something we can figure out how to correct outside of their own actions, that should be identified.

I have no opinion whether it should be removed or noted or not.\n\n:I was looking at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Video games and noticed a thread where Pagrashtak said that user was undoing redirects of character articles (it's archived now [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Video_games&oldid=268405987#Character_merges oldid]). I looked at Akari Kanzaki's user [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Akari_Kanzaki&oldid=266513372 talkpage] and the user had been blocked for edit warring after 2 vandalism warnings. I looked at their contribs, saw they had started editing in November, and saw they were unredirecting Xenosaga articles. I looked at the history of a few of those articles and I kept seeing the same names reverting that user. I saw no merge discussion at Talk:List of characters in the Xenosaga series. Thinking they were a new user, and seeing no merge discussion on that talkpage, and seeing no warnings for reverts on their talkpage, and keeping in mind Pagrashtak's thread at WikiProject Video games, I left a [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Akari_Kanzaki&diff=266663202&oldid=266513372 note] on their talkpage.

With that said, if we're bringing FICT into this, that page is heated all-around and Pixelface is absolutely not making any comments in a vaccuum.

I'd primarily like to deal with Pixelface's editing \"strategy\", rather than his tone of conversation. To the extent that he's making personal attacks and accusing others of bad faith, I think we need a general warning all around.

There are a lot of Wikipedians who are able to look the other way and try to bring things back on topic, instead of feeding the battleground. That said, as much as I don't think we should give Pixelface a free pass on incivility for his gross misunderstanding of how a Wikipedian should conduct himself, I also don't think we should give others a free pass.

On February 16, 2014, it was released on the [[Amazon Appstore]].\n\n== Places ==\nIn Township you have your own city, which you can leave and go to friends city's, at level 30 you can go to isles, once you unlock the port, at level 40 you can build a zoo, and several different levels you can get airplanes and trains. You can also go into a app.{{What|date=March 2016}}\n\n==Gameplay==\nTownship is a city-building game which contains farming elements.<ref>[https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/app\/id638689075 Township for iOS]<\/ref> Players are guided through a brief [[tutorial]] at the very beginning of the game.\nThe player begins with a starter [[town]] and in order to develop it they should harvest [[crop]]s, run processing facilities and sell [[Good (economics)|goods]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Ashby|first=Alicia|title=Township|url=http:\/\/www.gamezebo.com\/2011\/07\/15\/township-review\/|work=Gamezebo}}<\/ref> The primary [[currency]] in the game is T-cash. Besides, the player also earns XP ([[experience point]]s) and [[coin]]s for performing different kinds of actions in the game. Coins are used to buy factories, community buildings, decorations and XP points are used to level up.  As the player accumulates XP points and goes through levels, more kinds of crops, factories, community buildings and decorations become available.\n\n==Crops==\nMost of the [[Production (economics)|production]] comes from crops. The player starts with [[wheat]] but can eventually grow many other kinds of crops. To unlock them the player should grow the town\u2019s [[population]] and level up. Crops can be used in the following ways - it\u2019s possible to sell crops or invest resources in processing them.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fisher|first=Carl|title=Township Review (iOS)|url=http:\/\/gamesbrainsandheadbanging.com\/2014\/06\/04\/township-review-ios\/|work=Games, Brrraaains & A Head-Banging Life}}<\/ref>\n\n==Facilities==\nFactories let players process various crops into other products. As the player levels up more factories become available to be built. \nHouses and Community Buildings help the player increase the population and the population cap in the town, respectively. These facilities can be purchased for coins.\n\n==Social interaction==\nTownship encourages interactions between players through the social network Facebook.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Jerad|title=Playrix Launches Township|url=http:\/\/dailyappshow.com\/playrix-launches-township-for-iphone-ipad-and-ipod-touch|work=Daily App Show}}<\/ref> Keeping in touch with other players allows the player to develop the town faster by using friends\u2019 help.

Your account will be renamed ==\n\n<div class=\"plainlinks mw-content-ltr\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\nHello,\n\nThe developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage\/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.\n\nUnfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called TRUJILLO. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name TRUJILLO~enwiki that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]]. If you think you might own all of the accounts with this name and this message is in error, please visit [[Special:MergeAccount]] to check and attach all of your accounts to prevent them from being renamed.\n\nYour account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.\n\nSorry for the inconvenience.\n\nYours,<br \/>[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]<br \/>Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation\n<\/div> 02:57, 20 March 2015 (UTC)\n<!-- SUL finalisation notification -->\n\n== Renamed ==\n\n<div class=\"plainlinks mw-content-ltr\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\u201d>\nThis account has been renamed as part of [[m:Special:MyLanguage\/Single User Login finalisation announcement|single-user login finalisation]].

This mountain is obscure, while the state park is much more well known.  In addition, the state recently (2008) established a state natural area on the mountain, calling it '''Bear Paw'''.  The SNA's name is based on the mountain's Cherokee name, '''Yonah\u2011wayah''', which means '''Bear's Paw'''.  Given that Bear's Paw is English version of the Cherokee name, and that the mountain is becoming more commonly known as Bear's Paw, due to the SNA, I would like discuss if it makes sense to change this article's name to Bear's Paw.  \u2013[[User:Sparkgap|Sparkgap]] ([[User_talk:Sparkgap|talk]]) 05:19, 14 September 2011 (UTC)\n\n:I was unaware of the name change to the mountain, it is still listed on a lot of maps as Hanging Rock.

The gate of the FGMOS is electrically isolated, creating a floating node in DC, and a number of secondary gates or inputs are deposited above the floating gate (FG) and are electrically isolated from it. These inputs are only [[Capacitive coupling|capacitively]] connected to the FG. Since the FG is completely surrounded by highly resistive material, the charge contained in it remains unchanged for long periods of time. Usually [[Field electron emission#Fowler\u2013Nordheim tunneling|Fowler-Nordheim tunneling]] and [[hot-carrier injection]] mechanisms are used to modify the amount of charge stored in the FG.\n\nSome applications of the FGMOS are digital storage element in [[EPROM]], [[EEPROM]] and [[Flash memory|flash]] memories, neuronal computational element in [[neural network]]s, analog storage element, [[digital potentiometer]]s and single-transistor [[Digital-to-analog converter|DACs]].\n\n==History==\nThe first report of a floating-gate MOSFET was made by Kahng and Sze,<ref>D. Kahng and S.M. Sze, \"A floating-gate and its application to memory devices,\" The Bell System Technical Journal, vol. 46, no. 4, 1967, pp. 1288-1295<\/ref> and dates back to 1967. The first application of the FGMOS was to store digital data in EEPROM, EPROM and flash memories. However, the current interest in FGMOS circuits started from developing large-scale computations in neuromorphic systems, which are inherently analog.\n\nIn 1989 Intel employed the FGMOS as an analog nonvolatile memory element in its {{abbr|ETANN|Electrically trainable artificial neural network}} chip,<ref>M. Holler, S. Tam, H. Castro, and R. Benson, \"An electrically trainable artificial neural network with 10240 'floating gate' synapses,\" Proceeding of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, Washington, D.C., vol. II, 1989, pp. 191-196<\/ref> demonstrating the potential of using FGMOS devices for applications other than digital memory.\n\nThree research accomplishments laid the groundwork for much of the current FGMOS circuit development:\n# Thomsen and Brooke's demonstration and use of electron tunneling in a standard CMOS double-[[Polysilicon|poly]] process<ref>A. Thomsen and M.A. Brooke, \"A floating-gate MOSFET with tunneling injector fabricated using a standard double-polysilicon CMOS process,\" IEEE Electron Device Letters, vol. 12, 1991, pp. 111-113<\/ref> allowed many researchers to investigate FGMOS circuits concepts without requiring access to specialized fabrication processes.\n# The ''\u03bd''MOS, or neuron-MOS, circuit approach by Shibata and Ohmi<ref>T. Shibata and T. Ohmi, \"A functional MOS transistor featuring gate-level weighted sum and threshold operations,\" IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices, vol. 39, no. 6, 1992, pp. 1444-1455<\/ref> provided the initial inspiration and framework to use capacitors for linear computations. These researchers concentrated on the FG circuit properties instead of the device properties, and used either [[Ultraviolet|UV]] light to equalize charge, or simulated FG elements by opening and closing MOSFET switches.\n# Carver Mead's adaptive retina<ref>C.A. Mead and M. Ismail, editors, Analog VLSI Implementation of Neural Systems, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA, 1989<\/ref> gave the first example of using continuously-operating FG programming\/erasing techniques, in this case UV light, as the backbone of an adaptive circuit technology.\n\n==Structure==\n[[Image:Floating gate transistor-en.svg|thumb|A cross-section of a floating-gate transistor]]\nAn FGMOS can be fabricated by electrically isolating the gate of a standard MOS transistor, so that there are no resistive connections to its gate. A number of secondary gates or inputs are then deposited above the floating gate (FG) and are electrically isolated from it. These inputs are only capacitively connected to the FG, since the FG is completely surrounded by highly resistive material. So, in terms of its DC operating point, the FG is a floating node.\n\nFor applications where the charge of the FG needs to be modified, a pair of small extra transistors are added to each FGMOS transistor to conduct the injection and tunneling operations. The gates of every transistor are connected together; the tunneling transistor has its source, drain and bulk terminals interconnected to create a capacitive tunneling structure. The injection transistor is connected normally and specific voltages are applied to create hot carriers that are then injected via an electric field into the floating gate.\n\nFGMOS transistor for purely capacitive use can be fabricated on N or P versions. For charge modification applications, the tunneling transistor (and therefore the operating FGMOS) needs to be embedded into a well, hence the technology dictates the type of FGMOS that can be fabricated.\n\n==Modeling==\n===Large signal DC===\nThe equations modeling the DC operation of the FGMOS can be derived from the equations that describe the operation of the MOS transistor used to build the FGMOS. If it is possible to determine the voltage at the FG of an FGMOS device, it is then possible to express its drain to source current using standard MOS transistor models. Therefore, to derive a set of equations that model the large signal operation of an FGMOS device, it is necessary to find the relationship between its effective input voltages and the voltage at its FG.\n\n===Small signal===\nAn ''N''-input FGMOS device has ''N''\u22121 more terminals than a MOS transistor, and therefore, ''N''+2 small signal parameters can be defined: ''N'' effective input [[transconductance]]s, an output transconductance and a bulk transconductance. Respectively:\n: <math>g_{mi}=\\frac{C_i}{C_T}g_m\\quad\\mbox{for}\\quad i=[1,N]<\/math>\n: <math>g_{dsF}=g_{ds}+\\frac{C_{GD}}{C_T}g_m<\/math>\n: <math>g_{mbF}=g_{mb}+\\frac{C_{GB}}{C_T}g_m<\/math>\nwhere <math>C_T<\/math> is the total capacitance seen by the floating gate. These equations show two drawbacks of the FGMOS compared with the MOS transistor:\n* Reduction of the input transconductance\n* Reduction of the output resistance\n\n==Simulation==\nUnder normal conditions, a floating node in a circuit represents an error because its initial condition is unknown unless it is somehow fixed. This generates two problems: first, it is not straightforward to simulate these circuits; and second, an unknown amount of charge might stay trapped at the floating gate during the fabrication process which will result in an unknown initial condition for the FG voltage.\n\nAmong the many solutions proposed for the computer simulation, one of the most promising methods is an Initial Transient Analysis (ITA) proposed by Rodriguez-Villegas,<ref>Rodriguez-Villegas, Esther. Low Power and Low Voltage Circuit Design with the FGMOS Transistor<\/ref> where the FGs are set to zero volts or a previously known voltage based on the measurement of the charge trapped in the FG after the fabrication process. A transient analysis is then run with the supply voltages set to their final values, letting the outputs evolve normally. The values of the FGs can then be extracted and used for posterior small-signal simulations, connecting a voltage supply with the initial FG value to the floating gate using a very-high-value inductor.\n\n==Applications==\nThe usage and applications of the FGMOS can be broadly classified in two cases. If the charge in the floating gate is not modified during the circuit usage, the operation is capacitively coupled.\n\nIn the capacitively coupled regime of operation, the net charge in the floating gate is not modified. Examples of application for this regime are single transistor adders, DACs, multipliers and logic functions, variable threshold inverters,\n\nUsing the FGMOS as a programmable charge element, it is commonly used for [[non-volatile storage]] such as [[Flash memory|flash]], [[EPROM]] and [[EEPROM]] memory. In this context, floating-gate MOSFETs are useful because of their ability to store an electrical charge for extended periods of time without a connection to a power supply. Other applications of the FGMOS are neuronal computational element in [[neural network]]s, analog storage element and [[Digital potentiometer|e-pots]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[IGBT]]\n* [[MOSFET]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http:\/\/etd.gatech.edu\/theses\/available\/etd-08062006-001021\/unrestricted\/ozalevli_erhan_200612_phd.pdf EXPLOITING FLOATING-GATE TRANSISTOR PROPERTIES IN ANALOG AND MIXED-SIGNAL CIRCUIT DESIGN]\n* [http:\/\/computer.howstuffworks.com\/rom4.htm Howstuffworks \"How ROM Works\"]\n* [http:\/\/www.cs.washington.edu\/homes\/diorio\/Publications\/CoAuthConfPapers\/PaulHasler\/Floatgate_dev.pdf Floating Gate Devices]\n* [http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/3639134109 FLOATING-GATE TRANSISTORS IN ANALOG AND MIXED-SIGNAL CIRCUIT DESIGN]\n* [http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/3836441772 Tunable and reconfigurable circuits using floating-gate transistors]\n\n[[Category:Transistor types]]\n[[Category:MOSFETs]]","timestamp":"20160410104013","user-timestamp":"20150410104013"},{"title":"Template:2008 in Norwegian football","content":"{{Navbox\n| name   = 2008 in Norwegian football\n| title  = [[2008 in Norwegian football]]\n| state  = {{{state|autocollapse}}}\n|listclass = hlist\n| above  = {{align|left| \u00ab {{smaller|[[2007 in Norwegian football|2007]]}} }} {{align|right|{{smaller|[[2009 in Norwegian football|2009]]}} \u00bb }}\n\n| group1 = League competitions\n| list1  =\n* [[2008 Norwegian Premier League|Tippeligaen]]\n* [[2008 Norwegian First Division|1.

It was founded in 1926 by the late Sir [[Tashi Namgyal]], KCSI, KCIE, the 11th consecrated Ruler of [[Sikkim]]. It is an autonomous English-medium, co-educational and residential-cum-day school.\n\n==The Founder==\n[[File:Tashi Namgyal.jpg|thumbnail|left|160px|Sir Tashi Namgyal]]\n'''Sir [[Tashi Namgyal]]''' ([[Sikkimese language|Sikkimese]]: \u0f56\u0f40\u0fb2\u0f0b\u0f64\u0f72\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f62\u0fa3\u0f58\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f92\u0fb1\u0f63\u0f0b; Wylie:'' Bkra-shis Rnam-rgyal'') (October 26, 1893 \u2013 December 2, 1963) was the ruling [[Chogyal]] (King) of [[Sikkim]] from 1914 to 1963. He was the son of [[Thutob Namgyal]].\n\nNamgyal was the 11th ruler of the [[Chogyal|Namgyal dynasty]] of [[Sikkim]], succeeding his half brother [[Sidkeong Tulku Namgyal]], who had ruled from February to December in 1914, till his death from heart failure. Born in [[Tibet]] and crowned by the 13th [[Dalai Lama]], [[Thubten Gyatso]], he was a strong advocate for closer links with India.\n\nHe was married in October 1918 to Kunzang Dechen, and they had 3 sons and 3 daughters. The eldest son died in a plane crash during [[World War II]].<ref>[[John Sack|Sack, John]] (1959). [[Report from Practically Nowhere]]. New York: Curtis Publishing Company. p. 221.<\/ref> On his death he was succeeded as Chogyal by his second son [[Palden Thondup Namgyal]].\n\nDuring his reign, he is known for land reform and free elections.<ref>[[John Sack|Sack, John]] (1959). [[Report from Practically Nowhere]]. New York: Curtis Publishing Company. pp. 221\u2013222.<\/ref> He also favoured closer links between [[Sikkim]], [[India]] and [[Tibet]]. Many people attribute his death to Indian agents.\n\nAbout a decade after his death, his son [[Palden Thondup Namgyal]], the incumbent hereditary [[Chogyal]] was formally deposed to join the [[Indian Union]]. Prime Minister [[Lhendup Dorji]] appealed to [[India]] to change the status of [[Sikkim]] from protectorate to statehood. On May 16, 1975, Sikkim was officially made the 22nd state of the [[Indian Union]].\n\n==The Beginnings==\nTashi Namgyal Academy was founded in 1926 by the late Sir [[Tashi Namgyal]], [[K.C.S.I.|K.C.S.I]]. & [[K.C.I.E.]], the eleventh consecrated Ruler of [[Sikkim]]. The present Academy was shaped out of Sir Tashi Namgyal High School which was affiliated with [[Calcutta University]]. As a High School it was headed by three headmasters at various times, Mr. C.E. Dudley was the first headmaster. He established the school in the military barracks used by troops of [[Sir Francis Younghusband]] in 1903. Mr. A.K. Sarkar took over from Mr. Dudley and Mr. K.L. Kapoor was the last headmaster in the line.\n\nIn 1956, Sir [[Tashi Namgyal]] took a decision to establish a public school in [[Sikkim]]. In April 1956, Mr. V.N. Langer, M.A ([[English language|English]]), M.A. ([[Economics]]), [[LL.B]]. L.T., a Housemaster from [[Daly College]], Indore was offered a post of Principal. He was entrusted with the task of organizing a new school and reorganizing the old one on modern lines, Mr. N.K. Rustumji, [[Indian Civil Service|ICS]], the then [[Dewan]] of [[Sikkim]], was driving force in drawing out plans for a school which was to run on public school lines. Prince [[Palden Thondup Namgyal]], second son of the Founder, along with [[Dewan]] N.K. Rustumji and Mr. V.N. Langer formed an excellent team to reorganize the school on public school lines, and they were the people who were the main architects of Tashi Namgyal Academy. A Governing Body for the administration, management and control of Sir Tashi Namgyal High School, Gangtok was constituted under the Chairmanship of Maharaja Kumar Saheb.\n\nPlans were drawn up first for the additional buildings for the public school and work started on some of these in 1957. The school was blessed by the August visit of Prime Minister, Shri [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] on October 1, 1958 who left behind his impressive remarks as: \u201c''It is a pleasure to visit this school so delightfully situated, young as it is, it has already developed well and the boys are bright and attractive looking. All best wishes for its progress''.\u201d\n\nIn addition to this the then Political Officer of [[Sikkim]] and [[Bhutan]],  [[Apa Saheb Bala Saheb Pant|Shri Apa B. Pant]], too, visited this school on 25 October 1958 and left behind the following comments; \u201c''Whenever I visit this school, I see each time change-change for the better. I am sure that under able guidance of Shri Langer this school will develop into an institution where not only future citizens of Sikkim will learn to serve their country, but where sectarianism, communalism, bigotry, small mindedness, pursuit of power will have no place. Let us hope that this institution will guide the youth of Sikkim to become humane, compassionate and full of spirit of humanity and service and in short to follow Dharma''.\u201d\n\nThe year 1959 was a landmark in the annals of the institution. On the auspicious occasion of the opening of the Annexe of Tashi Namgyal Academy, the main school building on 14 April 1959, His Highness Sir [[Tashi Namgyal]] outlined the reason for which the school was renamed as Tashi Namgyal Academy. He said, \u201cIn the past it has been difficult for children of poor parents to enjoy the advantage of the best possible schooling as they could not afford admission to the more highly organized institution in [[Darjeeling]], [[Kalimpong]] and elsewhere. It has been decided, therefore, to build up an institution in [[Sikkim]] itself which would stand comparison with the best institution of its kind outside the country. This institution would not be a substitute for, but in addition to the normal type of High Schools that has been established in other parts of Sikkim. As, however, the standard of teaching would be of a higher level of a special nature, the institution being designated as an \"Academy\".\n\nIn course of time, when we also have been able to establish, in addition to the Academy the usual pattern of High School in [[Gangtok]], the fees for admission to the Academy will be proportionately raised. But the [[Durbar (court)|Darbar]] will ensure that there will be ample scope for meritorious children of poor parents to gain admission to the Academy on the result of Competitive Scholarship Examinations.\n\nApart from the purpose, this academy will provide a higher quality of schooling within [[Sikkim]] itself, an equally important objective will be to impart a pattern of education particularly suited to special needs of [[Sikkim]]. Our patterns of education should, therefore, be so designed that students will be inspired with love of country and that from this love of country should arise also this view that we have chosen the new motto \u2013 for the Academy \u2013 \u201c''Service Through Knowledge''\u201d. For it is their hope that the knowledge that will be imparted here will be directed, above all, to service, and such service must comprise, above all, service to country.\n\nThe new school crest has been designed on the pattern of traditional [[Sikkim]]ese Art. It portrays the sword that cuts away ignorance, symbolizing knowledge, while the Mountains that form the background are the mountains of the motherland, the sacred peak of [[Khangchendzonga]]. And so its crest too, symbolizes the spirit of the Academy, which is the seeking of knowledge not for its own sake, but for service to country and in the spirit of [[Sikkim]]\u2019s culture and religious heritage.\n\n\u201cIn opening this new Annexe, I express my confident hope that Academy will in due course, rear citizens of whom [[Sikkim]] will have reason to be proud, that it will grow in stature and gain in luster as the cradle of [[Sikkim]]\u2019s future generations and so the moulder of her destiny.\u201d\n\nMaharaja Kumar [[Palden Thondup Namgyal]], the Chairman of the Governing Body, on the occasion of the opening of the Annexe said, \u201c''The Principal objective of the Darbar has been to provide education that will be consistent both with the culture, heritage and economic conditions of Sikkim. So that youths of Sikkim may grow into people with love for one\u2019s country and heritage and useful citizens of Sikkim''\u201d.\n\nIn May 26, 1959, the Rules concerning Departmental procedures of the Academy and in December 24, 1959 Financial and Administrative Powers of the Principal were defined.\n\nWith the additional buildings and a defined campus, the Junior Section was started with classes from [[Kindergarten]] to class III. Increase in students roll necessitated another hostel in the two-storied building then known as Northern Block, half for [[People of Nepal|Nepali]] boarders and half for [[Bhutia]]-[[Lepcha people|Lepcha]] boarders with a dining hall at the site now occupied by [[Science]] Block with separate kitchens for [[People of Nepal|Nepali]] and [[Bhutia]]-[[Lepcha people|Lepcha]] boys. The old junior school block where Lower [[Kindergarten]] classes were held then served as the Hall with a capacity of approximately 300 people with a low stage.\n\nIn October 1961, the Auditorium was opened with a seating capacity of 600 built at a cost of Rs. 3 Lakhs. The same year the school was upgraded to the Higher Secondary Level (Class XI) and the first batch passed out in 1964. In May 1964, another New Hostel was added across the Football field (the present Boys\u2019 Hostel), the campus was demarcated with two main gates, the upper Gate and the Main Lower Gate, and both built in traditional [[Sikkim]]ese architecture.\n\nIn 1964 the idea of reorganizing Tashi Namgyal Academy on public school lines as coeducational institution was implemented. It was decided to have in the beginning only seven classes starting from Kindergarten to VI as the highest class and then to go on adding one higher class every year till it reached class XI, the Final School Certificate Stage. This policy, it was hoped, would enable to build up an institution in which even through medium of instruction and the first language English it would remain [[Sikkim]]ese in its tradition and culture.\n\nIt was decided to follow the outline approved for the Anglo-Indian schools. A school uniform had been designed and selection of textbooks done. The first prospectus was published in 1965 and admissions to various classes of the public school were declared open simultaneously. Posts of teachers were advertised in the leading newspapers and tenders for uniforms were invited from local dealers. In March 1966, Tashi Namgyal Academy was reorganized along Public School lines with English as the medium of instruction and the first language. This idea led to the shifting of Sir Tashi Namgyal Higher Secondary School to the Development Area in Gangtok, along with approximately 14 members of teaching staff and majority of students especially from classes VII and above.\n\nFacilities for all round development of the faculties through large variety of cultural activities were provided. There were hobbies such as [[painting]], [[woodcraft]], [[leather work]], [[dance]], [[drama]], [[music]], [[sewing]] and [[knitting]]. The major games played were [[Football (soccer)|football]], [[volleyball]], [[hockey]], [[netball]], [[baseball]] and [[cricket]].\n\nSome of the elder staff of Higher Secondary School who had been retained, gallantly rose to meet the pressing demands of the situation. Mrs. Langer, wife of the Principal, Mr. V.N. Langer, took over the responsibility of organizing the hostel and its routine so that it may be ready to receive the boarders when they come a day before the start of the session in March 1966. Altogether 130 students were on roll (both boys and girls), more than what was expected in the first year and more than what could be managed by the available staff. As days rolled by the staffing problem was solved to some extent. A new matron took over charge of the Hostel leaving Mrs. Langer free to devote herself to teaching work, two more teachers were appointed, one for additional section of K.G. class and the other to teach [[English language|English]] to senior classes. A programme for weekly terminal tests also was drawn out and monthly and terminal reports made their appearance.<ref>Deja Vu : The TNA Alumni Magazine<\/ref><ref>Tashi Namgyal Academy: [http:\/\/tnasikkim.com\/about-history.html The Beginnings]<\/ref>\n\n==Aims and objectives==\n\nThe institution aims to provide sufficient academic knowledge for a child to be able to meet the standards required to complete his college course without much strain. The child must possess a healthy disposition to life, a reasoning mind and an attitude of service. He must not be divorced from the social order and show good sportsmanship, be creative, unselfish and courageous. He should not be afraid of truth and justice and have sufficient pride for his country's culture and heritage. He should not be afraid to face unpopularity or to maintain an independent opinion. He should show friendliness, good manners and temper his emotions, showing discipline and responsibility.\n\n==Campus==\n\nThe school has a rectangular-shaped compound, measuring about {{convert|12|acre|m2}} bound by the National Highway ([[National Highway 31A (India)|NH-10]]) to [[Nathula]] in the southwest and the road leading to [[Raj Bhavan (Sikkim)|Raj Bhavan]] in the northeast.\n\nStarting from the Upper Main Gate down to the Lower Main Gate there is an open air-theatre, [[football ground]], [[swimming pool]], principal\u2019s bungalow, three multi-storey buildings, 27 single and double unit staff quarters spread all over the school campus, two hostels for boys, one hostel for girls including hostel staff quarters, one kitchen and a hostel dining hall, a large auditorium with a capacity of 600 including a gallery, seven double\/three-storey buildings for classrooms, [[Science]] Block (previously consisting of laboratories for [[Physics]], [[Chemistry]], [[Biology]] and [[Home Science]], now shifted to the new Annexe Block since 2006), Common Rooms, Workshops and an Administrative Block.\n\nThere is one [[greenhouse]] for cultivation of orchids and rare species of plants and facing it is a children\u2019s park. The school has a library with over 25,000 books. There are three athletic fields, one each for [[Football (soccer)|Football]], [[Volleyball]], [[Basketball]] and well laid out flower beds, sprawling lawns and green slopes spread all over the campus. It is adorned with pine and eucalyptus trees. The month of December sees the whole of campus turning pink with cherry blossoms.\n\n==The House System==\nThe [[House system]] at Tashi Namgyal Academy was introduced at the very inception to promote healthy competition amongst students. The House flags with their respective emblems were designed at a later date. The four Houses are Yuksam House, Zongri House, Phensong House and Karponang House.<ref name=\":0\">Tashi Namgyal Academy: [http:\/\/tnasikkim.com\/academic-houses.html The House System]<\/ref>\n\n===Yuksam House===\nYuksam House is named after the historical site in [[West Sikkim district|West Sikkim]] where in 1642 AD. three Lamas from [[Tibet]]; Lhatsun Namkha Jigme Namgyal, Kathoke Sampa Chenpo and Ngadak Rinzing Chenpo met and crowned the first [[Chogyal]] ([[Dharma Raj]]) Phuntsok Namgyal, in accordance with the prophecy by [[Guru Rinpoche]].<ref name=\":0\" \/>\n\n===Zongri House===\nZongri House is named after a mountain top just on the way to the [[Khangchendzonga]] base camp from where the entire [[Khangchendzonga]] massif is visible. It also lies in West [[Sikkim]]. The meaning of the word is derived from the words -'Zong' meaning fort and 'Ri' -meaning Hill.<ref name=\":0\" \/>\n\n===Phensong House===\nPhensong House is named after a place on the way to [[Mangan, India|Mangan]], the District Headquarters of [[North Sikkim district|North Sikkim]]. The word is derived from the words ''phen'' \u2212 meaning ''benefit'' and ''song'' meaning ''excellence''. The [[Monastery]] at Phensong attracts many visitors.<ref name=\":0\" \/>\n\n===Karponang House===\nKarponang House is named after a place in [[East Sikkim district|East Sikkim]] on the way to the [[Nathula]] Pass. The original place name, according to its local history, is derived from a distortion of ''Nang Karpo''. During the [[British expedition to Tibet|Younghusband Expedition]] to Tibet of 1903\u20131904, on seeing a white-coloured house a [[British people|British]] officer exclaimed \"Karpo Nang!\" ''Karpo'' means ''white'', and ''Nang'' means ''house'', so this can be literally translated as white house.<ref name=\":0\" \/>\n\n==The TNA way==\n\n===School song===\n\n====Lyrics====\n\nLearning to serve,<br>\nAn' smilin' as we serve,<br>\nis the TNA way.<br>\nTNA, TNA, TNA, our TNA, our TNA.\n\nLots of fun an' lots of joy,<br>\nLots of work an' lots of play,<br>\nis the TNA way.<br>\nTNA, TNA, TNA, our TNA, our TNA.\n\nKnowledge is our sword,<br>\nAn' Khorlo our deeds,<br>\nWith lotus-like hearts,<br>\nDo we pray, do we pray, do we pray,<br>\nThe TNA way, the TNA way.\n\nThat we may all attain,<br>\nThe glory an' the height,<br>\nThe granite, grit an' pride,<br>\nof Khangchendzonga, of Khangchendzonga,<br>\nWe pray, that we may, that we may, TNA way.<br>\nTNA, TNA, TNA, our TNA, our TNA.\n\nLearning to serve,<br>\nAn' smilin' as we serve,<br>\nis the TNA way.<br>\nTNA, TNA, TNA, our TNA, our TNA.\n\n====Vision====\nEvery path is a challenge which leads to a destination as pristine and as mighty as the sacred [[Khangchendzonga]], [[Sikkim]] is Magic Mountain, and the crown of our country.
