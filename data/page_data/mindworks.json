It has only ...\"","content":"3D printing uses 3D digital models to create solid fixtures by printing layer upon layer of plastic material. \n3D printing has been around since the mid 1980\u2019s. It has only became practical in the past seven to eight years as 3D printers have come down in price.  The University of Idaho uses 3D printing to rapid prototype plastic parts to be used in student projects. Currently the University has two 3D printers available for use, the BST 1200 and MakerBot Replicator 2.\n\n==Differences==\n\n==Makerbot==\n\n==BST 1200==\n\nThe old 3D printer (BST 1200) at University of Idaho was tens of thousands for the machine and ten dollars a cubic inch for printing material.  The new 3D printer (Makerbot) was a few thousand to purchase and is one dollar a cubic inch for printing material. \n'''\nIMAGES!!!\n'''\nThe change in costs came down significantly for several reasons. First, as 3D printing becomes more popular mass production lowers the cost of the machine. Also, new improvements in manufacturing technologies make the printers less to produce because the components are easier to make and more common in other machines. The newer machines also fill the missed market of midrange quality printers that was being ignored. However, the biggest change in price is the material being used. Instead of using Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic like the BST 1200, Makerbot uses Polylactic acid (PLA) plastic.\nMakerbot does not have the quality of the BST 1200. This is because of the property differences in the material and the quality of the machines. A good example of this is the smoothness that parts made with the BST 1200 have. Parts from Makerbot can only as smooth if sanding is done after the printing process. \nMakerbot also does not build arches and overhangs well. BST 1200 uses a separate type of plastic to support arches and overhangs. The support material can be broken off fairly easily. Makerbot can provide supports by printing thin sections of PLA, but this results in a fairly rigid print that will need a great deal of post print sanding.\nOverall the older high-end machines are still better at making precision parts, but the new lower cost machines will fulfill the everyday needs of a typical user. It safe to think of the older machines as a new car. They are reliable, always do what you want, and don\u2019t take any tinkering but cost quite a bit to buy and maintain. The new low cost machine are more like buying a classic car. They aren\u2019t as reliable, only sometime preform as intended, and take some tinkering to make work right, but they are less to purchase, maintain and cool to show off to your friends.\n3D Printing Developed Description\n3D printers work by taking computer generated code and laying plastic down in layers to build a solid 3D model. \n \nCode generation via ReplicatorG\nThe code is generated by a computer program that takes the coordinates of the 3D model and slices it into layers across the Z axis. It then calculate the areas to be filled for the XY plane for each layer.  To conserve plastic, the machine will automatically hollow the object and create a support structure system in the hollowed space.\nWhen read by the machine, the code provides the XY coordinates of where to lay plastic. \n \nIn Progress Print on Makerbot 3D Printer\nBefore the machine can begin its print it has to be set up, this includes verifying the tray is level and waiting for the machine to heat up. Preheating is necessary for the part to be built properly. After the code is loaded and preheating is done; the machine can begin its print.\nPrinting is accomplished by moving a hot needle across the print table with two stepper motors. The motors are controlled by the printer\u2019s computer unit so their location is always known. This process is works like a typical CNC machine. The needle that lays the plastic controls its flow based on the temperature. Only in advanced systems will the temperature change after the preheat is done. \n \nFinished 3D Print\nOnce the first layer is complete, a third stepper motor moves the print table down across the Z so the next layer can print. This process is repeated for each layer until the part is complete.  \nFinished parts typically come out rougher than desired. To get the part to meet a tolerance sanding, drilling and other machining processes can be done","timestamp":"20130529224648","user-timestamp":"20130528175121","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"1","title":"3D_Printing","comment":"Created page with \"OWNER: Michael Moreno\"","content":"OWNER:

Printing with higher resolution can help, but it can add a lot of print time. To achieve precision and smoothness while avoiding extra time, after the print is done it can be machined. \n\n==Milling==\nParts made in MakerBot can be milled in the shop to bring them within tolerance and to create smooth surfaces. Speeds for milling PLA plastic are similar to aluminum and aluminum speeds can be used. \n\n==Drilling And Tapping==\n\n===Drilling and Reaming===\nTo make a hole precise for sliding and press fit the finished part can be reamed. If a hole is intended to be reamed it needs to be .005\u201d smaller in diameter when designing the part for Makerbot.  The Gcode should be set for \"2\" shells.\n\nReaming should be done on the drill press so the ream will find the hole.  \n\n===Tapping===\nPLA can be tapped so long as the shell thickness has been set to \"2\". Tapping is done the same way it would be in metal. Be careful when tapping hole because PLA is soft and will strip easily.\n\n==Sanding==\nParts can be sanded with the belt sander to create smooth sides. Parts can also be sanded by hand, but this typically results in more rough parts than are started with.","timestamp":"20130530233336","user-timestamp":"20130528175121","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Broach_Bushing.png","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20130530233544","user-timestamp":"20130530215806","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Broach.png","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20130530233559","user-timestamp":"20130530215806","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Linear_Broach.png","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20130530233612","user-timestamp":"20130530215806","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Finished.png","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20130530234318","user-timestamp":"20130530215806","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"10","title":"Stub","comment":"Created page with \"This article is a [[stub]].

Our Logan lathes were acquired in 1960. They are due for replacement when funds become available. New lathes would have variable speed spindles and digital readout systems.<ref>Russ Porter<\/ref>\n\n==Anatomy==\n[[File:Full Anatomy of Logan 6561 Lathe.png|400px|thumb|Component Callout, see text to left for detailed description]]\nThere are many types of lathes, some with more components than others, but they all have a headstock, tailstock, and carriage.\n\n===Headstock===\nThe main part of the lathe is referred to as the headstock which typically includes a spindle and drive plate, high and low speed selector(s) [[Changing Between High and Low Speeds (Manual Lathe)|(See: Changing Between High and Low Speeds)]], spindle speed selector [[Changing Speed (Manual Lathe)|(See: Changing speed of manual lathe)]] and tapping\/power feed speed controls [[Changing Tapping and Power Feed Speed (Manual Lathe)|(See: Changing Tapping and Power Feed Speed)]]. A chuck, which holds the working material, is attached to the drive plate.\n\n====Chuck====\nThere are three main types of chucks used on a lathe. A three jaw chuck which is the most common and most often used because of its ability to clamp material quickly. Most lathes will have three jaw chucks in at least two sizes, a larger size for everyday use and a smaller high speed chuck which is capable of higher speeds. The second type of chuck is a four jaw chuck. Four jaw chucks are used for the holding of non-round material, and non-concentric turning. Unlike a three jaw chuck, all four jaws are adjusted independently, and such a dial indicator must be used when chucking material [[Four Jaw Chuck|(See: Zeroing Parts in Four Jaw Chuck)]]. The third type of chuck is a collet chuck. Collet chucks are used when greater contact area is need for holding the part, as well as having the advantages of quicker chucking when producing multiple copies of the same part. For more information on chucks, see [[Swapping Lathe Chuck]]\n\n\n{| style=\"width:50%;\"\n|-\n| [[File:3-Jaw-chuck.png|thumb|Three Jaw Chuck]]\n| [[File:4-Jaw-chuck.png|thumb|Four Jaw Chuck]]\n| [[File:Collet Chuck.jpg|thumb|Collet Chuck]]\n|}\n[[File:Detail Anatomy of Logan 6561 Lathe.png|400px|thumb|Component Callout, see text to left for detailed description]]\n====Jaws====\nThere are two main types of jaws, the standard jaw, and the soft jaw. Standard jaws typically have a 'wide side' used for general purpose turning which provide a large clamping surface over a wide diameter range. The jaws often can be removed and reinserted backwards so that the 'stepped side' of the jaw is facing inwards. While this is true of the CNC HAAS, the Logan's have a second set of jaws, kept in the cabinet. Soft jaws start out as aluminum blanks that can be machined to an exact diameter to result in excellent contact surface with reduced possibility of marking parts. While soft jaws require more setup time their advantages can be critical.\n\n===Tailstock===\nThe tailstock is an assembly which is capable in moving in the z direction and is typically composed of a telescoping shaft which accepts tapered collets, a lock handle to fix the position, and a handle for actuation. The tailstock is commonly used for drilling operations, as well as holding long work pieces for stabilization purposes in a live\/dead center.\n\n===Carriage===\nThe carriage is the primary means of working on a lathe and is typically comprised of the cross feed, x-feed, threading dial indicator, threading controls [[Cutting Threads (Manual Lathe)| (See: Cutting Threads on a Manual Lathe)]], power feed controls [[Use of Power Controls (Manual Lathe)|(See: Using the Power Controls)]], a tool changer [[Changing Tools (Lathes)|(See: Changing Lathe Tools)]].\n<br\\>\n<br\\>\n<br\\>\n<br\\>\n<br\\>\n<br\\>\n\n==Overview of Lathe Tools==\n[[File:Lathe Operations.png|400px|right|Types of operations]]\nPut below into a table (with links if necessary:\n*Boring Bar\n*Face off tool\n*Parting tool\n*Turning tool\n*Threading tools\n*Radius Tools\n*what else?\n\n==Lathe Changeovers==\n*[[Swapping_Lathe_Chuck|Changing the chuck]]\n*Adjusting speed (including low and high gears)\n*Setup for power feed and threads\n*Using the magnetic dial indicators\n*Use of tailstock\n\n==References==\n<references\/>\n\n[[Category:Machine_Shop_(General)]]","timestamp":"20130612011522","user-timestamp":"20130517000614","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Snippets:10_bit_rotary_magnetic_encoder_(AS5040)","comment":"Created page with \"blah\"","content":"blah","timestamp":"20130613191010","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"10_bit_rotary_magnetic_encoder_(AS5040)","comment":"Created page with \"   [[Category:Snippets]]\"","content":"\n\n\n[[Category:Snippets]]","timestamp":"20130613194101","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"14","title":"Snippets","comment":"Created page with \"{{WIP}}  This is going to be a sweet page.

Eight thermocouples were placed to measure the case and internal air temperature at different depths. This information will be useful in preventing the probe's internal components from heating past their operating ranges. \n\n[[File: Experiment tube.png|Experiment tube w marks.png]]\n\nThe data shows the the internal surface temperatures are higher then their outside counter parts. If the ground is treated as a heat sink that is the expected result. Also the lower into the ground, the lower the temperature, which is also expected since the heat source is above the ground. \n\n[[File: Experiment data.png|Experiment data.png]]\n\n[[Category:Senior design]]","timestamp":"20130730183050","user-timestamp":"20130530173611","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Outer_case_test","comment":"Created page with \"[[File:Outer_Case_Experiement.png|Outer_Case_Experiement.png|700px|]]  '''Outer Case Shape Design Decisions'''  After running experiments with many different shapes and design...\"","content":"[[File:Outer_Case_Experiement.png|Outer_Case_Experiement.png|700px|]]\n\n'''Outer Case Shape Design Decisions'''\n\nAfter running experiments with many different shapes and designs we ended up going with the dig and place method for ground installation. There were faster installation times during our experiments from the pound in wedge shape and the screw shape. However, neither of these designs seemed like they would work well. The screw shapes main issue was turning up the soil around the case which wouldn't work well for the probes going into normally packed untouched soil. The wedge shape\u2019s main issue was isolating the internal components from the force of being pounded in. After pounding in a wooden analogue to the case we realized that we were going to have to hit it too hard to keep from breaking it. Another issue with the wedge was not knowing how it affected the soil around it after it was pounded into the ground.\n \n\nWith the dig and place method chosen for the method of installation we then decided that the round cylinder shape for the outer case was the logical choice. With this choice the user would be able to use an auger or a post-hole digger to make a round hole to easily install the probe. Also, using a round digger with a non-round hole would make probe installation difficult.","timestamp":"20130730184320","user-timestamp":"20130530173611","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"IMG_20130612_131014_665.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20130731204508","user-timestamp":"20130624193204","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"RAD_22_Nov_2009_037.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20130731210302","user-timestamp":"20130624193204","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Final_Render_2013.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20130801174501","user-timestamp":"20130624193136","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Thermocouple1.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20130801232113","user-timestamp":"20130530173611","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Raspberry_PI_Clocks.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20130802071944","user-timestamp":"20130624193136","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Arduino_Clocks.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20130802072011","user-timestamp":"20130624193136","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Case_Render.png","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20130802075026","user-timestamp":"20130624193136","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Case_Rendering.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20130802080244","user-timestamp":"20130624193136","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Case_Rendering2.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20130802080310","user-timestamp":"20130624193136","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Case_Rendering3.png","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20130802080326","user-timestamp":"20130624193136","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Admin_Page","comment":"Created page with \"This page is used by the site's admins to keep track of tasks.

The rigid members of the tensegrity structure (such as the PVC members in the above prototype) are in compression, while the tensile members (the paracord) are in tension. Because all elements of the tensegrity structure are in pure compression or tension, no bending moment is ever applied to the structure, creating exceptionally resilient structures that are also very lightweight.\n\nThe goal of our team at the University of Idaho is to create a 6 or 12 strut spherical tensegrity robot that can withstand a 30 foot drop. In the second half of our project, our group plans to add actuators to the robot to roll the robot by adjusting string lengths. By the conclusion of our project, we hope to have a spherical tensegrity robot that can both withstand a 30 foot drop and move in a controlled fashion. We also will have full documentation and computer simulation of our design.\n\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><div style=\"clear: both\">\ufffd<\/div><\/div>\n----\n<div id=\"footer\">\n\n(c) 2008 University of Idaho.

It will significantly decrease the cycle time from on to off and allow for analysis of heater performance during testing.\n\n=Hottesters=\n\n*Ahmed Al Harbi\n**Senior, Electrical Engineering\n*Joe Eckroat\n**Senior, Mechanical Engineering\n*Neal Joslyn\n**Senior, Mechanical Engineering\n*Archana Shrestha\n**Senior, Electrical and Computer Engineering\n*Joe White\n**Senior, Mechanical Engineering\n\n\n=Problem Definition=\n\n==Background<ref>Problem definition supplied by client<\/ref>==\nThe R&D lab at Hotstart is charged with testing new product designs for a wide range of markets that use diesel engines.  During this testing process, a way to ensure product reliability in a short period of time is needed.  Long term testing (1 year +) is not always a feasible option before releasing a product, so a way to speed up this test to the span of a month or two is necessary.  \n\nHotstart manufactures two main types of coolant heaters. The first is a tank heater that uses the heat generated by the heating elements to force the hot coolant out of the top of the system into the engine while the colder coolant coming from the engine takes the place of the heated coolant in the bottom heater creating continuous flow (thermosyphon).  The other style is forced circulation, where a pump is used to circulate the coolant across the heating elements and throughout the engine.  Both styles use a bimetal snap-action thermostat to control the heating elements keeping the coolant inside the desired temperature range.\n\n==Design Requirements==\nLife cycle tester will:\n*Run on 120V input voltage\n*Be capable of safely handling up to 12kW of heating input\n*Be able to simultaneously test 12 heaters (1kW or lower due to previous requirement)\n*Have adjustable temperature setting for both the upper and lower temperature \n*Have adjustable flow settings if a heat transfer fluid is utilized\n*Allow for multiple voltage sources to power the heaters (1 or 3 phase, 120 \u2013 690V)\n*Display or make available easily, critical data for each test \u201cstation\u201d including, but not limited to: cycle count, power failure, heater failure, inlet and outlet temperatures \n*Be made from electrical components that are rated for at least 100k cycles at 50\u00b0C ambient or mitigate ambient conditions for components that are not properly rated\n*Use components sourced from Hotstart\u2019s current vendors unless absolutely not available\n*Contain all foreseeable spills automatically\n*Be complete with all documentation along with a manual and troubleshooting guide.  If a PLC is used, all documented code must be provided\n*Contain all branch circuit protection for all 12 heaters according to UL508A (We may need a supplier to build this part of the panel in order to get the proper sticker inside)\n\nIf Possible, the cycle tester will:\n*Be easily moveable\n*Be capable of testing coolant, oil, and air heaters\n*Be capable of simultaneously running multiple tests with different parameters and set points\n*Be capable of storing and outputting the test data in .csv (or comparable) format\n\n==Design Features==\n*Cycle counter\n*Inlet\/outlet temperature readings\n*Status Lights to show:\n**Current cycle condition (on,off)\n**Any malfunctions in the system\n*Possible Bluetooth\/Wi-Fi connectivity so the user can monitor status from a remote computer\n*Emergency shutoff in the case of a blow-out or other malfunction\n*Ability to digitally record temperatures for performance analysis\n\n=Design=\n\n==Prototypes and testing==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n\n|- \n| {{RowPicture|fileName=1stProto1.jpg|caption=1st Prototype|description=\"Sandbox\" prototype. Using a cooler full of water, cheap hoses, and some sealant, we were able to roughly simulate the conditions a heater would experience in the field. This prototype allowed us to learn a lot about hose positioning and how to achieve proper thermo-siphoning behavior.}}\n\n|- \n| {{RowPicture|fileName=2ndProto1.jpg|caption=2nd Prototype|description=This prototype was used to test whether or not a valve could be used to prevent cold water from reaching the heater until it finishes a heating cycle. We learned that without water flowing past the thermostat in the heater, the heater will not turn off. During testing, the heater boiled the water and was turned off before it became dangerous. }}\n\n|- \n| {{RowPicture|fileName=3rdProto1.jpg|caption=3rd Prototype|description=Our 3rd prototype uses a small \u201ccirculation\u201d tank so that proper thermo-siphoning can be achieved there is no danger of boiling the water. The tank is small enough that cycle times can still be kept very short. When the heater has heated the volume of water, the system is flushed with water from a separate tank, and the cycle can start over. \n\nFrom this prototype we learned that there must be a breather tube on the small tank in order for air bubbles to escape the heater loop. We also learned that, to reduce volume, the small tank can be eliminated altogether.\n }}\n\n|- \n| {{RowPicture|fileName=20130906 145430.jpg|caption=Top-mounted thermostat|description=In order to further reduce cycle times of the engine heaters, we built a top-mounted thermostat. Because heat rises, the bottom mounted thermostat was not able to detect temperature changes quickly enough, which left us with huge temperature gradients in the system. \n\nThis design allows for much faster cycle times and less temperature variability in the heater loop. It also utilizes the original thermostat (stock from heater) for simplicity. Future designs will enable quick installation and removal via the use of copper fins which will easily mount to the thermostat. \n }}\n\n|}\n\n==Current design==\n{|\"width = 100%\"\n|-\n|[[File:Current_Design_7-28-2013.jpg]]\n|}\n\nThis design uses three cells that can operate at independent temperatures. Each cell can be used to test four 1kW heaters at once.\n\n===Design components===\n*Cold reservoir: A refrigeration unit keeps a 10 gallon tank of coolant at a constant temperature (the colder the better)\n*Heater reservoir: Each cell contains a heater reservoir which is used to supply coolant to each heater in that cell at a desired temperature (colder than 100F)\n*Heat exchangers: A plate & frame heat exchanger is used to exchange heat between the heater tank and cold tank for each cell\n**The cold side is supplied by the cold reservoir and is pumped in series through all heat exchangers. Because of this design feature, the coldest temperature set point should be chosen closest to the cold reservoir. \n**The hot side is supplied by a pump connected to the heater reservoir. The pumps will only be used to keep the coolant in the heater reservoir within the limits of the specified temperature, for example 70F +-2F\n*Heating cycle: Each heater will heat a small volume of coolant in a closed loop until the coolant reaches 120F. At this point, solenoid valves will open the loop and allow coolant from the reservoir to flush the loop, and the cycle starts over.\n*Pressurized rails: Each cell uses a pump to pressurize a 'rail' of fluid which is used to flush a heater at the end of its cycle. There is a small pressure relief or recirculation line, which also aids in the mixing of the fluid in the reservoir.\n*Valve control: Each valve in the system will be controlled by a master controller. The valves in the heating cycle loops will open or close depending on the status of the heater (on\/off).\n*Test information: Each heater station will contain the following information:\n**Cycle count\n**Heater Status (on\/off)\n**Inlet\/outlet temperatures\n**Emergency\/error light\n\n=References=\n<references\/>\n\n[[Category:Capstone design]]","timestamp":"20130917225938","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"MechEngrGear.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20130918053422","user-timestamp":"20130624193235","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"LionelHampton.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20130918053910","user-timestamp":"20130624193235","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"TheatreArts.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20130918054100","user-timestamp":"20130624193235","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"NaturalResources.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20130918054358","user-timestamp":"20130624193235","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"ArtAndArch.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20130918054743","user-timestamp":"20130624193235","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"BizAndEcon.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20130918055142","user-timestamp":"20130624193235","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Wiki_Workshop","comment":"Created page with \"==Creating a log in== #click ''Create account'' on the upper right hand corner #username should be the prefix of your vandal email #email should be your vandal email #complete...\"","content":"==Creating a log in==\n#click ''Create account'' on the upper right hand corner\n#username should be the prefix of your vandal email\n#email should be your vandal email\n#complete form and click ''Create account''\n\n==Setup Account==\n#log in\n#click on your name in the upper left hand corner\n#Click on the create tab\n#Add your name and email to the page\n#Post comment:\n#click [[User:Alex7832|here]] and add your signature under you project name by typing four tildas: <nowiki>~~~~<\/nowiki>","timestamp":"20130918205212","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"12","title":"General_Information","comment":"Created page with \"  ==Purpose== This wiki was created to address some limitations of the current [http:\/\/www.webs1.uidaho.edu\/mindworks\/ Mindworks website], mainly: *increase accessibility to b...\"","content":"\n\n==Purpose==\nThis wiki was created to address some limitations of the current [http:\/\/www.webs1.uidaho.edu\/mindworks\/ Mindworks website], mainly:\n*increase accessibility to both users (through QR  codes) and contributes\n*standardize formatting and content\n*increased functionality of materials\n\n\nThe wiki was originally proved using the kaizen project for the summer 2013 Lean Manufacturing course, but has also been envisioned for:\n*senior design teams\n*postings for internships\/jobs\/scholarships\/research positions\n*provide a living document for ongoing research\n*display professors' area of research and equipment\/capabilities\n\n==Creating\/Setting up your log in==\nSee [[Wiki Workshop]]\n\n==Page exemplars==\nKaizen project: [[Cutter_Types_(Mill)]], [[Manual lathe (Logan)]]\n\nSnippet: [[10_bit_rotary_magnetic_encoder_(AS5040)]]\n\nSenior design: [[Band-Beesten_rolling_drum_set]]\n\nResearch: NA\n\n==Organization of site==\nCurrently the site has three categories: Senior design, Snippets, and Kaizen projects.

We interviewed him to learn more about the 2012 design and to get any suggestions that he may have for improving this year's model. The following are the from this interview:\n\n:'''Omni-Wheels:'''\n::*Single omni-wheels were used because he wanted a constant contact surface on the ball for the drive system, which also reduced the cost.\n::*Since our drive system is primarly provided by the user (passive ball interaction), we should be able to use double wheels\n::*Suggested exploring other omni-wheel configurations and testing to see what is most efficient\/easy to pull and push. Such as:\n:::*Pointing toward the middle of the ball\n:::*Perpendicular to the middle of the ball (2012 configuration)\n\n:'''Transfer Casters:'''\n::*Mentioned as a possible replacement option as contact on the ball\n::*Need to make sure that they are invertable (ball down), which was an issue on the 2012 design\n\n:'''Frame Construction:'''\n::*Recommended a more rigid frame to prevent leg bending\n::*The \u0093spring\u0094 action of the 2012 design \u0093soaked up\u0094 some of the input force\n::*A more rigid frame would mean that there would be less force necessary to move the product\n\n:'''Weight Reduction Tips:'''\n::*Acrylic drums are much heavier than wood\n::*If LEDs are going to be used, use external fixtures instead of internal\n::*Cymbal hardware and drum clamps are very heavy and could use a redesign\n::*The large clamps that held the frame together weighed 2 - 3 pounds apiece\n\n===Interview with Denise Bauer===\nDr. Bauer is a Mechanical Engineering professor with an emphasis in Human Factors. As an expert in ergonomics we decided to interview her to learn how to connect the drummer comfortably to the Beest. The following are tips from the interview:\n\n:'''Operational Factors'''\n::*Individual's center of gravity varies, even with similar heights\n::*A few differences between male and females users should be noted\n:::*Center of gravity - The average male has a higher CoG than the average female\n:::*Strength - The average male is stronger than the average female\n::*User comfort is very important, create a mock-up then test it with the potential users to get feedback\n:::*Develop a rating scale to measure comfort\/pain as well as effort needed to operate it\n\n:'''General Facts'''\n::*Getting in and out of the apparatus needs to be simple\n::*Most products on the market are designed for the 95th percentile male\n::*The lower body can produce more power than the upper body\n:::*Since the upper body is weaker, using it to push a machine may be hard on the back\n:::*If the control is through the hips the upper body will have more mobility to operate the drums\n\n==Concept Development==\n\n===Wheel Design===\n\n:'''Problems from 2012:'''\n::*Needed power assistance to roll omni-wheels\n::*Basketball lost air occassionally\n::*Plastic balls on back did not roll well on turf\n::*Metal casters became dirty and would not spin properly depending on orientation\n:'''Improvements for 2013:'''\n::*Find a lower friction alternative setup for omni-wheels and casters\n::*Allow for high loads on each wheel\n::*Each wheel must roll smoothly on various surfaces, especially turf\n::*Basketball testing to prove\/disprove it as a viable option\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n!

The organization has begun building the first generation solar powered water filtration system in which a small 12 volt pump (powered by 60 watt solar panel) pulls water from a holding container and pushes the water through a basic carbon filter and into a storage tank for cooking and drinking.\nOur job as a team is to improve the current system to meet the World Heath Organizations criteria for clean drinking water. [http:\/\/www.who.int\/water_sanitation_health\/dwq\/en\/ Water Sanitation Health W.H.O.]\n\n== Sponsor ==\n<blockquote>\nOrphans to Ambassadors is a nonprofit working with orphans and sustainable technology to create cleaner futures.  Not only do the technology, education, and practices give children cleaner water and food, brighter and safer energy, and more free time to be kids, we\u2019re also creating renewable foundations in developing countries where any growth means more technology: the cleaner now the better tomorrow.\n<\/blockquote>\n[http:\/\/www.who.int\/water_sanitation_health\/dwq\/en\/ Orphans to Ambassadors]\n\n== Problem Statement ==\n\nCurrently, orphanages are using a wide range of contaminated water to provide their kids for drinking, cooking, and bathing purposes. In most cases, the water is from a nearby exposed water source, and on occasion, the water is from a stagnant water source. A number of orphanages have their own wells, but the proximity of their latrines has in some cases contaminated the water source.\n\n== Design Goals ==\n[[File:Example.jpg|thumb|Design Tree Placeholder]]\n* Provide long-term sustainable solution for orphanages to clean drinking water in the most self-sufficient manner possible. Implement a robust enough system that parts can be replaced in the field, and don\u2019t require shipping components overseas.\n* Teach children the basic fundamental concepts of solar power and sustainable technologies.\n* Reduce children\u2019s exposure to water borne illnesses, primarily diarrhea and other water borne bacteria.\n* Reduce the cooking fuel (wood) needed to purify water by boiling water over an open fire.\n\n\n\n== Current Design Specifications == \n* The system produces 100 gallons\/day of potable water.\n* The water pressure minimum is 20 psi and the maximum  is 65 psi.\n* The potable water meets the following WHO regulations:\n** Cryptosporidium: 1.3 x 10-5 organisms per liter\n** Total Coliform: not detectable in 100 ml sample\n** E.Coli O157: not detectable in 100 ml sample\n** Giardia: <10 organisms per liter\n** Turbidity: <5 NTU\n* The transportable components of the system are contained within a  22\u201dlong x 18\u201d wide x 10\u201d deep casing.\n* The transportable components and casing weigh no more than 50 lbs.\n* The system has a digital display.\n* The system is completely solar powered.\n* The inlet connection is a \u00be\u201d female swivel.\n* The outlet connection is a  \u00be\u201d male threaded.\n* An instruction manual is provided with the system.\n* A tool\/repair kit is provided with the system.\n* Replacement parts are provided with the system.\n\n== Our Team ==\n[[File:Example.jpg|thumb|Team Pic Placeholder]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

video detection systems currently in use in traffic signal system operations\nprovide continuous traffic detection and monitoring needed for several advanced traffic control\napplications. Continuous monitoring of vehicle\u2019s speed, location, and acceleration in the trapezoidal field of view (FOV) of the camera is done at the image sensor level intelligently without requiring complicated digital post processing of video streams and the high communication bandwidth associated with it. The proposed trapezoid image sensor IC will also reduce the overall cost and complexity of the system while providing intelligent and continuous incoming traffic information. These will open doors for several dynamic traffic signal control applications reducing vehicle emissions and fuel consumption due to unnecessary stopping.\n\n==Problem Statement==\nModern traffic places much higher demands on monitoring and control devices than in the past. An intelligent image sensor and corresponding control system that is designed specifically for extracting \u201conly\u201d the dynamic properties of incoming traffic and the vehicles with high resolution, high speed, and embedded intelligence on sensor level is needed.\n\n==Problem

The accumulation of waste is a problem because it can lead to disease and cause other fish health related problems. The goal for out project is to succesfully create an automatic cleaning system for the raceways that would significantly decrease the human component of cleaning, as well as increase the quality of the process. \n==Sponsor== \n:Clear Springs Inc. of Idaho is the sponsor of this project. Clear Springs Inc. raises primarily Rainbow trout for food products. The have several hatchery farm locations throughout Idaho, but we are focusing specifically on their Box Canyon Farm location near Twin Falls Idaho. This hatchery has 180 fish rearing ponds. \n[[File:Box Canyon Farms.jpg|thumb|Left|400px|Box Canyon Farms ]]\n::[http:\/\/www.clearsprings.com Clear Springs Inc.]\n==Team Members== \n*Jeremy Schroeder\n*Levi Dawes \n*Matt Francis \n*Kate Wicher \n*Tao Xing, Advisor\n*Jeremy Cuddihy, Mentor \n==Design Goals== \n#Design an automated cleaning system with little maintenance.\n#Reduces fine particulate in raceways from accumulating downstream to increase fish health. \n#Maintains Current Phosphorous levels and Healthy Dissolved Oxygen levels.    \n#Analyses of flow using computational and experimental fluid dynamics. \n==Design Specifications== \n:Our design must accomplish the following\n*Fit within the existing specifications of the raceways (only minor raceway modifications) \n*Be more effective than the current system. \n*Reduce downstream flow of particulates \n*Stay within EPA regulations of flow and waste \n==Project Learning== \n===Background Research=== \n====Current Methods==== \n*A push screen that re-suspends particulate from the bottom and sides of the raceway\n[[File:Current Method 1.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Push Screen Method ]]\n*A vacuum that cleans waste once it has reached the quiescent zone \n[[File:Current method 2.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Vacuum System ]]\n====Baffle Methods====\n*Increases the flow at the bottom of the raceway to move waste\n*Has been implemented before but due to problems it is not currently in place\n====Brine Methods==== \n*Injects a solution with a density higher than water and the particulate to float the waste along the bottom to the quiescent zone\n*Has been tested in a controlled environment but never in an actual fish raceway\n====Interviews====\n=====Scott Williams, Aquaculture Center=====\n*Scott has previously worked for Clear Springs Inc. and had a vast knowledge of their operations \n*Suggested the baffle idea be our main focus due to simplicity and amount of previously tested ideas with same basic design\n=====Ken Cain, Fisheries Immunologist===== \n*Ken has also previously worked for Clear Springs Inc. \n*Suggested we move away from baffle idea because it has been tried many times and has never been successfully implemented \n*Confirmed that the introduction of a brine solution will not harm fish, but will actually help to kill bacteria in fish gills and scales. We will however have to test the brine method with fish in order to determine the effect fish movement has on brine solution at the bottom of the raceway.\n\n===== Jim Liou, Hydraulic Engineer===== \n*Provided brine solution research and method\n*Has previously used the brine solution method in a controlled environment (without fish)to test how it works as a waste removal system\n==Concept Development==\n===Brine Method=== \n===Baffle Method=== \n===Slope Method=== \n===Moving Vacuum Method===","timestamp":"20131025193448","user-timestamp":"20131023201639","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Screen_Shot_2013-10-25_at_1.07.31_PM.png","comment":"Existing Bassoon Fingering Finder Application Screenshots","content":"Existing Bassoon Fingering Finder Application Screenshots","timestamp":"20131025200950","user-timestamp":"20131015200743","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Screen_Shot_2013-10-25_at_1.07.11_PM.png","comment":"Existing Bassoon Fingering Finder Application Screenshots","content":"Existing Bassoon Fingering Finder Application Screenshots","timestamp":"20131025200950","user-timestamp":"20131015200743","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Screen_Shot_2013-10-25_at_1.07.55_PM.png","comment":"Existing Bassoon Fingering Finder Application Screenshots","content":"Existing Bassoon Fingering Finder Application Screenshots","timestamp":"20131025200951","user-timestamp":"20131015200743","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"2","title":"Mill5624","comment":"Created page with \"Mitch Miller mill5624@vandals.uidaho.edu\"","content":"Mitch Miller\nmill5624@vandals.uidaho.edu","timestamp":"20131025201103","user-timestamp":"20131025200227","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"StatementofWork.pdf","comment":"This is an unsigned copy of team Two Buffoons and a Bassoon's statement of work detailing the expectations for the continued development of the Bassoon Fingering Finder web application for Senior design, Fall 2013.

Hybrid competitions. \n\nThe mission of the Vandal Hybrid Racing Team is to build the best Formula Hybrid vehicle possible using our acquired engineering and real world skills while having a good time. The Vandal Hybrid Racing Team is a great way for students to gain appreciation for the hands on side of engineering. Many skills used to build the formula hybrid vehicle are not taught in the class, but gained through trial and error along with plenty of practice. Because of the vast range of skills students learn while being a team member, the project produces very well rounded engineers with an appreciable understanding of how to apply engineering principles to every day challenges.\n\n[[File:Vandalhybrid2012.jpg|thumb|awesome]]","timestamp":"20131029190018","user-timestamp":"20131029184240","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"2014_VandalBucks_Buck_Knives_Logo.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20131029190714","user-timestamp":"20131025200227","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Niatt.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20131029191245","user-timestamp":"20131029184240","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Ui.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20131029191522","user-timestamp":"20131029184240","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Asui.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20131029191835","user-timestamp":"20131029184240","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Fast.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20131029191856","user-timestamp":"20131029184240","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Cart.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20131029192117","user-timestamp":"20131029184240","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Nmt.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20131029192135","user-timestamp":"20131029184240","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Jani.png","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20131029192207","user-timestamp":"20131029184240","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Au.png","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20131029192425","user-timestamp":"20131029184240","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"FETCH","comment":"Created

renewable energy sources. As many renewable resources can be seasonal, Team Green aims to discover methods of making those resources sustainable year-round.\nThe main focus of this project will be The Barn, a dining facility that can seat up to 200 people.

The track would be mounted using a pivot joint to account for the angle at which the user would be sitting. The parallel tracks would be attached to arms. The tracks would use a rack and pinion system for motion. The prosthetic liner would be folded over the arms and, as the tracks moved linearly toward the user, the liner would be donned on the leg.\n\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|'''Pros:'''\n::*High Torque Capabilities\n::*Precise and Reliable\n::*Deflection Eliminated in Donning Process\n::*Simple, Accurate Design\n\n'''Cons:'''\n::*Large, Bulky System\n::*Unstable Due to Elevated Mounting\n\n|-\n\n| [[File:linearactuator.png|thumb|center|200px|]] \n|valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"| '''Linear Actuating System'''\n\nSimilar to parallel track system, however, instead of using a rack and pinion system, linear actuators would be on each side of the user with arms mounted to them. The arms would have expanding capabilities to accommodate the change in circumference of the residual limb. Using non-simultaneous donning, the device would mimic the hand motion most often associated with donning; one hand pushes up at a time. Through limited testing, the non-simultaneous donning proved to require less force to don. \n\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|'''Pros:'''\n::*Simultaneous or Alternating Actuation\n::*Compact Design\n::*Position\/Feedback Control with Potentiometer Capabilities\n\n'''Cons:'''\n::*Multiple Actuator Timing\n::*Unstable Arms\n::*High Cost\n|-\n\n| [[File:GliderTrack.JPG|thumb|center|200px|Whole System]] [[File:Ramp.JPG|thumb|center|200px|Ramp that the glider track will rest on]]\n\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"| '''Glider Track System'''\n\nThis concept utilizes and exterior approach rather than the interior approaches discussed with the previous design alternatives. The glider donning system utilizes a carriage that glides along a single track. Attached to the carriage are two horizontal actuators which function to move the garter hands onto and off of the liner. The garter hands are spring loaded so that they can accommodate the width of the residual limb. The whole system is attached to a ramp that can adjust to different heights according to the user's chair height. \n\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|'''Pros:'''\n::*Single Track System\n::*Horizontal or Elevated\n::*Force\/Speed\n::*Ground Support\n::*Adjustable\n::*Accommodates Dynamic Loading\n::*Comfortable for User\n\n'''Cons:'''\n::*Possible Arm Deflection\n\n|}\n\n===Garter Design Alternatives===\nA garter is what we have named the device that will be mounted on the end of the device's arms and will be the part of the device that comes in direct contact with the patient's liner.

The pre-existing rain catchment system is the primary water source and potentially contains pathogens and sediments that could be harmful to human health. Currently, the orphanages do not have filtration or disinfection devices to protect against these contaminants. \n\n[[File:logoH2Orpahns.png|600px|thumb|right|H2Orpahns and Orphans to Ambassadors]]\n\n== Sponsor Background ==\nOrphans to Ambassadors is working with multiple orphanages in developing countries to build a long term solution to address the lack of clean drinking water available at children\u2019s homes and orphanages. The organization has begun building the first generation solar powered water filtration system in which a small 12 volt pump (powered by 60 watt solar panel) pulls water from a holding container and pushes the water through a basic carbon filter and into a storage tank for cooking and drinking.\nOur job as a team is to improve the current system to meet the World Heath Organizations criteria for clean drinking water.

Not only do the technology, education, and practices give children cleaner water and food, brighter and safer energy, and more free time to be kids, we\u2019re also creating renewable foundations in developing countries where any growth means more technology: the cleaner now the better tomorrow.\n<\/blockquote>\n[http:\/\/www.who.int\/water_sanitation_health\/dwq\/en\/ Orphans to Ambassadors]\n\n== Our Team ==\n<!--[[File:TeamPic.jpg|300px|thumb|right|TeamPic]]-->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The motors will be new in that she is using linear induction motors as the wheel as well as the drive system which will be much more efficient. However because the only rotation part of the motor is the rim, it makes braking and connecting the motor to the car difficult.<br>\nThe electrical engineers on our team are working on a regenerative braking system as well as a battery charging system for the vehicle.\nBoth from a mechanical and electrical standpoint we must be able to design an build a testing apparatus for the motors.\n\n===Linear Induction Motor:===\n[[File:LinearInductionMotor.png|thumb|right|Linear Induction Motor Dimensions]]\n* Rotating rim called the rotor\n* Static center called the stator made of laminated metal plates with fins and wire coils wrapped around the fins\n* Projected speed (straight line) - 35mph\n* Projected power - 25lb\n* The rim is projected to fit a 14in tire size\n\n====How it works:====\nThis motor is not much different than a simple Induction motor. There are multiple coils around the stator that take alternating currents that make a magnetic field that 'pulls' the rotor around the stator<br>\n\n==Design Objectives:==\n* Mechanical Braking\n** The vehicle must be able to stop the vehicle in a reasonable amount of time\n** The brakes should not add too much weight to the wheel\n* Regenerative Charging\n** The motors should be able to act as generators to save energy as the vehicle is braked electrically \n* Wheel Attachments\n** The wheel attachments should be able to take the force of the motors as well as the weight of the vehicle\n** The wheel attachments should be easy to attach to a test apparatus as well as the suspension of the vehicle\n** The rim of the wheel should be removable to accommodate for wet or dry tires at competition\n==Design Ideas==\n\n\n# Mechanical Braking [[File:Rpdchrge.png|thumb|right|Rapid charging Circuit]]\n## Perimeter disc brakes\n## 'Outside' brake disc\n## Inverted brake caliper\n# Rapid Charging [[File:Regen control flow.png|thumb|right|Regenerator Control Flow Chart]]\n#* Three types of charges used\n#** Type1 - 120V AC (regular wall socket)\n#** Type2 - 220V AC (washer\/dryer socket)\n#** Type3 - 480V DC \n# Regenerative Breaking\n#* Recover the kinetic energy lost during breaking\n#* Recharge the batteries with the energy recovered\n#* Ultra-Capacitor bank\n#** Store the recovered energy before supplying to the batteries(if necessary)\n# Wheel Center\n#* Attach directly to the stator\n#* Make it so an upright can attach to the center of the wheel center\n#* Make a mounting point for the brake caliper\n\n==Design Models==\n* Wheel Center attachment [[File:Wheel center attachment.png|thumb|right|Wheel center attachment to the stator]]\n** The stator is the fixed part of the motor and hence the wheel center is attached to the stator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Inverted Brakes [[File:Brakes.png|thumb|right|Perimeter Brake concept]]\n** The disc (perimeter) brakes are inverted and attached to the wheel. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Full Assembly [[File:Full assembly.png|thumb|right|Full assembly concept]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n==Other Information==\nThe Formula Electric Vehicle (EV) is a new project that is currently in the design phase.

The plan was to collaborate between their disciplines and create a finely tuned, expertly engineered drum set that is fit for a full on-field marching band performance.\n\nThe Fall of 2011 marked the initial experimentation and design of the Beest by a Capstone Design team in the engineering department. These initial tests provided insight on what worked well and what needed improvement. The final design from this year was never seen outside of the engineering buildings on campus, but the following year's goals were clear and a new design began immediately. For more in depth design details refer to the [http:\/\/seniordesign.engr.uidaho.edu\/2011-2012\/drumroll\/main.html '''Team Drum Roll'''] webpage.\n\nThe Fall of 2012 marked the first public introduction of the Beest, which has become a yearly project in the Capstone Design process. Dan Mathewson, a University of Idaho graduate student, designed and utilized a robotic, power driven front wheel that responded to the drummers input and included brightly lit led's on the forward facing drums. It successfully astounded the audience and fulfilled the requirement of marching with a wheeled drum set, but it could still be improved. Dan's thesis can be found in the [[Band-Beesten rolling drum set#References|'''References''']] section.\n\nThe goal of the 2013 Band-Beesten Experience team is to recreate the Beest to operate fully under the drummer control without the robotic assistance while making it bigger and better than before.\n\n[[#toc|''Return to contents'']]\n\n==Design Specifications==\n:'''Carry at minimum:'''\n::*One 14\u201d diameter, 8\u201d deep, 8lb Timbale\n::*One 15\u201d diameter, 8\u201d deep, 9lb Timbale\n::*One 14\u201d diameter, 4\u201d deep, 13lb snare\n::*One 18\u201d diameter, 4lb cymbal\n::*One 19\u201d diameter, 7lb roto-tom\n:'''General features:'''\n::*Move in all directions on a single plane (forward, backward, side to side, and radially)\n::*Move freely in those directions at marching speeds up to 2 m\/s\n::*Adjust to a wide range of user heights \n::*Lightweight, ~100lbs\n::*Free-standing\n::*Human powered (No motored assistance)\n\n[[#toc|''Return to contents'']]\n\n==Project Learning==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\"|\n!  style=\"text-align: left;\"|Interviewee\n!  style=\"text-align: left;\"|Overview\n\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|'''Dan Mathewson'''\nGraduate student who worked on 2012 Band Beesten model\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|\n\n'''Frame and Omni-Wheel Tips'''\n:*Single omni-wheels were used because he wanted a constant contact surface on the ball for the drive system, which also reduced the cost.\n:*Suggested exploring other omni-wheel configurations and testing to see which is more efficient\/easy to maneuver.

test the friction coefficients of casters and omni-wheels.\n\nThe apparatus allows for the use of both casters and omni-wheels, and their position can be adjusted to find the optimal settings.\n\nThe omni-wheels can be rotated in 90<sup>o<\/sup> increments to test for the most effective orientation.\n\nAn electronic fish scale will be used to measure the amount of force needed to pull the apparatus across a table.\n\nThe test is explained in more detail in the [[Band-Beesten rolling drum set#Testing| '''Omni-Wheel\/Ball Caster Friction Testing''']] section below.\n\n|valign=\"top\"

tests.\n\nIt requires three, vertically oriented, double omni-wheels spaced evenly along the upper portion of the ball as well as three single omni-wheels along the under section to provide support.\n\nThe angle of the top tier of omni-wheels is measured at 50<sup>o<\/sup> from the equator of the basketball, while the lower supporting wheels are on the equator.\n\nThe lower omni-wheels are spaced 1\/4 inch from the ball and are only in place as support to prevent the ball from escaping. \n\nAll of the arms are identical, interchangeable, and easy to manufacture in large groups.\n\nThe inner hub contains a bearing that will allow the wheel to rotate toward the most natural orientation.\n\n\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|'''Pros:'''\n::*Lightweight, minimizes

fishing scale to the force of the pull.\n\n'''Set-up:'''\n\nA fish scale is being used to measure the force required to move the wheel testing apparatus.\n\nIn conjunction with the scale, there is a DATAQ-155 data acquisition device that can be connected to a computer to record the voltage changes of the pulling force.\n\nIn order to use this and accurately measure the force for each pull it needs to be calibrated and an equation formulated for the final test.\n\nA more detailed explanation can be found in the final report:\n\n[[:File:Fish Scale Correlation Testing.pdf|'''Fishing Scale Report''']]\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|The data was compiled in Excel and the final correlations were calculated.\n\nThey can be found in the link below:\n\n[[:File:Fish Scale Final

Testing'''\n\n'''Objective:'''\n\nWe needed to find the optimum wheel type, orientation, and angle placement to produce a ball wheel with the lowest friction possible.\n\n'''Set-up:'''\n\nThe apparatus is pulled with the fishing scale to measure the force needed to  move the wheel from a resting position.\n\nThree types of wheels are being tested, single omni-wheels, paired omni-wheels, and ball casters.\n\nThe types will be tested using angles ranging from 40<sup>o<\/sup> up to 55<sup>o<\/sup>, and the omni-wheels will be oriented either vertically or horizontally.\n\nOnce the forces are recorded and the apparatus is weighed, the friction can be calculated for each variation.\n\nFor the full test explanation, see the final report:\n\n[[:File:BandBeesten 2013 OmniBall Final Report.pdf|'''Friction Testing Report''']]\n\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|The test revealed that the friction reduces as the angle rises.\n\nThe best orientation for a final product is with the paired omni-wheels in the horizontal orientation at 50<sup>o<\/sup> from the equator of the basketball.\n\nThis orientation is deemed best as long as there are supporting wheels below the equator to prevent the ball from rolling off of the wheel base.\n\nSee more detailed results below:\n\n[[:File:BandBeesten 2013 OmniWheel Results.pdf|'''Friction Testing Results''']]\n\n|-\n|[[File:IMG

and work on improvements before creating the final design.\n\n'''Set-up:'''\n\nThis frame was a wood mock-up of version 3 seen in the [[Band-Beesten rolling drum set#Frame Design| '''Frame Design''']] section above with slight modification for visualization purposes.\n\nIt was built with wood donated and cut by the [http:\/\/www.uidaho.edu\/cnr '''College of Natural Resources'''], and was pieced together using various screws and brackets.\n\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|\n\nThe mock-up worked well and provided a chance to modify it quickly and reinforce where necessary.\n\nDue to time constraints, this frame became part of the final design.\n\nIt could use some further redesigning and testing to be more complete and easier to recreate but worked well for the purposes of this project.\n\n|-\n|}\n\n[[#toc|''Return to contents'']]\n\n==Document Archive==\n\n[[:File:Fish Scale Correlation Testing.pdf|'''Fishing Scale Report''']]\n\n[[:File:Fish Scale Final

The steam plants main purpose is to provide steam for heating and cooling inside the buildings on campus. As the load got higher, 3 more boilers were installed on site to help maintain the constant pressure and flow needed for the campus. The primary boiler used today is the wood boiler. It was installed in 1985 and can run a flow rate of up to 60,000 lb\/hr. The highest school load recorded was ~70,000 lb\/hr, therefore the other 3 boilers are natural gas fueled and are used at load amounts that exceed the capacity of the wood boiler.\n\n=Feasibility Analysis Specifications=\n*Electrical load profiling\n*Thermal load profiling\n*New utility rate structure analysis\n*Unit sizing\n*Thermal use determination\/distribution system analysis\n*Installation cost estimates \n*Permitting impacts\n*Utility interconnection requirements\n*Financial calculations(simple payback, IRR, Cash Flow Diagrams)\n*Presentation of six design\/construction models to client\n*Fully develop client design preference\n\n\n=Current System Model=\n[[File:UI_Steamplant_(Current_System)(with_pictures).jpg|thumb|right|280px|UI Steam Plant Current System]]\nThe Current System Model is broken up into 7 stages.\n*Boilers\n*Pressure Reducing Valves\n*Condenser(Campus)\n*Condensate Tank\n*Condensate Pumps\n*Dearator Tank\n*Feedwater Pumps\n{|width=\"100%\"\n|    \n|}\n== Model Options ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!width=\"150px\"|Turbine Model\n!Description\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| Simple Turbine Model\n|style=\"padding:5px\"|This Turbine option will consist of 1 turbine that runs alongside the current PRV's.

EES is further utilized in estimating the isentropic efficiency of several existing turbines at other universities. Finally, it will be used to predict predict power generation of both turbine system models. \n{|width=\"100%\"\n|    \n|}\n\n=Selected Models=\nBelow are the 2 models our client has chosen for us to model and continue looking into for the spring semester of 2014.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\"|\n!  style=\"text-align: left;\"|Model Diagram\n!  style=\"text-align: left;\"|Specifications\n!  style=\"text-align: left;\"|Methodolgy\n\n|-\n\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"center\"|[[File:Simple_Turbine_Model.jpg|frameless|center|350px|]]\n\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|'''Simple Turbine Model'''\n\n\nThe simple turbine model is bypassing the existing PRV's with a turbine. Inlet pressures would remain around 130 psi with a campus distribution pressure at 60 psi. For the spring semester, we will be conducting an economic analysis as well as implementation costs for this basic turbine package.\n\n\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|[[File:Methodology2.png|frameless|center|300px|]]\n\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"center\"|[[File:Plummer_Model_(Superheat).jpg|frameless|center|350px|]]\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|'''Plummer Superheated Model'''\n\nThe Plummer Superheated model will be analyzed to see if it is a viable option for the University of Idaho. The Plummer Model is a condensing turbine that will require a condenser and cooling tower. It's pros are that it can generate a large amount of power but this comes at a higher need for fuel. Also, the steam in this system will require superheating to get max efficiency from our turbine. Superheating steam will require much more safety and preventative maintenance for the plant as well.\n\n\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|[[File:Methodology1.png|frameless|center|300px|]]\n\n\n|}\n=Team Members=\n\n\n{| width=\"800\" border=\"2\"\n|-\n!

As well as electrical engineering, I am also finishing a degree in philosophy. The decision to pursue an engineering degree developed out of a dissatisfaction with my then career prospects as a telecommunication contractor and a desire to obtain a theoretical background for electrical engineering.  For the last two years I have greatly enjoyed the opportunity to work with the University of Idaho Industrial Assessment Center.  Working with the UIIAC on energy efficiency audits as well as taking the Lean Manufacturing Course through the Mechanical Engineering Department has provided me with the opportunity to see concepts learned in the class room actually being applied in industry.  Upon graduation, I hope to apply my previous experiences as a residential framing business owner and telecommunications contractor with my newly found skills in electrical engineering and energy efficiency towards a career within both the power engineering \/construction fields.\n\nExpected Graduation: August 2015\n\n|}\n|| EE\n|- align=\"left\"\n| [[File:Photo Oct 03, 6 18 59 PM.jpg|150px|center]]||align=\"top\"|\n{| align=\"top\"\n| align=\"top\"|'''Chad Dunkel'''\n|-\n| My name is Chad Dunkel and I am interested in energy engineering, industrial processes, and industrial waste streams.

The transmitter projects an array of parallel infrared light beams to the receiver which consists of a number of photoelectric cells. When an object breaks one or more of the beams a stop signal is sent to the guarded equipment.\n\n\n|}\n\n===Enclosure===\n\n====Current Design====\n\n'''3 Piece Design'''\n\n{|\n| [[File:single3piecerender_1.jpg|350x200px|thumb|Full Model]]\n\n\n| [[File:single3piecedisconnectedrender_1.jpg|350x200px|thumb|Disconnected]]\n\n|}\n\n{|\n\n| [[File:3piecebracerender_1.jpg|350x200px|thumb|Brace]]\n\n| [[File:double3piecerender_1.jpg|350x200px|thumb|With two robots]]\n\n|}\n\n<br style=\"clear:both\" \/>\n\nThe three piece design has one main piece and two side pieces. The main piece is larger and holds the robot as well as the electronic equipment below the robot platform. The two side pieces hang on opposite sides of the central piece. The sides are attached as shown with the bolt holding it.As with other designs the doors are wire mesh with polycarbonate sides for viewing.The design is simple and uses fewer parts. Fewer parts make disassembling and regular maintenance easy.\n\n====Previous Designs====\n\n'''Two Piece Design'''\n{|\n| [[File:proto1.jpg|x200px|thumb|Full Model]]\n\n| [[File:proto2.jpg|x200px|thumb|One Side]]\n\n| [[File:proto3.jpg|x200px|thumb|With Lower Doors]]\n\n|}\n\n<br style=\"clear:both\" \/>\nOur first conceptual design was the two piece design.The two piece design uses two identical sides to make up the enclosure. Separation of the enclosure is needed to fit on the service elevator for transport. The partitions are depicted above. The robot is affixed to both sides in the center.The front and back use polycarbonate sheets and a wire mesh is used for the doors. The lower portion of the design will store the controller and safety equipment on one side. The other side can store objects for demonstration such as an armature. Caster wheels are used on the bottom.\n\n'''Collapsible Design'''\n{|\n| [[File:singleaccordionopenrender_1.jpg|350x200px|thumb|Full Model Open]]\n\n| [[File:singleaccordionclosingrender_1.jpg|350x200px|thumb|Closing]]\n\n| [[File:accordioninmotion.gif|200px|thumb|How hinge works]]\n\n|}\n{|\n| [[File:singleaccordionclosedrender_1.jpg|350x200px|thumb|Closed]]\n\n| [[File:doubleaccordionrender_1.jpg|350x200px|thumb|With two robots]]\n\n|}\n\n<br style=\"clear:both\" \/>\n\nThe collapsible design is made of one central piece with two attached sides. The design is similar to the 3 piece, but instead of having sides that can be removed, the sides collapse to minimize space. The sides also have supports that reach the ground instead of hanging, but still remove the shelving on the lower portion.\n<br style=\"clear:both\" \/>\n\n====Options====\n\n'''Safety light curtain'''\n\nWe have decided that the light curtain was not cost effective for the project but it may be beneficial for other projects.The safety light curtain can be used to have a completely open viewing area on one side of the enclosure. A problem is if the robot is manipulating an object the curtain can't stop the object if it is thrown past. To fix this, we can use a detachable polycarbonate sheet when objects are being used otherwise leave it off. \n\n'''Separation of enclosure'''\n\nThe enclosure needs to separate or at least minimize because the full expanded enclosure can't fit in the service elevator.  \n\n'''Top of enclosure'''\n\nThe top of the enclosure will likely be a simple mesh covering. The top shouldn't interfere with visibility, but a top is needed to keep objects out.\n\n'''Base'''\n\nWe have decided to use legs instead of wheels however there are some tradeoffs. The base design can use wheels or just legs on the ground. With wheels, the enclosure can be pushed around anywhere. Another option is just have it lifted by a jack and transported. Getting rid of the wheels would improve stability but might hurt mobility since some parts would need to be carried until we got them to a jack.\n\n'''Multiple safety redundancies'''\n\nWe do want multiple fail-safes but we don't want to design to the extreme so even a child could operate it. We could use safety procedures to supplement a lack of automatic safety checking. For example, instead of having magnetic switches on the sides we can just have the operator perform safety checks on the sides.\n\n===Safety Measures===\n\n==External

The accumulation of waste is a problem because it can lead to disease and cause other fish health related problems. Fish waste and food particles can accumulate at the bottom of raceways and are easily re-suspended in water by turbulent flow or fish movement. The current method of cleaning fish raceways is a very tedious and slow task that does not clean the raceway 100%. The goal for our project is to successfully create an automatic cleaning system for the raceways that would significantly decrease the human component of cleaning, as well as increase the efficiency of the process and quality of the cleaning.\n\n==Design Goals== \n#Design an automated cleaning system with little maintenance.\n#Reduces fine particulate in raceways from accumulating downstream to increase fish health. \n#Maintains Current Phosphorous levels and Healthy Dissolved Oxygen levels.    \n#Analyses of flow using computational and experimental fluid dynamics. \n==Design Specifications== \n:Our design must accomplish the following\n*Fit within the existing specifications of the raceways (only minor raceway modifications) \n*Be more effective than the current system. \n*Reduce downstream flow of particulates \n**While continuing to produce 5 to 7 cfs of flow in the raceway\n*Stay within EPA regulations of flow and waste\n**Current EPA standards are being researched to provide exact numbers on downstream waste\n\n==Project Learning== \n===Background Research=== \n'''Current Methods''' \n*A push screen that re-suspends particulate from the bottom and sides of the raceway\n[[File:Current Method 1.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Push Screen Method ]]\n*A vacuum that cleans waste once it has reached the quiescent zone \n[[File:Current method 2.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Vacuum System ]]\n'''Baffle Methods'''\n*Increases the flow at the bottom of the raceway to move waste\n*Has been implemented before but due to problems it is not currently in place\n'''Brine Methods''' \n*Injects a solution with a density higher than water and the particulate to float the waste along the bottom to the quiescent zone\n*Has been tested in a controlled environment but never in an actual fish raceway\n===Interviews===\n\n'''Scott Williams, Aquaculture Center'''\n*Scott has previously worked for Clear Springs Inc. and had a vast knowledge of their operations \n*Suggested the baffle idea be our main focus due to simplicity and amount of previously tested ideas with same basic design\n'''Ken Cain, Fisheries Immunologist''' \n*Ken has also previously worked for Clear Springs Inc. \n*Suggested we move away from baffle idea because it has been tried many times and has never been successfully implemented \n*Confirmed that the introduction of a brine solution will not harm fish, but will actually help to kill bacteria in fish gills and scales. We will however have to test the brine method with fish in order to determine the effect fish movement has on brine solution at the bottom of the raceway.\n\n''' Jim Liou, Hydraulic Engineer''' \n*Provided brine solution research and method\n*Has previously used the brine solution method in a controlled environment (without fish)to test how it works as a waste removal system\n\n==Visit to Clear Springs== \n:On November 23rd our design team visited the Clear Springs facility in Buhl, ID. They gave us a tour while we asked questions and discussed design parameters and options. They're facility is primarily a food stock farm (producing fish primarily for food purposes) but it also has a few brude stock (spawning) operations.\n*Important design restraints gathered from the trip: \n**The flow in each raceway is roughly 7 cfs, it cannot drop to below than 5 cfs or fish in the downstream raceways will start to die \n**Current QZ zones are cleaned 1\/3 at a time and the water from the cleaning goes into an 8 in. pipe and is transported to a settling lagoon from there \n**The furthest upstream raceway is the most sensitive to flow change because it has the youngest fish \n**Automated cleaning design would be most effective if it were portable from raceway to raceway, rather than a model being built for each individual raceway \n**Cost is the number 1 deciding factor \n\n*They seemed most interested in our baffle idea because: \n**Ease of use \n**Low cost \n**No modifications to the raceway required \n**Possibility for adjustments and easy maintenance \n*Their thoughts on the movable pump design:\n** More effective at cleaning than the baffle \n**Would require installation of equipment inside of the raceway \n**Outflow would have to be carefully monitored to maintain adequate flow in the raceway \n**Could tie into the 8 inch drainage pipe already in place \n**Potentially more costly but could clean more effectively and require less man hours than baffle\n\n==Concept Development==\n===Baffle Method===\n*Have tested a simple baffle design in our small flume \n*Exploring several new designs \n**Multiple baffles \n**Baffle with diffuser \n**Movable baffle \n*This option is our first priority because of its ease of use, cost effectiveness and overall portability \n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Baffle Systems\n!

Don't hire the incorrect lawyer. The lawyer you hire is really a tremendous difference. Use good sense in the selection process. Be observant, seek advice, and do not hire an attorney should you not be ok with your interaction with him or her. Here are some circumstances to consider in the initial choosing a lawyer: 1) does the lawyer have a very direct dial phone number? You can believe that when you have to move through a secretary or paralegal to achieve your lawyer, you will have a very harder time reaching him or her; 2) look for a cluttered office; in the event the lawyer is disorganized you are able to assume your case is going to be disorganized. If you see other clients' documents sitting in public view, you'll be able to are aware that your documents will soon be sitting outside in public the same way; 3) guarantee the lawyer features a written client agreement that ensures that you recognize your fees, rights and obligations; 4) don't hire the dabbler - someone who does a traffic ticket case in the morning, an actual estate closing inside afternoon and squeezes your case in somewhere inside middle; divorce is complicated enough that you need to bring in help would you it all day long, daily; and, 5) don't hire an attorney taking on more cases than s\/he are prepared for; ask the lawyer what her or his average caseload is.

When they decide to improve upon their homes, they really go all out and knock down walls, add on rooms, and change the layout of their property. If you're thinking of making any type of improvement at all but don't have the know how required, read this article.<br><br>Venetian blinds can be vacuumed but at some point, they need to be washed. One way to wash them is to put them in the bathtub and use a brush and solvent to clean off the accumulation of dust. An easier way, may be to wash them while still hanging. Put a plastic drop cloth underneath to keep water off the floor.<br><br>When renovating your home, you should always stay close to the home's original character. If your street is lined with Victorian-era tudors and you choose to turn your home into a glass-fronted homage to modern architecture, it will stick out uncomfortably and annoy your neighbors. Also, the more you differ from the home's original structure, the higher the cost of the renovation and the less your chance of getting a return on investment.<br><br>Devote some time into weather-stripping your home. Even though your house might be insulated, there are probably small crevices around windows and doors through which air will leak. That means your house will lose cool air during the summer and warm air during the winter, leading to a higher energy bill when you run heating and cooling appliances. Weather-stripping your doors and windows will keep that from happening.<br><br>If your bed doesn't come with a headboard, or you didn't purchase it with one, you can easily solve your problem. Use an old weathered wooden gate or a lovely iron gate to make a one of a kind headboard. That's something you won't see anywhere else and will not be sold in stores.<br><br>You should always wear safety glasses or goggles when cutting with a saw or other powered equipment. If you do not wear protective equipment for your eyes pieces of the material you are cutting or dust can become lodged in your eye or cause irritation. In severe cases permanent damage can be done to your eye.<br><br>Sealant strips and draft excluders can keep air from seeping out door cracks. A draft excluder is placed under the door and will prevent hot air from escaping out while preventing cold air from coming in. Sealant strips can be used for this as well. You can easily find these things in most hardware stores.<br><br>This article contains information about how a homeowner can better prepare to start home improving. While there are risks associated with many home improvement projects, careful planning and research can steer a homeowner past them, safely. It is not difficult to plan and execute a straightforward project that will make a home more livable and increase its value.<br><br>In case you liked this article and you would want to receive more

This article is to serve as a place where you can gain a lot of tips and insight onto how to travel better in the future.<br><br>If you plan on traveling, remember to schedule reliable pet care in advance. If you have a small dog, you can find pet-friendly flights and hotels and bring him along. Large dogs, cats, and animals with medical problems should have a reliable pet-sitter that you can trust. Your furry friends will be grateful!<br><br>If you will be driving to your destination, fill a family member or friend in on your destination and planned route to get there. If something were to happen to you while driving, this person would be able to alert officials of your intended destination and the roads you would have been traveling on.<br><br>If you are traveling with too much luggage to carry on an airplane, take a digital photograph of your bag and the baggage tag. These come in handy if your bag is lost. The photos give you something to reference when describing your bag to the airport personnel and the tag confirms that your bag was labeled for the right airport.<br><br>Have a door stopper to use during your hotel stay. Sometimes, you may need a tad more security at night when in your room. For example, the door to your hotel room may not have secure locks. In this case, you should have a rubber doorstop on hand to shove under the door.<br><br>When flying, never assume that the airline will tend to your every need, even on lengthy flights. Be sure to bring a blanket, headphones or pillow if you think you'll need them. Additionally, it is a good idea to bring something to snack on.<br><br>One of the easiest, most effective and affordable ways to offset the unflattering aftermath of jet lag, is to drink plenty of water. Being dehydrated can cause you to feel light-headed, dizzy and fatigued, upon landing. Seasoned travelers report that drinking at least four eight-ounce glasses of water over a five-hour trip, can make a noticeable difference.<br><br>When taking a cruise, your health should be your number one priority. Before you depart, speak with your doctor about the trip you are planning on taking and any extra medication you may need. Let your doctor know the ports your cruise ship will visit and all modes of transportation you may encounter. Your doctor can offer advice on where you can obtain medical care as well as where you can get a prescription filled in an emergency.<br><br>When packing for a baby or a toddler, think about what things you could possibly pick up when you get there. Diapers and wipes take up a lot of space, especially if you will be gone for a week or more. This will leave you more room, and you will need less time to pack.<br><br>All of these things are great in preparing yourself to go traveling to that exciting new country that you've always wanted to visit. Making sure you are prepared can take out all of the uncertainty that might make you nervous about being in a whole new place so you can simply enjoy your trip to the fullest.<br><br>In case you loved this article and you would love to receive more information concerning [http:\/\/www.islamargaritapaquetes.com\/ isla margarita all inclusive] please visit our site.","timestamp":"20140601201532","user-timestamp":"20140601200937","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Collet_Chuck_Total.png","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20140601202815","user-timestamp":"20140601201946","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Swapping_Lathe_Collet_Chuck","comment":"\/* How to Know What Chuck to Use *\/","content":"== How to Know What Chuck to Use ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\"| Types of Chucks:\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Tool\/Step!!style=\"text-align: left;\"|Description\n|- \n| {{RowPicture|fileName=Collet_Chuck_Total.png|caption=Collet Chuck|description=The collet chuck should be used for stock that is that is smaller and either cylinder shaped, hexagon cylinder shaped, or squared shaped.

The goal of their collaboration was to create a full drum set that could easily be played and moved easily by a single person during marching band performances. \n\nThe Fall of 2011 marked the beginning research of ideas for what they called the Beest. This acedemic year was solely an experimentation year; For more in depth design details refer to the [http:\/\/seniordesign.engr.uidaho.edu\/2011-2012\/drumroll\/main.html '''Team Drum Roll'''] webpage.\n\nThe design team of 2012-2013 made progress with the BandBeesten's design. Dan Mathewson, a UI graduate student, designed a robotic, power driven front wheel to enable the machine received commands through the operator's body movements. This design made it onto the field and more information on this can be found in Dan Mathewson's thesis. \n\nIn 2013, the design team started designing a new BandBeesten with a sturdier frame. This design relied only on man-power and did not have any assisting motors. The design used was very strong and could hold a full set of drums with ease. more information about this design can be found at \n\n[[#toc|''Return to contents'']]\n\n==Design Specifications==\n::*Move forward backward, and do 360 degree rotations.\n::*Have a forward speed of 2 mph\n::*Have a reverse speed of 2\/3 mph\n::*Complete a 360 degree rotation in under 2 seconds\n::*Lightweight\/ sturdy design\n::*Able to support ~150 lb\n::*Be able to stay charged during long performances \n\n[[#toc|''Return to contents'']]","timestamp":"20140703234837","user-timestamp":"20140602200821","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"KyleBio.jpeg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20140704004232","user-timestamp":"20140702191447","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"JoeBio.jpeg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20140704004605","user-timestamp":"20140702191447","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"JakeBio.jpeg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20140704005653","user-timestamp":"20140702191447","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Read_This_If_You_Are_Searching_For_Gold","comment":"Created page with \"\u04ache visible uptick \u0456n attenti\u0585n about rare metal buying and s\u0435lling is a thing probably attributable to the lat\u0435st economical instability as well as a \u01e5eneral need among...\"","content":"\u04ache visible uptick \u0456n attenti\u0585n about rare metal buying and s\u0435lling is a thing probably attributable to the lat\u0435st economical instability as well as a \u01e5eneral need amongst traders to \u01e5et reliable vehicles for individual money.

This team gives students the opportunity to demonstrate and further develop their engineering skills by challenging them to build a hybrid formula car. Because of the complexity of a hybrid vehicle, building it involves interdisciplinary collaboration between students. For the 2015 competition, the team will be using the same frame that was used in the 2014 competition. \n\n\n==Problem Statement==\nBecause the 2014 frame will be used in the 2015 competition, it is required that significant improvements must be made to the car. The team will strive to improve the car by redesigning problem components, reducing weight where possible, improving car handling, and increasing vehicle efficiency. This will produce a responsive, reliable, lightweight, high performance hybrid car.\n\n==Sub-System Problems and Improvements==\n\n===Brake Rotors===\n'''ISSUES:''' Front and rear brake rotors are larger than needed; only a fraction of the available friction surface is being used. Also, rear brake rotors are susceptible to cracking due to insufficient heat dissipation of the thin slotted design\n'''SOLUTION:'''\n*Redesign front and rear rotors, optimizing friction surface areas\n*Float both the front and rear rotors to reduce weight\n*Rear rotors will no longer be used for wheel speed sensor\nProgress: design done, material needs to be attained or designs need to be ordered.\n\n===Rear Wheel Toe===\n'''ISSUE:''' The toe in the rear wheels has slop in it due to flexing and component bending. This causes significant toe movement on the track.\n \n'''SOLUTION:'''\nOriginal solution was to shorten tie rods and add a holding bracket attached to the A-frame. Upon further investigation, we need to redesign\/repackage the upright assembly so a new solution will be implemented according to the new upright design.\n\n===Uprights===\n'''ISSUE:'''\n*upright assembly limits workable space for other assemblies\n\n'''SOLUTION:'''\n*Redesign upright assembly\n*optimize for minimal weight and suspension assembly compatibility\n\n===Brake Master Cylinders===\n'''ISSUE:''' \n*Brakes lock up after brakes get hot because built up pressure can not be properly alleviated from the high pressure line.

While the engine was off of the car, we noticed the crankshaft had a shaft endplay of 0.0475\". The stock engine case allows for \n0.016\" of endplay. To reduce the amount of endplay in our case, 0.020\" shims were placed under the main bearings. This reduced measured endplay to about 0.009\" and kept the connecting rod well centered in the cylinder. These shims should stop the crankshaft wearing behind the flywheel and should keep the connecting rod from developing excessive lateral endplay. \n\n'''SOLUTIONS:'''\n*fix crankshaft endplay with under-bearing shims\n*Run tests on the dyno engine and use that data to tune the race engine.\n*Maintain engine during driving\/testing days.\n\n===Steering Angle Sensor===\n'''ISSUE:'''\n*We currently have no way of logging steering angle data\n'''SOLUTION:'''\n*Design a sensor that can be used to log real time steering angle on the track\n\nProgress: Design made, needs to be prototyped and tested. \n\n===Wheel Speed Sensors===\n'''ISSUE:'''Current wheel speed sensor system requires brake rotors for timing.

The goal of their collaboration was to create a full drum set that could easily be played and moved easily by a single person during marching band performances. \n\nThe Fall of 2011 marked the beginning research of ideas for what they called the Beest. This acedemic year was solely an experimentation year; For more in depth design details refer to the [http:\/\/seniordesign.engr.uidaho.edu\/2011-2012\/drumroll\/main.html '''Team Drum Roll'''] webpage.\n\nThe design team of 2012-2013 made progress with the BandBeesten's design. Dan Mathewson, a UI graduate student, designed a robotic, power driven front wheel to enable the machine received commands through the operator's body movements. This design made it onto the field and more information on this can be found in Dan Mathewson's thesis. \n\nIn 2013, the design team started designing a new BandBeesten with a sturdier frame. This design relied only on man-power and did not have any assisting motors. The design used was very strong and could hold a full set of drums with ease. more information about this design can be found at \n\n[[#toc|''Return to contents'']]\n\n=='''Design'''==\n===Design Specifications===\n::*Move forward backward, and do 360 degree rotations.\n::*Have a forward speed of 2 mph\n::*Have a reverse speed of 2\/3 mph\n::*Complete a 360 degree rotation in under 2 seconds\n::*Lightweight\/ sturdy design\n::*Able to support ~150 lb\n::*Be able to stay charged during long performances \n\n[[#toc|''Return to contents'']]\n\n===Frame===\n\nThe first generation of the Bandbeesten was a great proof of concept using lightweight aluminum and incorporated few connecting beam, but the minimalistic approach did have flaws. The frame was weak and would flex whenever the user wanted to perform a maneuver.\n\nIn 2013, a solution was found by using a tetrahedron frame. This frame puts every beam within it in either tension or compression, minimizing bending and flexing. Although this frame was very strong, wood was used as a building material making it bulky.\n\nThe latest version of the Bandbeesten combines features of previous generations by using a minimalist aluminum design to minimize weight and a tetrahedron shape to maximize strength.\n\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\"|\n!  style=\"text-align: left;\"|\n!  style=\"text-align: left;\"|\n\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"center\"|[[File:Beesten frame design 2014.png|frameless|center|300px|]]\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|'''Frame Design'''\n\n*Strong tetrahedral shape\n*Aluminum tube construction\n*Lightweight construction\n*Use a simple design that would allow for folding when not in use\n*Drums mounted to one central location\n*Add electric motors to help with maneuvering\n\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"center\"|[[File:BeestenFrame_1.JPG|frameless|center|300px|]]\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|'''Frame Prototype'''\n\n*Strong tetrahedral shape\n*lightweight\n*Wood needs extra support due to weakness when applying pressure across grains\n*Using a weak material in the prototype allows easy observation of stress concentration points \n\n|}\n\n[[#toc|''Return to contents'']]\n\n===Wheels===\n\nThe BandBeesten must be able to be moved in any direction on a moment\u2019s notice to keep up with the marching band\u2019s routine.

There is a need for a charging system capable of charging approximately 200 packs safely and efficiently within a one week time frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n==Problem Definition==\n===Background===\n[[File:T800-3-20.jpg|thumb|left|Turnigy 800mAh 3S 20C Lipo Pack]]\n;The Lithium-Ion Battery\n:Minimum Capacity: 800mAh\n:Configuration: 3S1P\/11.1v\/3cell\n:Constant Discharge: 20C\n:Peak Discharge(10sec): 30C\n:Pack Weight: 75g\n:Pack Size: 57x29x23mm\n:Charge Plug: JST-XH<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nA device which can switch between multiple lithium polymer batteries after charge completion of a single battery and hence charges in a sequence is required by the University of Idaho marching band.Automatic switching of the batteries during the charging process requires less user interface and the circuitry to design the aforementioned device is one that can be achieved under a moderate budget. The prototype and the circuitry can be multiplied and extended as the number of batteries to be charged increases and further improvement of the circuit can also reduce costs.\n\n===Problem Statement===\nA robust lithium polymer battery charger that requires less user interface is desired for charging batteries used in the light show produced by the University of Idaho marching band. The prototype required should charge 10 batteries in a day and thus 50 batteries in a week. In future iterations of the project a system containing four of the prototypes modules can be connected in parallel to charge 40 batteries in a day and hence 200 batteries in a week .\n\n===Specifications===\nMarketing specifications:\n* 200 batteries need to be charged per week.\n* Should be user friendly and require minimum amount of interfacing during or after charging.\n* The device should be scalable so that the prototype could be multiplied or added to charge more batteries in future iterations i.e. a modular system.\n* The charging status should be indicated to the user.\n\nEngineering Specifications:\n* Since 200 batteries needs to be charged per business week, a battery matrix system (charging multiple batteries or charging in sequence through a single board) needs to be formulated. Charging circuit for parallel (simultaneously) or series (charging 1 battery then switching to the next in series) needs to be devised.\n* For minimum interfacing, a control system needs to be integrated within the design that controls the voltage and current flow to the batteries. Possible microcontroller programming required.\n* The rows and column number of the battery matrix will decide the number of batteries to be charged, parallel or serial charging and the amount of interfacing required. The number of batteries being charged per 2 hrs. (Approx. charging rate for a single battery) or over a course of a day or a week needs to be analyzed to allow the client minimum interfacing but good results. \n\nDesign Specifications:\n* A battery matrix of 10 X 1 was decided. The design will charge one battery at a time and switch to the next one in the column as          soon as the microcontroller senses a voltage change. Hence the design will charge 10 batteries in roughly 20 hours and 40 batteries in the same time if 4 modules of the design are used and connected in parallel to a power supply. Thus, it will charge 200 batteries\/business week. This matrix was selected since it will require minimum interfacing from the user as 40 batteries have to be connected once and removed by the end of the day rather than charging 10 batteries in parallel, that will require plugging the batteries in and out after every 2 hours. The single evaluation board circuit (single IC) will be used to charge and will switch to the next battery in the column through a switching circuit consisting of a Solid State Relay (TLP3100) and controlled by a microcontroller.\n* Arduino Uno was selected because of it\u2019s small size and a list of important functions (required for the project) that it could implement. \n* For charging 200 batteries per week, four of the PCB boards (10 X 1 matrix per board) connected in parallel to a power supply can be used. The whole modular system will charge 40 batteries per day hence 200 batteries per week. A single PCB board will be designed and made while the modular system is left for future senior design teams to finish.\n\n==Design==\n===Selections===\n[[File:Photo (2).JPG|thumb|right|ti bq241xx (bqSWITCHER) Evaluation Module]]\n====Evaluation Charging Circuit====\nThe ti bq241xx (bqSWITCHER) evaluation module delivers a suitable technique for evaluating a charging management solution for portable applications. The evaluation module used incorporates the ti bq24115 IC which fulfills the capacity of charging more than three battery cells in series safely and efficiently. The evaluation module for the bq24115 chip is default set to charge one battery cell, but by using the voltage output regulation formula, provided by the integrated circuit's datasheet, one can find the modifiable resistance across two nodes on the module and is able to configure up to three battery cells in series (~12v). By evaluating and observing the module, the constant current and constant voltage characteristics become apparent when testing. First the voltage begins to rise and current is constant. Once the voltage reaches maximum voltage the current decreases to prevent the battery from creating too much pressure inside possibly initiating a fire. Current drops to zero and voltage falls slightly due to charge termination. An occasional topping charge can be applied to top off the charge.\n====Microcontroller====\nThe Arduino Uno Revison 3 microcontroller board was selected according to desired criteria such as the suitable size, suitable memory, sufficient analog & digital input\/output, and large product support. The Arduino Uno R3 is a simple yet robust microcontroller that is based off the Atmega328 processor.\n\nSummary\n\nMicrocontroller                        ATmega328<br>\nOperating Voltage                    5V<br>\nInput Voltage (recommended)\t7-12V<br>\nInput Voltage (limits)         \t6-20V<br>\nDigital I\/O Pins\t                        14 (of which 6 provide PWM output)<br>\nAnalog Input Pins\t                6<br>\nDC Current per I\/O Pin\t        40 mA<br>\nDC Current for 3.3V Pin\t        50 mA<br>\nFlash Memory\t                        32 KB (ATmega328) of which 0.5 KB used by bootloader<br>\nSRAM\t                                2 KB (ATmega328)<br>\nEEPROM\t                                1 KB (ATmega328)<br>\nClock Speed\t                        16 MHz<br>\n\n====Relay====\n\n===Detailed Design===\n====Design Schematic====\n[[File:PCB_Schematic.PNG|1000px|thumb|center| PCB Schematic]]\n\n===Implementation===\n====PCB Design====\nA PCB was designed that includes the evaluation charging circuit, relays and battery connections.

Our goal is to develop a better and more efficient method that not only satisfies the design requirements but also does not require the stocking of specialized parts that have little to no variability in design.\n\n===Background===\n'''Why Heat a drain pan?'''\nCool air at or below freezing temperatures can condense frost on the drain pan, during a defrost cycle the pan is preheated to a desired temperature above freezing so that the ice-melt from the condenser does not refreeze upon hitting the drain pan and can quickly leave through a drain.\n\nIf this process is incomplete ice buildup occurs resulting in a solid block of ice that can no longer be melted in a typical defrost cycle.\nThe other concern is when too much heat is being applied to the pan, this will result in turning some of the water into steam as well as introduces excess heat into the room that must be removed after the defrost cycle.\n\nA major part of our goals is to find the ideal conditions that minimize excess heat to the room while preventing issues that occur from incomplete defrost.\n\n'''Current Methods'''\nThere are currently two common methods and their known issues:\n;Hot Gas\n:Costs of pressure rated pipe and the installation is high\n:Borderline effective below -30 F\n;Electric Resistance Rods\n:Often provides substantially more heat than necessary\n:Most suppliers provide only predetermined shapes and dimensions\n\n===Deliverables===\n<li>Specify the most effective heating method<\/li>\n<li>Apply the Proposed Solution to a demonstration pan to test effectiveness<\/li>\n<li>Specify spacing configuration of heating elements<\/li>\n<li>Thermal mass balance to determine melting rate of ice chunks<\/li>\n<li>Detailed report discussing heating options, reason for choosing final design, and evaluation of final product<\/li>\n===Specifications===\n<li>Electric heat for drain pan only<\/li>\n<li>Average room temperature -30 F<\/li>\n<li>Heater(s) to be sized for the power draw similar to cooling fan motors<\/li>\n<li>Solution must be reliable, durable, and quickly and easily installed<\/li>\n\n==Project Learning==\n[[File:2014_TCoils_HeatTransfer_Sketch.png|thumb|Basic Heat Transfer Analysis]]\nOver the course of the semester we have learned about several alternatives that we will be perusing, during this semester we focused primarily on understanding and experimentation on the current design for a basis for quantitative measurement for the performance of not only their current system, but also analysis of the alternatives we will be evaluating.\n\nFor our heat transfer analysis we are utilizing real time collected data using a current logger and thermocouples as well as a thermal camera to provide upper and lower bounds to the transfer of heat using the following equations:\n\n<math>Q_{upper}=I^2 R<\/math>\n\n<math>Q_{lower}=Q_{conv}+Q_{cond}+Q_{rad}<\/math>\n\n<math>Q_{conv}=h A (T_{(L)}-T_\\infty)<\/math>\n\n<math>Q_{cond}=k L (T_{(L)}-T_\\infty)<\/math>\n\n<math>Q_{rad}=\\sigma (T_{(L)}^4-T_\\infty ^4)<\/math>\n\n==Team Information==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border-style: solid;

However, both are essentially the same and will fit in the same tapped hole (provided the hole is tapped according to the respective size).  This can cause confusion as two threads with different pitch diameters but the same thread diameter will appear to be of the same size but will not fit in the same tapped hole.  Therefore, when working with threads it is important to fully understand this concept.

This reduced immune response may lead to poor wound healing or the inability to fight infections. Infections are one of the most common reported complications of the diabetic foot. Early treatment of infection is a critical component to success. If neglected, an infection of the foot can cause gangrene, ulceration, osteomyelitis (bone infection), and even amputation.","timestamp":"20151010000314","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"4","title":"Administrators","comment":"Created page with \"Make user changes using Special:UserRights\"","content":"Make user changes using Special:UserRights","timestamp":"20151010200231","user-timestamp":"20150724170830","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Gavin_photo.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20151013031302","user-timestamp":"20150917225958","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"2015_KodiakCub_navio.png","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20151013034324","user-timestamp":"20150914052541","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"2","title":"Bort7296","comment":"Created page with \"Jason Borth bort7296@vandals.uidaho.edu ~~~~ Jason Borth\"","content":"Jason Borth\nbort7296@vandals.uidaho.edu\n[[User:Bort7296|Bort7296]] ([[User talk:Bort7296|talk]]) 16:06, 14 October 2015 (UTC) Jason Borth","timestamp":"20151014160615","user-timestamp":"20151014155652","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"How_To_Choose_The_Perfect_Tennis_Shoes","comment":"Created page with \"Sandals being one of the comfy footwear, many prefer to opt for it.

While you shop for one this time, do look for sandals with arch support which are comfy, good for foot and stylish as well. Shoes for high arches are special of kind that some individuals must use, in order to protect their feet from injuries. What are the benefits of orthopedic shoes?<br><br>Often, significant flat feet will need custom functional orthotics and physical therapy for more aggressive symptomatic relief. For more foot health tips or for doctor-approved foot care products, visit my website or peruse my blog! Upon meeting with a general orthopaedic doctor\/surgeon about your flat feet, he or she will ask you to perform various poses to see if a foot arch exists.<br><br>Achilles tendonitis also happens frequently in runners who perform their training in sturdy training shoes with elevated heels (all running\u00a0training shoes), and then do a race or fast training in a race flat or\u00a0spike that often has little to no heel elevation.  This causes the\u00a0Achilles tendons to have to stretch up to an inch more than they were\u00a0used to, due to the training shoe artificially elevating the heel. The same situation is seen in women who usually wear shoes with high\u00a0heels and then attempt to wear a shoe with a lower heel. Only removing the cause of the inflammation will relieve the pain and inflammation encountered in this situation, which are the shoes. As well, I workout at home bear foot.<br><br>Toe Points - While sitting or laying, point at something in the room with your toes and flex (tense) for 5 seconds, then relax. Toe Walks - Get on your tip toes (in bare feet, obviously :p ) and walk around for five minutes. Adult acquired flatfoot is a painful condition occurring in one foot.<br><br>Luckily, there is a way to run without pain without sacrificing pain. All of the leading shoe manufacturers make running shoes designed specifically for flat footed runners. Stability shoes offer ample mid-sole cushioning, while still offering support and durability. The most popular stability shoe is the Nike Zoom Structure Triax + 15. The Asics Gel 2170 is also a reasonably priced shoe perfect for people with low arches. Motion Control shoes offer more support than stability shoes and are excellent for heavier joggers and walkers.<br><br>If the strip is very thin and only a thin strip of the little toe side of the foot can be seen (or none at all) you most likely have a high arch. To get a true assessment, you should see a pedorthist, podiatrist, physician, or other qualified specialist. If you are certain that you have a flat foot or flat feet, a good over the counter arch support designed specifically for flat feet is an excellent form of treatment. Applying ice to the sore area of your foot and\/or taking anti-inflammatory drugs may provide temporary relief. However, when you have a flat foot, your mechanics in walking and foot alignment are usually poor.<br><br>Without proper arch support, you can have pain in your heels, arch, and leg. You can also develop bunions and hammertoes, which can become painful,\" says Marlene Reid, a podiatrist, or foot and ankle doctor, in Naperville, IL.

An isolated subspecies in the Columbia River Basin is listed as endangered by the United States.<ref>Pygmy rabbit - Wikipedia[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pygmy_rabbit]<\/ref>. The burrowing owls of North America, who raise their young in burrows dug by other animals<ref>Burrowing Owl - Wikipedia[https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Burrowing_owl]<\/ref>, are also of interest to researchers at the University of Idaho.\nCurrent methods for exploring burrows are either ineffective or invasive, with the leading tool for exploration being a camera attached to a single flexible rod. This limits the type of structures the device can enter and the depth it can reach.\nThe goal of this project is to design and build a device that can enter a burrow to collect video, volume measurements, and a 3D map of the structure.\nThe current iteration of the project aims to write a software interface for controlling the vehicle designed in 2014-15 and collecting data.\n\n\n\n\n==Problem Definition==\n\n===Background=== \n     \nThe pygmy rabbit digs burrows into the ground, which help to keep it safe from predators and the cold winters of its environment. These burrows are important to the pygmy rabbit, but they are also very important to the local ecosystem. The burrows are often used as shelter for other animals who cannot dig their own burrows. They also have an impact on soil density, temperature and water retention, which impacts surrounding plant life.\n\nThe pygmy rabbit has a very strong impact on the plants and animals of its environment, and as such is important to study. Some important data on the rabbit burrows is presented below:\n\n* Burrow diameter between three and eighteen inches\n* On average, each burrow has between three and five entrances, with an expected maximum of fourteen entrances\n* Each burrow is between a meter and one and one-half meters under ground\n* Each burrow entrance will be between two and three meters away from other entrances\n\nThe Burrowing Owls utilize much simpler structures that often consist of a single entrance and a lower expected depth.\n\n===2014 Vehicle Specifications===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

This could pose a problem for burrows up to 18in. (46cm) wide or at junctions.\n* The computer in the vehicle has a 454 MHz ARM processor and 64 MB of RAM.\n* The following hardware items had not yet been addressed and were included on the \"To-Do\" List given us:\n** Mount LED light source\n** Construct a durable, keyed tether for burrow exploration\n** Attach accelerometer\n** Mount range finder array\n** Purchase a connector for battery charging\n** Wire in begin and stop recording commands, utilizing the existing button on the DVR\n** Identify the correct camera failure modes\n** Install an external power switch.\n* In addition, we noted that the forward camera was not wired to anything.\n* The following software items were included on the \"To-Do\" List:\n** Create a comprehensive user interface\n** Write code for sensor data storage\n** Implement a method to create a 3D map from points obtained by sensor readings\n** Implement a method for estimating burrow volume\n* The file \"Tech Presentation Final\" suggests black and white 640x480 video is captured, whereas the wiki indicated 1280x720 video.\n* Battery recharges in about 1.5 hours from \"almost any power source\", though it's not clear what that means, since the \"To-Do\" List included purchasing an adapter for charging.\n* The existing C code included the following keyboard commands for controlling the vehicle, which certainly don't satisfy the requirement for a simple interface:\n** 'w', 'a', 's', and 'd' to move forward, turn left, move back, and turn right (all at half speed)\n** 'u' and 'h' to veer left and right (at half speed)\n** 'l' and 'h' for veering backwards (at half speed)\n** Capital letter equivalents for full speed\n** 'Y' to stop\n\n===Range Sensor Analysis===\n'''Objective:'''\nDetermine the accuracy and maximum range that can be expected from the range sensors purchased by the 2014-15 team.\n\n'''Methodology:'''\nUsing surfaces or varying reflectance, plot true values of distance between a sensor and the surface against the measured values returned by the sensor.\n\n'''Findings and Analysis:'''\n[[File:2015_RabMap_RangeSensorPerformance.png|400px|thumb|Range Sensor Performance]]\nThe observed maximum sensor range was about 15cm. In cases where a burrow is 18in. (46cm) wide, this will still not reach halfway across the tunnel. However, this is significantly better than the 10cm. range suggested by the specifications from the vendor. The small maximum range may still negatively impact the vehicle's ability to create maps and estimate burrow volume. The minimum accurate range appears to be 1cm. This should be acceptable most of the time, since only some portions of the burrows should be so small that the vehicle can barely traverse through them. Additionally, the error at distances that small should not significantly impact the relative error of volume estimates. In nearly all cases, the observed error was less than 1cm, and was much lower for surfaces of higher reflectance. While this could pose problems in a dirt environment, the error is fairly marginal.\n\n==Design==\n\n==Personnel Information==\n===Team Members===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" border=\"2\"\n!

Although soccer can be an entertaining form of exercise, the running and jumping involved can put you at risk for injuries and conditions that cause heel pain. Last year, 30% of my son's football team missed games because of\u00a0heel pain & Sever's. Aging is a natural phenomenon in a human lifecycle.<br><br>Ultrasound-guided needle fasciotomy is the least invasive type of surgical procedure wherein a needle inserted into the plantar fascia strikes back and forth in order to break the fibrous tissue. Plantar fascia release being the final surgical resort principally permits decompression of the afflicted FDB muscle belly, though it does not fix the very primary underlying cause; and could even lead to problems comprising straightening of the arch and pain owing to cuboid bone compression. However, it may be caused by the sudden stretching of the over tight plantar fascia or an over tight Achilles tendon, which also connects to the heel bone.<br><br>Sever's Disease is not an actual disease and their are several ways to help relieve the pain associate with this very common biomechanical condition. Heel pain is generally the result of faulty biomechanics (walking gait abnormalities) that place too much stress on the heel bone and the soft tissues that attach to it. The stress may also result from injury, or a bruise incurred while walking, running, or jumping on hard surfaces; wearing poorly constructed footwear (such as flimsy flip-flops); or being overweight.<br><br>In my case, the plantar fascia was inflamed and perhaps, there were some fiber tissues that were torn. On my blog at , I posted the exercises that I did that minimized the pain in my foot. Unfortunately, most people spend 100% of every day standing, walking and moving on these hard surfaces. What makes matters worse is most shoes worn today offer poor support. This creates the perfect recipe for foot pain and, ultimately, plantar fasciitis. This is the option when pain is severe and lasting.<br><br>It is the inflammation of the plantar fascia tissues which is present in the base of the foot and extends from toe to the heel. Pain in the heel is mostly observed in the people who have problems with the arches of the foot. Pain increases in the morning as you use your heal after a long rest and decreases when you walk for a while as the plantar fascia gets stretched. Over weight people or obese people experience heel pain very frequently. This is because there is an overload in the feet muscles which might result in inflamed muscles and tissues. Running long distance or on the hard surface like concrete, sudden regress exercise or physical activity, etc., can also take you to burning pain in heel.<br><br>This group of patients have very tight calf muscles which means their foot is permanently in a 'pointed toe' position. The muscles and tendons around the heel are therefore not able to relax and become terribly inflamed. In summary, heel pain is very common and for many people, will go away after taking very simple measures. However if your pain continues after six months, you should see a foot and ankle specialist rather than enduring debilitating pain which is likely to worsen over time. The retrocalcaneal bursa is positioned to allow the Achilles tendon to glide over the back part (posterior aspect) of the heel bone. This inflammation results in exquisite tenderness along the posterior aspect of the heel.","timestamp":"20151027204437","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"MINUTES_Fly_Rollers_Meeting_7_10-22-15.pdf","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20151027220504","user-timestamp":"20150917225958","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"MINUTES_Fly_Rollers_Meeting_6_10-15-15.pdf","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20151027220806","user-timestamp":"20150917225958","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"MINUTES_Fly_Rollers_Meeting_5_10-8-15.pdf","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20151027220818","user-timestamp":"20150917225958","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"2015_ImpactTestingDevice_sketch1.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20151027222542","user-timestamp":"20151014155652","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"2015_ImpactTestingDevice_sketch2.JPG","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20151027222557","user-timestamp":"20151014155652","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"2015_ImpactTestingDevice_sketch3.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20151027222619","user-timestamp":"20151014155652","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Fleet_Service_Responder","comment":"Test","content":"This is a '''test'''","timestamp":"20151027223530","user-timestamp":"20151027222327","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Persistence_of_Vision_Machine","comment":"Created page with \"Persistence of vision refers to the optical illusion whereby multiple discrete images blend into a single image in the human mind and believed to be the explanation for motion...\"","content":"Persistence of vision refers to the optical illusion whereby multiple discrete images blend into a single image in the human mind and believed to be the explanation for motion perception in cinema and animated films.

The battery packs and the control system of the sub will be enclosed respectively in two waterproof cylinders. The external sensors and motors of the sub will be attached to the frame. All connections between power, control, and sensors will be done with cables running through through waterproof ports.\n===Thrusters===\nThe sub is outfitted with six thrusters which will be able to control all movement in the xyz plane as well as roll (rotating around forward axis) and pitch\/yaw (incline from fore to aft). The thrusters will be directly controlled by the microcontrollers based on commands sent from the PC.\n===Sensors===\nThe sub is outfitted with numerous sensors including audio (three hydrophones), visual (four cameras), accelerometer, magnetometer (compass), thermometer, depth sensor, gyroscope. All sensors other than visual\/audio, which feed directly into the PC, will be polled by a microcontroller at regular intervals. The microcontroller will create a packet with the sensor reading and device information which will be sent to the PC.\n===Grabbing Arms===\n[[File:2014 robosub Marker Dropper.jpg|thumb|left]]\nThe sub has two grabbing arms, each of which is controlled with a stepper motor; one in front and one on the bottom. The front claw also functions as the marker dropper.  As the marker dropper tasks will be completed before the grabbing tasks, the arm will being at fully open and then as it closes will drop the first and then the second marker before closing fully. By telling the arm to close only a certain amount the dropping of the first and second markers can be controlled.\n===Torpedo Launchers===\n[[File:2014 robosub Pneumatic System.jpg|thumb|left]]\nThe sub has two pneumatically controlled torpedo launchers pointing forward. They are actuated by signals from one of the microcontrollers. The compressed air canister that powers the launchers is situated so that it can be quickly and easily replaced.\n===Control System===\nAll sensor and motor functions within the sub are managed by PIC32 microcontrollers, with the exception of the visual and audio sensors which are fed directly to the PC. The PIC32 polls each sensor in series at times based on timer interrupts, packages the data with an identifying header and sends it to the PC through an I2C connection. The PC processes the data and the AI software identifies which motor commands are required. The command packet is sent to the PIC32s over in I2C bus. The packet contains a header specifying the target devices so that the microcontroller will know where to send it.\n===Movement Module Prototype===\n'''The movement module prototype is required to do the following to be useful to the system that was previously described:'''\n::* Gather key events from a keyboard, including single key events, or a polling event in the case of a continuously held key.\n::* Regulate the amount of events processed and data broadcasted as to not overload the socket communication module with too many requests. This feature is required to share the broadcaster and socket communication with the other parallel executing modules. \n::* Evaluate the appropriate movement logic to execute a maneuver effectively.\n::* Produce the required data to be broadcasted back to the micro-controller which will control the thrusters by providing a values to activate each thruster and the its power level.\n===User Input Movement Module: Tested===\n'''The user input movement module has been rewritten to integrate with the other python modules and the updated architecture.'''\n::* Movement is now handled as X,Y,Z values over three fields: location, orientation, and velocity\n::* The updated architecture has removed the broadcaster and now relies on inter-module communication handled by 0MQ and\na message process called the \"grapevine\" which communicates messages to the new logging module and others.\n::* The new X,Y,Z values are contained within Python dictionaries with the intent of being more friendly to future implementation of automated movement and AI integration.\n<br>\n\n==Team Members==\n{| width=\"100%\" border=\"2\"\n|-\n!

Allow the sub to respond to keyboard input'''\n::* Include program that will accept keyboard and act on keyboard input\n\n'''17. Thrusters will respond to input from the sub'''\n::* Program will activate the thrusters to execute a task\n==Current Design==\n[[File:2014 robosub Frame Underside.jpg|thumb|left]]\n===Sub Frame===\n[[File:2014 robosub Hull.jpg|thumb|left]]\nThe frame is constructed principally from extruded aluminum beams to which the various other components will be secured. The battery packs and the control system of the sub will be enclosed respectively in two waterproof cylinders. The external sensors and motors of the sub will be attached to the frame. All connections between power, control, and sensors will be done with cables running through through waterproof ports.\n===Thrusters===\nThe sub is outfitted with six thrusters which will be able to control all movement in the xyz plane as well as roll (rotating around forward axis) and pitch\/yaw (incline from fore to aft). The thrusters will be directly controlled by the microcontrollers based on commands sent from the PC.\n===Sensors===\nThe sub is outfitted with numerous sensors including audio (three hydrophones), visual (four cameras), accelerometer, magnetometer (compass), thermometer, depth sensor, gyroscope. All sensors other than visual\/audio, which feed directly into the PC, will be polled by a microcontroller at regular intervals. The microcontroller will create a packet with the sensor reading and device information which will be sent to the PC.\n===Grabbing Arms===\n[[File:2014 robosub Marker Dropper.jpg|thumb|left]]\nThe sub has two grabbing arms, each of which is controlled with a stepper motor; one in front and one on the bottom. The front claw also functions as the marker dropper.  As the marker dropper tasks will be completed before the grabbing tasks, the arm will being at fully open and then as it closes will drop the first and then the second marker before closing fully. By telling the arm to close only a certain amount the dropping of the first and second markers can be controlled.\n===Torpedo Launchers===\n[[File:2014 robosub Pneumatic System.jpg|thumb|left]]\nThe sub has two pneumatically controlled torpedo launchers pointing forward. They are actuated by signals from one of the microcontrollers. The compressed air canister that powers the launchers is situated so that it can be quickly and easily replaced.\n===Control System===\nAll sensor and motor functions within the sub are managed by PIC32 microcontrollers, with the exception of the visual and audio sensors which are fed directly to the PC. The PIC32 polls each sensor in series at times based on timer interrupts, packages the data with an identifying header and sends it to the PC through an I2C connection. The PC processes the data and the AI software identifies which motor commands are required. The command packet is sent to the PIC32s over in I2C bus. The packet contains a header specifying the target devices so that the microcontroller will know where to send it.\n===Movement Module Prototype===\n'''The movement module prototype is required to do the following to be useful to the system that was previously described:'''\n::* Gather key events from a keyboard, including single key events, or a polling event in the case of a continuously held key.\n::* Regulate the amount of events processed and data broadcasted as to not overload the socket communication module with too many requests. This feature is required to share the broadcaster and socket communication with the other parallel executing modules. \n::* Evaluate the appropriate movement logic to execute a maneuver effectively.\n::* Produce the required data to be broadcasted back to the micro-controller which will control the thrusters by providing a values to activate each thruster and the its power level.\n===User Input Movement Module: Tested===\n'''The user input movement module has been rewritten to integrate with the other python modules and the updated architecture.'''\n::* Movement is now handled as X,Y,Z values over three fields: location, orientation, and velocity\n::* The updated architecture has removed the broadcaster and now relies on inter-module communication handled by 0MQ and\na message process called the \"grapevine\" which communicates messages to the new logging module and others.\n::* The new X,Y,Z values are contained within Python dictionaries with the intent of being more friendly to future implementation of automated movement and AI integration.\n<br>\n\n==Team Members==\n{| width=\"100%\" border=\"2\"\n|-\n!

Because of this the bots are simple to build while allowing for robust software development.\n\n==Problem Definition==\nThe goal for the project this semester is to implement functional communication between the two bots using Android based phones and Xbee chips on the Arduino board of each bot. \n\n===Background===\n\n===Deliverables===\n\n===Specifications===\n\n==Project Learning==\n\n==Team

page and project information","content":"==Project Task==\nCreate an information portal at the college of engineering that students and visitors may use to experience information about the college.  This portal should be interactive and even attract people to the college.\n\n===Task List===\n#Design a medium for displaying our user interface.\n#Design a user interface that is appealing both in usability and presentation.\n#Create the display and integrate the user interface into it.\n\n==Display Design==\nIn this task we considered several options from a simple 40\" touchscreen to virtual reality.  We decided that the technology in virtual reality was not quite complete enough yet and a 40\" touchscreen was too small and didn't deliver enough of a \"WOW\" factor.  Instead we settled on something we think will match the aesthetic of the Think Tank which is just around the corner from the hallway where our display will be placed.\n\nThe design we chose is to project our UI onto a large glass pane from behind.  This will give the illusion of the glass being the object displaying the UI much like what is seen in many sci-fi films.  In order to make this display interactive, we need to implement a way to interact with it.  For this we will be using Ubi Interactive which uses a short throw camera and a laser sensor to read touch events on the displayed surface.  With this hardware we can detect up to 20 touch points, allowing for a maximum of 10 concurrent users.\n\nThis display will be placed on top of a wooden or metal kick box to keep users from accidentally kicking or shattering the glass.  It will also serve as cover for concealing the projector, computer and any other cables from view.\n\n===Parts List===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Projector\n! Glass\n! Rear-Projection Film\n|-\n| Casio XJ-UT310WN\n| Tempered\n| \n|-\n| \n*Ultra-Short Throw 0.27:1\n*LED\/Lazer Hybrid lamp\n*20,000 hr half life\n*1280 x 800 resolution\n| \n*9.5' x 5.5' x 1\/4\"\n*Safer\/tougher than normal glass\n*More scratch resistant than plexiglass \n| \n|-\n! Touch Interface\n! Kick Box\n! Computer\n|-\n| Ubi Interactive\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n*Touchscreen interaction for any surface\n*20 touchpoints\n*Easy to hide behind screen\n*Ultra-short throw camera\n|\n|\n|}\n\n===Display Design Concepts===\n[[File:concept_diagram.png|x350px|A diagram showing the setup of the display.]]\n[[File:concept_example.png|x350px|An example of the display in in use.]]\n\n\n==User Interface Design==\nThe UI for this project needs to be a living UI, meaning it needs to move and display useful information while not in use.  It also needs to be easy to understand and navigate for the user.  Because of this we are planning on using a \"live tile\" system, where bits of useful information are displayed periodically on their respective tile.  We are also thinking about developing this as a three-dimensional tree structure where the user is flown\/zoomed into the next layer of whichever menu options they choose.  We also need to consider how information will be updated after we leave and for this we want to make a separate UI for adding information more easily.\n\n===UI Parts===\n*User experience UI\n*Admin editing UI\n\n===User Experience UI===\nFor the user experience we are planning on offering these options:\n*Map of engineering building\/campus\n*Map and information on parking\n*History of programs with timelines and photos\n*History of Deans of the college of engineering with timelines and photos\n*Faculty of the college of engineering\n*Academy of Engineering members\n*Class schedules and rooms\n*Student clubs in the college\n*Information on majors\n*NAE Grand Challenges\n*Events list\/calendar\nMore will be added to this list as we think of them.\n\nBecause our display will reach up to the ceiling, we recognize that most people cannot reach that high.  For this reason, this part of the screen will not be interactive.  Instead, it will scroll useful information across it much like that of a news feed.  Some of the information that can be displayed here is:\n*Class cancellations\n*Engineering events for the week\n*Teachers with office hours at that time\n*Weather information\n*Club meetings\n*Etc.","timestamp":"20151030215253","user-timestamp":"20150505180944","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Ddaigle2.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20151030215614","user-timestamp":"20151030215101","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"RTS-01.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20151030224910","user-timestamp":"20151029213642","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Electrical_MCU.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20151030230252","user-timestamp":"20140527174826","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Alan_Photo.jpeg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20151031055302","user-timestamp":"20150603175907","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"2015_BiodieselReactor_CameronSnow.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20151103051542","user-timestamp":"20151027231054","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"2015_BiodieselReactor_EthanScott.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20151103051727","user-timestamp":"20151027231054","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"2015_BiodieselReactor_GregStanderford.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20151103051830","user-timestamp":"20151027231054","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"2015_BiodieselReactor_JessicaCurtis.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20151103052608","user-timestamp":"20151027231054","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"2015_BiodieselReactor_TemporaryPic.jpeg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20151103053446","user-timestamp":"20151027231054","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"2015_BiodieselReactor_QuaidMurray.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20151103053841","user-timestamp":"20151027231054","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Lane_Photo.jpeg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20151103060617","user-timestamp":"20150603175907","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Andy_Photo.jpeg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20151103060821","user-timestamp":"20150603175907","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"2015_BiodieselReactor_JessicaCurtis1.jpg","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20151103062648","user-timestamp":"20151027231054","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"2015_ImpactTestingDevice_MM10-29-15.pdf","comment":"","content":"","timestamp":"20151103193137","user-timestamp":"20151014155652","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"1","title":"Formula_Hybrid_Car_(FHSAE)_2015-2016","comment":"Created page with \"Comments:  -

Two trainers will be strapped inside the simulator using seatbelts and will be pushed into a pool. Other assistances in the pool will hold down the simulator until it reaches the pool\u2019s floor. They will give a signal to the trainers in the simulator so they start unstrapping the seatbelt and egress from the sides of the simulator.\n\n\n== Problem Definition ==\n===Problem Statement===\nThe current design of the simulator works perfectly as needed. However, there are some problems that occur in the current design. Department of Interior reports that the current simulator suffers from breaking joints and that problem caused by the materials used to design the simulator, which is PVC. The pictures below show the areas where joint exactly broken.\n===Goal===\nThe goal of the project is to design a simulator that will be lighter, stronger, easy to assemble and disassemble, transportable and affordable. \n===Background===\nPicture of the client or something related to the client if possible\nAccording to Rick Gividen, chief training division at the U.S. Department of the Interior, the idea came after two accidents occurred at the U.S. Department of the Interior in 2010 and 2013 where the pilots hardly escaped from the plane. Now, new pilots at the U.S. Department of the Interior have to go through a course where they are strapped in the simulator and pushed into a pool then try to escape from simulator.\nAs a result, the U.S. Department of the Interior demands such simulators that could be stronger that the current design. The reason of that is simulators are shipped from a city to another city and maybe from a state to another state. Shipping is one of the reasons why the current simulator has cracks and breaking joints.\n\n=== Specifications===\nCapacity: Seat 2 people 5\u2019 \u2013 6\u20194\u201d comfortably 4\u20196\u201d \u2013 6\u20199\u201d uncomfortably.\nWater Proof: Components should be water proofed and corrosion resistince. \nShipping Boxes: Final contents of shipping must not exceed 75 lbs. \/box and 108\" in length and 165\" in length plus girth.\nToleration: Broken assemblies both through shipping or use must be economically feasible and field reparable. 50% weight variance between seats.  I.e. 300 lbs.\/150lbs seat.\nCost: Less than the cost of current (pipe + fittings + seats + seatbelts + netting + glue + labor) + cases = $2,217.8.\nSeat Criteria: Seat up to 500 lbs. total. Seating either tandem or side by side.\nAssembly: Assemble in less than 1 hour.\nDisassembly: Disassemble in less than 1 hour.\n\n==New Design==\nThe new design will be made out of aluminum and not PVC. Specifically, aluminum T-Slots that will allow us to assemble and disassemble the simulator by tightening and loosing screws. Aluminum is a material that has very good corrosion resistance as well as reasonable weight. Moreover, aluminum is not a rare material so it doesn\u2019t cost much. It is also a tough material that doesn\u2019t bend or break easily.\nInclude a drawing that indicates the measurement of all components\nInclude stress and bending analysis picture\nWhen the group proposed to the client about using aluminum T-Slots instead of PVC, there were a lot of concerns of whether using such material will damage the floor when pushing the simulator to the pool. Also, sharp edges might be dangerous while assembling and disassembling.\nAfter reviewing questions and concerns from our client, we have purchased Plastic Strips that could be attached at the bottom of the simulator, which will make the simulator slip easily and smoothly as well. Moreover, Caps also we purchased to cover the sharp edges that the client were concerned about.\nPicture of the plastic strips and caps\n\n==Project Learning==\n\n== Team Information ==\n\n{|
