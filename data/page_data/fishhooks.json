Milo is self-described a \"party guy\" who tries to have fun on any situations. He is very loud and loves to go on wild adventures and throw parties. He's 16 years old, and is friends with Bea, a female who is an aspiring actress, and is also very friendly with his brother, Oscar, who is very nervous when it comes to girls, and loves to play video games.In \"Fail Fish\", Milo is shown to have attention disables, and passed his test with the help of Bea and Oscar, who did dangerous stuff cause that's how Milo learns.He's afraid of losing Bea, as shown in \"Fish Sleepover Party\".So he and Oscar disguised as girls to sneak to thier party.He, as stated by Mr. Baldwin, is a \"selfish fish\".In \"Fish Out Of Water\", he ventered outside the tanks in watersuits, along with Oscar and Bea.In \"Underwater Boy\", he tries out for football to get attention, but ends up as water boy.He thought Mr. Baldwin was the comic superhero, Captain Aquarium.He got a dog for Oscar named Murphy, and Oscar drove him away, so Milo, Bea, and Oscar try to find him.At the end of the episode, Milo got a horse.He is knowned by Oscar, as lazy, as he doesn't wash his underwear.[[File:FishHooksCast.jpg|thum|right|Milo,Oscar,and Bea]]\n\n====Bea Goldfishberg====\n([[Chelsea Stuab]])is a goldfish who is very \"overly dramatic\", and wants to be a movie star. Her friend, Oscar, has a huge and regularly unspoken crush on her, and she is obviously oblivious to this. She even once said Oscar is her boyfriend, but it turns out she was just \"acting\" so Clamantha could get away from Oscar. However, she may have some feelings for his brother, Milo, due to their close bond and her constant concern of him. She claims that she is the most beautiful fish of all time, despite her friends not agreeing so. In the episode \"Underwater Boy\", it is shown that she is a fan of football. As shown in several episodes, both her parents are extremely overprotective of her and treat her like a baby, so she once tried to take a job at Fish Flakes inc., but eventually get's sick of it and quits.When the students had to give presents in Jocktopuses birthday, Bea says she's too talented to be punched, and tells a really long story about her being a \"delivery female\" to distract Jocktopus. She doesn't mind going on adventures, as long as she could be with her friends. She really close to her best friend, Shellsea, as they always chat and hang out.Bea seems to be a dramatic to most situations, like when she and Milo tried to sneak in Clamantha's yearbook office, but it turns out her picture was perfectly fine. She's the tritagonist of the show. She is 16.\n\n====Oscar Fishtooth====\n\nOscar(voiced by Justin Roiland) is the brother of Milo and a routinely nervous fish who Clamantha, a student of Freshwater High, is infatuated with and has opened a shrine to.[3] He is a video game lover and has a good relationship with Bea and mostly Milo (due to their brotherhood). Oscar is hyper and crazy a lot throughout the series, mostly cause of Milo's crazy adventures. Similar to Clamantha, he has opened a shrine to his crush, Bea. He doesn't exactly want anybody to notice he has a crush on her, like when Bea saw his drawing of them, he snatched it and ripped it to pieces.Though he would like her to notice. He's 16 years old. In the episode Doggonit after he yells at Murphy causing him to run away Oscar reveals that he is half beta fish, and that he didnt mean what he said because beta fish are very passionate. He is terrified of Clamantha, as she has a crush on him, in which he dispites. Oscar gave money to Jocktopus on his birthday, but Jocktopus calls it \"worthless paper', so Oscar gets tangled up in trouble. He made up a fake girlfriend named Doris Flors Gorgeous so he doesn't have to worry about not going on dates with nobody.Unlike his brother Milo, he doesn't like to go on adventures, and only does cause Milo or Bea asks him to, so that makes Oscar more of a neutral character. He is the deuteragonist of the series.\n\n====Secondary Chrachters====\n\n====Clamantha,the teenage clam====\nClamantha(voiced by Alex Hirsch)is a crazy clam who attends Freshwater High. She is friends with Bea and often gives her \"pearls of wisdom\". Clamantha has an obsessive crush on Oscar, almost to point of insanity, therefore Oscar is afraid of her.Her locker even has a shrine dedicate to him. In the episode Bea Stays in the Picture,Oscar had to distract Clamantha so Bea could get her yearbook picture.Clamantha then got on a date with Oscar in the Hokey Poke Diner, and later to Lovers Tank. Bea then said Oscar was her boyfriend, so Clamantha told Oscar to get out of her car. Clamantha wants to be a cheerleader and likes to spit out pearls. She refers to herself as a clam whenever she can. In the episode \"Doris Flores Gorgeous\", she had on a costume that gave her the appearance of Oscar's dream girl so she was able to kiss him. She is the only girl in the class, as Oscar's the only boy in his class who doesn't have a boyfriend or girlfriend. When Bea needed entertainment for the fake school dance, Clamantha volunteered to play music, in which she has a band called \"Clamantha and the Shiny Objects\". Clamantha was invited to Bea's sleepover party and didn't notice Milo and Oscar was on girl disguises to the point of exploding out of confussion. She, along with other girls tried to help Milo study, but Clamantha coudn't remember her line. Her catchphraise is \"I'm a clam!\", which she says throughout the series.\n\n\n====Jocktopus====\nJocktopus Ludwig Vandenbush(voiced by John DiMaggio)is the school bully that is an octopus and the show's primary antagonist. He isn't the brightest crayon in the box but he makes up for his lack of intelligence with his muscles. He thinks learning is \"boring\". Although grades isn't his strong point, he supports Freshwater High by playing on the school football team with his gang of Pass, Punt and Fumble. Jocktopus always speaks in the third person. He had his first major role in Underwater Boy, where he doesn't appereciate Milo's \"skills' when he did the tryouts, but later cheers for him after they won the game. He then appears in Happy Birthfish, Jocktopus, which is a episode all around him. After Milo, Bea, and Oscar saw what happened to Sunny after he gave Jocktopus his money, Oscar puts all the money in his hair. Bea then quickly shoves Oscar to Jocktopus, and he soon finds out that Oscar is smart, as he helped him with his bullying by making cards, a dice, and a machine that randomely selects Jocktopuses next victimn. When the device selects Milo and Bea, Oscar tries to prevent Jocktopus from beating them up, so he makes the machine get on Jocktopus, so he starts beating himself up. Oscar gets n trouble with Jocktous again when Milo told him to laugh at everything. He did, but he put it too far when he was accedently laughing at Jocktopus\n\n\n====Shellsea====\nShellsea(voiced by Kari Wahlgren)Every girl has a best friend, and for Bea it's Shellsea. She is a fashion lover and always has time for a disco nap. She is usually the one to snap Bea out her over-dramatic eccentric episodes, but at the same time agree with her. Se says \"giiiirrrrrlll\" a lot in the series. When Bea is not hanging out with Milo and Oscar,she will always be with Shellsea. Shellsea had her first appearance in Fish Sleepover Party, where she was invited to Bea's sleepover party. When Milo andOscar came along and dressed as girls, she was the one who told Bea to torture them. So they give them mudbaths, and comfort food and other girly stuff. She was having a lunch date with Steve Jackson, one of the most popular fish in her class. While the football team was playing, Shellsea was in the crowd, along with Bea, cheering thier team. Bea was jealous of Shellsea's hair. When Bea tried to become an adult, Shellsea gave her shoulder pads and makeup to make her look like one. She tried to help Milo study for the test. She likes to stretch out her words when she speaks(ex:ca-raay-zaay) She is a jewelfish. Shellsea enjoyes dancing, singing, picking out who is less attractive than her in the yearbook, and of course hanging out with her best friend, Bea.\n\n====Mr.Baldwin====\nMr. Baldwin(voiced by Dana Snyder)is the teacher of Milo, Bea and Oscar, who is a seahorse[3] and is down in the dumps about his life, along with the fact of him being pregnant.He is grouchy,gloomy and seems to make his students bored in class. His lectures are often boring and usually puts himself to sleep. He has a negative feeling about Milo, due to him interrupting the class and not paying attention.In Fish Out of Water, he thinks Milo is a \"selfish fish\" and doesn't like his entrance in the class. He put Albert in detention for staying in the hallway too long. He's a serious teacher who doesn't like jokes. He also got a job at Fish Flakes inc. He had his biggest role in Baldwin the Super Fish, cause Milo thought Mr. Baldwin was a comic superhero who fights for crime and justice. So Milo, Bea, and Oscar tried to tak pictures and spied on him for Bea's journalismn story.When he doesn't do anything heroic, Milo lets Oscar disguised as a villain and he trapped himself in a glass cup full of water. Bea took a picture, which made Mr. Baldwin stunned and he accedently let go of the cup, so everyone fell into the shark tank. The sharks were vegetarians so they didn't eat them\n\n====Coach Salmons====\nCoach Salmons(voiced by Richard Simmons)is a salmon[3] and the enthusiastic physical education coach and is quick to offer motivation or a diagram of the food pyramid. He is probably a parody of his actor, Richard Simmons.His catchphraise is \"move your fins.\" He is a kind and friendly teacher who believes that everybody is special. He enjoys spicing up boring exercize routines and likes students who always tries thier best and doesn't give up. When Milo signed up for football, Coach Salmons saw how Milo did in the tryouts and thought he did great, despite Jocktopuses complaints. So he made Milo water boy and said that being water boy is his destiny. Milo later got back to the field and notices the game is in the gecko tank, which is really hot. Milo then saves Coach Salmons with water and won the game. After the team cheers for Milo, he owes his fame to Coach Salmons and dumps the whole bucket of water on him. In Dances with Wolf Fish, it is shown he has a exersizing chair.\n\n====Mr.Mussels====\nMr. Mussels(voiced by Tiny Lister) is the drama teacher and a mussel who deeply cares for his students,[3] and wants to motivate and nurture them, despite yeling his messages like a drill sergeant. His dream is for everyone else to have a dream. He gave Bea the part for her amazing entrance with fish flakes falling down, making it look like confetti and said she stole the show. He speaks in a megaphone to make his voice extra-loud. He scared Albert when he didn't get the part.\n\n====Headphone Joe====\nHeadphone Joe(voiced by John Caparulo)is Freshwater High School's janitor that wears a pair of headphones constantly and is never seen without them. He is generally cool and laid back and tries to help the students when they have problems, although he never seems to be of much help in the long run. He is mostly seen cleaning the tanks to make them clean. His first appearance is in the pilot episode when Bea had to wait until Clamantha gets out of the yearbook office, he said that she's never coming out of that room. This gave Bea doubt but it is likely he didn't mean to do it, since his eyes were closed. He then had a brief cameo in Doris Flores Gorgeous, where he was holding the ladder when they had to get Milo's head out of the pipe. He gave Milo advice when he told him that the football game is in the gecko tank, which is VERY hot. He is seen sucking tanks in Bea Becomes an Adult Fish, and Funny Fish.\n\n\n====Koi====\nKoi(voiced by Rachel Dratch) is the biggest fish in Freshwater High, bigger than Jocktopus even. She may appear big and scary, but she hs a lot of heart. Koi is also quite of a jokester, as she makes jokes, which makes her friends say \"Oh, Koi!\" and laughs. She was invited to Bea's sleepover party. When Milo and Oscar sneaked to thier party, Koi seemed to be the most visaubly angriest. So she picked Milo and Oscar up and tortured them. In Fail Fish, Koi and the girls tried to help Milo study, by making a plat, that has to do with the first Fishgiving. Koi makes grunting noises and doesn't talk much either. She is friends with Bea and Shellsea along with thier circle of friends. Like Jocktopus, Koi is one of the strongest in the school. When the board said the dance was \"tommorow\", Koi ripped it off to say \"today\". Koi, and Bea's other friends could communicate with Bea in her laptop, where thay discuss about boys and dating. She is a Koi fish.\n\n\n====Albert Glass====\n\nAlbert Glass(voiced by Atticus Shaffer)is a smart but somehow nervous jellyfish. He is mostly seen being bullied by Jocktopus, and as such is the school nerd. He has a love for the drama club and for that he can somewhat connect with Bea. Albert is in the map club and likes the unfolding part. He usually roams in the halls with his best friend Jumbo Shrimp. Albert tried out for the school auditions, but he didn't get the part and got scared by Mr. Mussels. In Happy Birthfish, Jocktopus, Albert was the first victimn for Jocktopus. When Mr. Baldwin spotted Jocktopus punching ann injured Albert, he made Albert in detention for standing in the hallway too long. When Milo needed to study for his test, Albert and Jumbo tried to help him by doing a stragety game, but Milo has NO idea whats going on. When Oscar wanted to get a new rommate, Albert was the first one and Oscar was about to choose him, until he drank seaweed milk, and since his head is transparent, the milk got in his head visuably\n \n====Principal Stickler====\nPrincipal Stickler(voiced by Jerry Stiller)is a paranoid sea urchin[3] authoritarian who screams out orders to his assistant, Nurse Fishington. He presented Oscar with the popular student award when Oscar tried to be funny. He makes Nurse Fishington do lts of stuff like pushing his chair and various other stuff. When Oscar tried to find a new roommate, Principal Stickler had his biggest part wher he was shown to be a clean freak like Oscar. He and Oscar was doing great at first, but it later got messed up when Oscar and Stickler watched T.V and Stickler didn't like the show Oscar liked, so he told Oscar to throw him. He did, but he smashed the T.V.Then when Principal Stickler vaccumed, he started vaccuming off Oscar's braces, and blew on his eye. Then when Milo came, the wolf fish started to attack Stickler, so he used his vac\n\n====Jumbo shrimp====\nJumbo Shrimp(voiced by TBA)is, according to the name is a big shrimp with an orange waist bag that has many brief cameoes in most episodes. He has two front teeth and his eyes are far apart. Jumbo keeps interesting stuff in his orange pouch. Like his best friend Albert Glass, Jumbo is the school nerd. Jumbo enjoys learning, reading, doing math, science, and like Albert, learns, learns, and learns. In Fail Fish when Milo neede to pass his test, Jumbo and Albert tried to help by doing a medevil stragety game, but didn't succeed. Jumbo's name is briefly seen in the yearbook in the end of Bea Stays in the Picture. Since he never talked so far in the series and the fact that all of his appearances are non-speaking cameoes, not much is known about him.\n\n====Piranhica====\nPiranhica(voiced by Laura Ortiz) is manipulative, intimidating and almost as mean as her boyfriend Jocktopus. She is a piranha[3] , naturally, she likes to manipulate and intimidate the other students of Freshwater High to do her biding, and at some points that includes Jocktopus, even though he's too dumb to realize it, but she is head over fins in love with him. She really hates nerds (Albert and Jumbo) and annoying people. In Happy Birthfish, Jocktopus, Pirahnica helped Jocktopus with his presents and collects the worthless paper (money). She says that \"Jocktopus can smell fear\". Towards the end of the episode, Pirahnica sees Jocktopus punching himself and says he embarrasses her, but then calls him a big dreamy hunk. Unlike Jocktopuses football lackeys, Pirahnica is quite intelligent compared to other students. In the school dance, she danced with Jocktopus. She could have a strong dislike with Milo, Oscar, and Bea. She is the other antagonist of the show\n\n\n====Recurring Chrachters====\n\n====Finberly====\nFinberley(voiced by Kimberley Mooney)is the fish who has pigtails and braces. She is in Bea's close circle of friends, with that said she was invited to her slumber party and tortured Milo and Oscar for sneaking into thier party. She brought cupcakes to the party. In Doris Flores Gorgeous she went on a lunch date with Milo. She is a fan of football, as shown in Underwater Boy. Ever since Doris Flores Gorgeous, Finberley started to have feelings for Milo, like going on a lunch date with him and shyly asking for his autograph, with Milo's responce that he's honored to. She is mostly seen either with Koi or Esmargot. Finberley likes hanging out with Bea, as they communicate in Bea's laptop. Finberley also helped Bea when Bea tried to become the queen of the dance.\n\n====Esmargot====\nEsmargot(voiced by Rachel Dratch) Esmargot is one of Bea's friends, she is a slimy sea slug who leaves off green slime. She talks in a slow, laid-back voice. Esmargot also dated Albert Glass the first, one of the smartest boys. Esmargot was invited to Bea's sleepover party. Esmargot tortured Milo and Oscar when they sneaked to thier party. Out of the girls, Esmargot is the most least seen in the series. In Bea Becomes an Adult Fish, when Bea became an adult, Esmargot said she doing something we all dreamed of doing, but never did. In Fail Fish, Esmargot was part of the play to help Milo study. She played as the sick and hungry pilgrams. When Finberley felt sorry that Esmargot was sick, she acually was\n\n====Mrs.Goldfishberg====\nMrs. Goldfishberg(voiced by Edie McClurg)is the mother of Bea Goldfishberg and the wife of Mr. Goldfishberg.She treats Bea like a baby, but is friendly and kind hearted. She embarrasses Bea a lot throughout the series. She first had a silent cameo in Fish Sleepover Party, where she gave Koi dip so she could overfeed Milo and Oscar. Even though she had a cameo in that episode, she was still credited. In Bea Becomes an Adult Fish, it is shown that she treats Bea like a baby as she makes her cookies and reads her bedtime stories like \"The Tale of Fishbits\" and \"Baby Makes a Piddle\". Bea thinks nothing can be more annoying than her parents, as shown in Queen Bea. She and Bea's dad chaperoned for the school dance. They later figured it was a retirement home.\n\n=====Mr.Goldfishberg====\nMr. Goldfishberg(voiced by Noah Z. Jones) is the father of Bea Goldfishberg. Like the mother, he is friendly, but tends to embarrass Bea a lot. He first appeared at the end of Bea Becomes an Adult Fish. He bought Fish Flake pie, which is the moms favorite, but they \"ate\" it like adults, in which Bea said that thats disguisting. Then he appeared in Queen Bea. He chaperoned for the school dance. He fell for the fake school dance. After Oscar called Bea to dance with the dad, he danced with Oscar. The parents found out that it was a retirement home later. Bea then said she didn't have fake fun with them, so she gives the crown to her parents. He is voiced by the series creator, Noah Z. Jones.\n\n====Dan and Ann Chovie====\nDan and Ann Chovie(voiced by Jane Carr) are twin anchovies that attend Freshwater High and they admire Jocktopus. They are somewhat intelligent students and have a lot of school spirit.\n\n====Pass, Punt, and Fumble====\n\nPass, Punt, and Fumble are Jocktopuses henchmens, along with Pirahnica.They are in the football team.

The choices are case sensitive (\"adult\" is not the same as \"Adult\") and the selection is also used to add the page to the appropriate category.<br>\nKid: light orange<br> Teen: orange<br> Adult: red<br> Senior: maroon<br> Animal: dark brown<br> Robot: light grey<br> Alien: forest green<br> Monster: purple\n\nThe color also sets the category for the character. For example, '''color=Kid''' creates '''Category:Kids'''. (The user version of this Infobox, [[:Template:Infobox user character]], will not auto-create this category.)\n|- valign=top\n| name\n| Name to display at the top of the Infobox. <span style=\"color:mediumblue\"><tt><nowiki>{{PAGENAME}}<\/nowiki><\/tt><\/span> should be used in most situations in case the page has to be moved to a new name.\n|- valign=top\n| image\n| The name of the picture to be displayed, without the brackets or the \"File:\" prefix. Size is fixed at 200px, so images in a 4:3 aspect ratio are preferred over widescreen images.<br>\nExample: &nbsp; <span style=\"color:mediumblue\"><tt><nowiki>Bea Goldfishberg.png<\/nowiki><\/tt><\/span><br> instead of: <span style=\"color:mediumblue\"><tt><nowiki>[[File:Bea Goldfishberg.png]]<\/nowiki><\/tt><\/span> <br>\nIf the picture is not specified, it will use '''No Screenshot 2.png''' as a default.\n\n'''User infobox:''' The full file command should be used (that is <span style=\"color:mediumblue\"><tt><nowiki>[[File:Bea Goldfishberg.png|200px]]<\/nowiki><\/tt><\/span> instead of <span style=\"color:mediumblue\"><tt><nowiki>Bea Goldfishberg.png<\/nowiki><\/tt><\/span>) and should be set to a maximum of 200px size. This will allow for \"hotlinking\" to external sites by specifying the full URL (<span style=\"color:mediumblue\"><tt><nowiki>http:\/\/www.site.com\/picture.jpg<\/nowiki><\/tt><\/span>). Keep in mind that hotlinked pictures will display at full size. If you need to display it at a smaller size, upload it to the wiki and include in the summary that it is going to be used on your User page.\n|-\n| caption {{Diamond}}\n| Caption for the picture.\n|- valign=top\n| gender {{Diamond}} \n| The gender of the character.\n|- valign=top\n| age {{Diamond}} \n| The age of the character. For most characters, this should be left blank or listed as \"Unknown\" since the age of only a few characters have been seen in any of the episodes.\n|- valign=top\n| height {{Diamond}} \n| The height of the character.\n|- valign=top\n| nationality {{Diamond}} \n| The country the character was born in.\n|- valign=top\n| hometown {{Diamond}} \n| The city or village the character was born in.\n|- valign=top\n| born {{Diamond}} \n| The date the character was born on. Like the age parameter, this field should be left blank or listed as \"Unknown\" unless specifically stated in an episode.\n|- valign=top\n| created {{Diamond}} \n| The date the robot was created on.\n|- valign=top\n| nemesis {{Diamond}} \n| Any known nemeses of the characters. Typically, each character only has one nemesis.\n|- valign=top\n| band\n| The name of the band the character belongs to.<br>\n(''\"Position in (band)\" will only be displayed if the '''pband''' parameter is used.'')\n|- valign=top\n| pband {{Diamond}} {{Club}}\n| The position in the band the character occupies (lead singer, drummer, etc.)\n|- valign=top\n| profession {{Diamond}} {{Club}}\n| The profession or job the character has.\n|- valign=top\n| major {{Diamond}} {{Club}}\n| The character's major field of study.\n|- valign=top\n| affiliations {{Diamond}} {{Club}}\n| The group(s) the character belongs to.\n|- valign=top\n| signature {{Diamond}} {{Club}}\n| If the character's signature has been shown in an episode, include a picture of it here. Do not include the brackets or the \"File:\" prefix. Size is fixed at 150px.<br>\nExample: <span style=\"color:mediumblue\"><tt><nowiki>Milo's signature.png<\/nowiki><\/tt><\/span><br> instead of: <span style=\"color:mediumblue\"><tt><nowiki>[[File:Milo's signature.png]]<\/nowiki><\/tt><\/span> \n|- valign=top\n| parents {{Diamond}}\n| One or both of the character's parents if known.\n|- valign=top\n| creator {{Diamond}}\n| The character's creator, if the character is a robot or monster.\n|- valign=top\n| stepparents {{Diamond}}\n| The adoptive parent(s) of the character.\n|- valign=top\n| siblings {{Diamond}}\n| Any known brothers or sisters.\n|- valign=top\n| stepsiblings {{Diamond}}\n| Stepbrothers or stepsisters.\n|- valign=top\n| grandparents {{Diamond}}\n| The grandparent(s) of the character.\n|- valign=top\n| spouses {{Diamond}}\n| Any known current or former spouses of the character.\n|- valign=top\n| children {{Diamond}}\n| The children of the character. Can include stepchildren as long as that is noted.\n|- valign=top\n| friends {{Diamond}}\n| Any known friend(s) of the character.\n|- valign=top\n| loveinterests {{Diamond}}\n| People that the character is dating or romantically involved with.\n|- valign=top\n| pets {{Diamond}}\n| Pets owned by the character.\n|- valign=top\n| title1, title2, title3, title4 {{Diamond}}\n| rowspan=2 | Custom fields that can be used to make categories not included above, such as \"nieces\", \"cousins\" or \"rivals\". Use the \"title\" to define the name of that category, and the matching \"other\" for the information in that category. Example:<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style=\"color:mediumblue\"><tt>title1 = Assistant<\/tt><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style=\"color:mediumblue\"><tt><nowiki>other1 = [[Nurse Fishington]]<\/nowiki><\/tt><\/span>\n|- valign=top\n| other1, other2, other3, other4 {{Diamond}}\n|- valign=top\n| first\n| The first appearance of the character. In most cases this will be the first time they are seen on screen. If they are mentioned prior to their first on-screen appearance or have a speaking cameo where they are not seen, this should be noted in the \"Appearances\" section of the character's page.\n|- valign=top\n| voice {{Diamond}}\n| The actor that provided the voice for the character.\n|- valign=top\n| image2, image3 {{Diamond}}\n| rowspan=2 | Optional pictures and captions that may be included, such as a picture of the voice actor, or an addition picture of the character such as Pamela Hamster's star on the Hamsterwood Walk of Fame.<br>\nSame format as the \"image\" parameter above.\n|- valign=top\n| caption2, caption3 {{Diamond}}\n|}\n\n{{Spacer}}\nValues marked with {{Diamond}} will not be displayed in the Infobox if they are empty or if that line is missing.\n\nValues marked with {{Club}} indicate that at least one must be used in order for the section divider that it is in to be displayed.\n\nWhenever it is necessary to specify more than one item, use the line breaks as follows:<br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style=\"color:mediumblue\"><tt><nowiki>[[page 1]]<br> [[page 2]]<\/nowiki><\/tt><\/span><br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; instead of:<br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style=\"color:mediumblue\"><tt><nowiki>[[page 1]]<br><\/nowiki><\/tt><\/span><br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style=\"color:mediumblue\"><tt><nowiki>[[page 2]]<\/nowiki><\/tt><\/span>\n\nThe vertical spacing between the items will be different if they are put on separate lines as shown above. By keeping them on the same line, the vertical spacing will look correct. The explanation for the \"image\" parameter in the table above shows both the extra spacing and the normal spacing.\n\n''(The code for some fields have been split onto separate lines in order to display correctly next to the example Infobox without sideways scrolling. When entering data into the parameters, do not break the code into separate lines.)''\n<noinclude>[[Category:Infobox templates|{{PAGENAME}}]]\n[[Category:Template documentation|{{PAGENAME}}]]<\/noinclude>","timestamp":"20110115160457","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Gag_Guide","comment":"Created page with 'Gags in \"[[Fish Hooks]]\". ==[[Bud's Pets sign gag]]== The sign outside of [[Bud's Pets]] changes in every episode. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

Coach Salmons tries to get the students to move their fins by getting them to participate in a jumping challenge. You have to choose which character to jump from planks of wood to reach the top.

Blown in insulation will result in more affordable hvac costs having your own home further environment friendly and cozy per year. Starting an cellulose insulation machine will not be too difficult and is an item you're able to do by using a couple of pals. Demonstrated here is a great resource guide that will teach you how to set up and employ an blown in insulation equipment..\n\nBefore you begin using a fiberglass insulation machine, you must set up the wall surfaces where insulation will be used. Thus, employ a stud locater to get the various studs within the design you'll be sealing with insulating material. After that, utilize a pen to mark the location with the studs around half a foot lower out from the ceiling. Studs are normally set to standard widths, so the marks needs to be reliable.\nEmploy a hole drilling adapter as well as your drill that will drill openings among the marks you have made on the stud regions. Go with a holesaw adapter that's around one and one half ins across. Each cavity that may include insulation put in needs a hole.\nTwo folks must set up a insulation machine outdoors. Insulation machines develop a great deal of dust, so start using inside the building is not suggested. After setting up the machine outdoors, bring the insulation fiberglass blowing hose by using an opening such as a door or window.\nIt is better to have a single person packing your machine whilst another blows in the insulation. In all insulation blowing models, you simply need to open the top of the unit as well as drop the content in the container.\nPlace a insulation insulation blowing hose in the very first hole and then cover a cloth or a hand towel round the away from the insulation blowing insulation hose to maintain the insulating material from coming out of the hole. Have each of your associates switch on the device and initiate forcing insulating material throughout the studs inside wall. Blow in insulation until the machine starts to struggle.. Once you feel resistance from the, this means that the area is full of insulation.\nAfter the stud cavities are filled the many spaces with insulating material, you can begin filling the holes. Shove the insulating material in to the wall, then employ a spray foam product or possibly caulking that will fill the opening in.\nFollowing the expanding foam product has dried up, employ a bread knife that will saw it away evenly with all the structure. Complete the wall area with drywall material and other style of putty. Last but not least, complete it using related color.\n\nArticle sources:\n\n*[http:\/\/wiki.thevilleregulars.org\/index.php?title=MastersonMcclintock spray foam insulation machine]\n\n*[http:\/\/adygewiki.org\/w\/index.php?title=CatronMunos fiberglass insulation machine]\n\n*[http:\/\/wikirejects.org\/index.php?title=NertySpriggs Cool Machines]\n\n*[http:\/\/en.internetforparents.org\/index.php?title=O'connellPhipps Truck Mount Insulation Machine]\n\n*[http:\/\/wiki.geeknic.org\/index.php?title=PenaShubert Truck Insulation Machine]\n\n*[http:\/\/bestiarioresearch.org\/wiki-workshopMay\/index.php?title=RobitailleCasarez Gas Insulation Machine]","timestamp":"20120526205741","user-timestamp":"20100927154120","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"1","title":"Main_Page","comment":"Mega thanks for a tolerable resource.","content":"Tender thanks you entirely much for the help forum.

The three friends experience the typical challenges and triumphs as well as fish drama and fish cliques of their freshman year at Freshwater High. If their tween years weren't lively enough, the trio uses special land suit apparatuses (fish-sized backpacks filled with water) to literally become fish out of water on their adventures to the untamed frontier of the pet shop, a strange, surreal and occasionally cartoony-dangerous place where they encounter giant lobster attacks and Wilford, the enormous cat who roams the store, among other surprises. If they stick together, Milo, Bea and Oscar can get through nearly anything with their fins intact.\n; Episodes\n:\"[[Bea Stays in the Picture]]\"\/\"[[Fish Out of Water]]\"\n:\"[[Fish Sleepover Party]]\"\/\"[[Happy Birthfish, Jocktopus]]\"\n:\"[[Doris Flores Gorgeous]]\"\/\"[[Underwater Boy]]\"\n:\"[[Bea Becomes an Adult Fish]]\"\/\"[[Doggonit]]\"\n:\"[[Fail Fish]]\"\/\"[[Funny Fish]]\"\n:\"[[Queen Bea]]\"\/\"[[Baldwin the Super Fish]]\"\n:\"[[Milo Gets a Ninja]]\"\/\"[[Dances with Wolf Fish]]\"\n:\"[[Hooray for Hamsterwood]]\"\/\"[[The Tale of Sir Oscar Fish]]\"\n:\"[[Fishing for Compliments: The Albert Glass Story|Fishing for Compliments]]\"\/\"[[Dropsy!]]\"\n:\"[[The Dark Side of the Fish]]\"\/\"[[Big Fish]]\"\n:\"[[Fish Floaters]]\"\/\"[[Dollars and Fish]]\"\n===Vol. 2===\n===Vol. 3===\n[[Category:Fish Hooks]]","timestamp":"20120606102912","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"ITunes_Vol_2.jpg","comment":"[[Category:Fish Hooks]]","content":"[[Category:Fish Hooks]]","timestamp":"20120606110524","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"200","title":"Will_k","comment":"Created page with \"{{s:User:Will k}}\"","content":"{{s:User:Will k}}","timestamp":"20120606110813","user-timestamp":"20101216140923","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Busy_Bea:_Rise_of_Machines","comment":"Phinbart moved page [[Busy Bea: Rise of Machines]] to [[Busy Bea: Rise of the Machines]]: Correct title.","content":"#REDIRECT [[Busy Bea: Rise of the Machines]]","timestamp":"20120606111030","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Busy_Bea_Rise_of_the_Machines_title_card.png","comment":"[[Category:Title cards]]","content":"[[Category:Title cards]]","timestamp":"20120606111456","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"1","title":"ITunes","comment":"Created page with \"{{Talkheader}}\"","content":"{{Talkheader}}","timestamp":"20120606114906","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Shred_&_Co.","comment":"Created page with \"{{title|Shred & Co.}} '''Shred & Co.''' is a company that produces shredders.

The first block of new episodes premiered on November 6 with \"Fish Out of Water\". During the first block, a boxset of episodes was released on Sky Anytime. One of the episodes was \"Underwater Boy\", which at the time of the boxset release, had not premiered on Disney Channel. Over the Christmas period, there was no new episodes until January 8, 2011. Block 1 ended on January 29, 2011 with \"Baldwin the Super Fish\". During this block, new episodes ran on Saturdays only.\n===Block 2 (\"[[Tank Fish It's Friday!]]\")===\nJust over a month after Block 1 ended, Block 2 started in the form of weekly Friday new episodes, alongside new episodes of other shows in a promotion named \"Tank Fish It's Friday!\". Every Friday in March 2011, two episodes would air, one airing 55 minutes after the other (excluding March 4) Two days before the block started, episodes \"Milo Gets a Ninja\", \"Dances with Wolf Fish\", \"Hooray for Hamsterwood\" and \"The Tale of Sir Oscar Fish\" were released on a boxset on Sky Anytime. The first two episodes in the block, \"Milo Gets a Ninja\" and \"Dances with Wolf Fish\" aired in widescreen. Before the channel broadcast in widescreen later that year in the fall, only movies would air in the widescreen format. However, these two episodes had been sent to international networks in the same way - in widescreen. Every Disney Channel in the world who had not changed to widescreen would broadcast this episode in widescreen.\n===Block 3===\nAlmost three months after Block 2 ended, Block 3 started on June 11, 2011. This time, new episodes would air on Saturdays and Sundays. The episode \"Pamela Hamster Returns\" was accidentally scheduled on the same day as \"Parasite Fright\" was due to premiere. It aired late in the afternoon as \"NEW\". The date which the episode should have premiered, July 9, it aired as \"PREMIERE\". \"Good Morning, Freshwater\" aired on July 10, 8 days after the US premiere. Block 3 finished on July 17, 2011.\n===Block 4===\nNearly two months after Block 3 finished, Block 4 started. Disney Channel had switched to the new logo and the widescreen format on September 1, making the premiere of \"We've Got Fish Spirit\" on September 9 be the first time Disney Channel would broadcast a ''Fish Hooks'' premiere in proper widescreen. Only 4 episodes would air during Block 4, three would air in HD; Disney Channel switched to HD on September 15. On September 16, \"Fish School Musical\" aired, one week before its United States premiere. There was no premiere on September 23; Block 3 finished on September 30 with two new episodes.\n===Block 5===\nIn November 2011, Block 5 started. It began on November 5 with \"Milo on the Lam\", which did not premiere in the United States until 2 months and 1 day later. It had premiered in October in Canada. It ended on November 28 with \"Adventures in Fish-Sitting\".\n===Block 6===\nBlock 6 began in March 2012, the first block of 2012. The new episodes aired at 7:45am, the earliest time new ''Fish Hooks'' have aired in the UK.

But it is a transition fraught with difficulties.\n\nAung San Suu Kyi will feel that the risk she took in deciding to participate in the elections has been vindicated by the scale of her party's success.\n\nBut the real test will be to see how effective she is able to be as an agent for change within parliament.\n\n    Harvey: What now after poll landslide?\n\nAdministration officials said agriculture, tourism, telecommunications and banking would be among the economic sectors to be considered for the relaxation of sanctions.\n\nMrs Clinton said that sanctions would remain in place \"on individuals and institutions that remain on the wrong side of these historic reform efforts\".\n\nThe US eased some sanctions on Burma in February.\nPolitical prisoners\n\nThe US move came hours after Asian leaders meeting for a regional summit issued a formal call for sanctions against Burma to be lifted immediately to help the country's political and economic development.\n\nSpeaking in London, British Foreign Secretary William Hague said EU members would probably be willing to lift some of their sanctions on Burma.\n\n\"That does not mean an instant and complete opening up of trade with Burma,\" he added.\n\nMr Hague said he would keep up pressure on Burma to free political prisoners.\n\nThe Chinese foreign ministry welcomed the Western moves to relax sanctions on Burma, and called for all restrictions to be lifted.","timestamp":"20120724074729","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"ITunes_Vol_3.jpg","comment":"[[Category:Fish Hooks]]","content":"[[Category:Fish Hooks]]","timestamp":"20120724081049","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Catapult_Chaos_Level_6.png","comment":"[[Category:Images from Catapult Chaos]]","content":"[[Category:Images from Catapult Chaos]]","timestamp":"20120724104304","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"14","title":"Images_from_Catapult_Chaos","comment":"Created page with \"Images from [[Catapult Chaos]].\"","content":"Images from [[Catapult Chaos]].","timestamp":"20120724104337","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Catapult_Chaos_Level_7.png","comment":"[[Category:Images from Catapult Chaos]]","content":"[[Category:Images from Catapult Chaos]]","timestamp":"20120724104459","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Catapult_Chaos_Level_8.png","comment":"[[Category:Images from Catapult Chaos]]","content":"[[Category:Images from Catapult Chaos]]","timestamp":"20120724104620","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Catapult_Chaos_Level_9.png","comment":"[[Category:Images from Catapult Chaos]]","content":"[[Category:Images from Catapult Chaos]]","timestamp":"20120724104723","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Catapult_Chaos_Level_10.png","comment":"[[Category:Images from Catapult Chaos]]","content":"[[Category:Images from Catapult Chaos]]","timestamp":"20120724104859","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Untitled_games_episode.png","comment":"","content":"== Licensing ==\n{{fair use}}","timestamp":"20120724164439","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Untitled_games_episode","comment":"Created page with \"{{Upcoming ep}} {{Spoilers}} {{EpPrevNext||}} {{Infobox episode |name=Untitled games episode |image=Untitled games episode.png |caption=<!-- caption for the image --> |season=...\"","content":"{{Upcoming ep}}\n{{Spoilers}}\n{{EpPrevNext||}}\n{{Infobox episode\n|name=Untitled games episode\n|image=Untitled games episode.png\n|caption=<!-- caption for the image -->\n|season=2\n|production=2??<!-- production code for the episode if announced -->\n|broadcast=<!-- episode number in the whole series -->\n|story=\n|writer=\n|storyboards=\n|ws=\n|directed=\n|us=TBA<!-- first airdate for the episode in the US. -->\n|uk=TBA<!-- first airdate for the episode in the UK. -->\n|arc=\n|pairedwith=<!-- episode it aired with -->\n|dvd=\n|badopt=\n|sqbooks=\n}}\n{{quote|Alright, we're doing charades!

What's more, 2012 looks set to be not much different. But as eurozone governments hammer out new rules to limit their borrowing, are they missing the point of the crisis?\n\n    * The eurozone has agreed a new \"fiscal compact\"\n    * Eurozone leaders have agreed to a tough set of rules - insisted on by Germany - that will limit their governments' \"structural\" borrowing (that is, excluding any extra borrowing due to a recession) to just 0.5% of their economies' output each year. It will also limit their total borrowing to 3%. These rules are supposed to stop them accumulating too much debt, and make sure there won't be another financial crisis.\n    * But didn't they already agree to this back in the '90s?\n    * Hang on a minute. They agreed to exactly the same 3% borrowing limit back in 1997, when the euro was being set up. The \"stability and growth pact\" was insisted on by German finance minister Theo Waigel (centre of image). What happened?\n    * So who kept to the rules?\n    * Italy was the worst offender. It regularly broke the 3% annual borrowing limit. But actually Germany - along with Italy - was the first big country to break the 3% rule. After that, France followed. Of the big economies, only Spain kept its nose clean until the 2008 financial crisis; the Madrid government stayed within the 3% limit every year from the euro's creation in 1999 until 2007. Not only that - of the four, Spain's government also has the smallest debts relative to the size of its economy. Greece, by the way, is in a class of its own. It never stuck to the 3% target, but manipulated its borrowing statistics to look good, which allowed it to get into the euro in the first place. Its waywardness was uncovered two years ago.\n    * 3\/9 Italy\n      Worst offender\n    * 5\/9 Germany\n      First to break rules\n    * 6\/9 France\n      Offender\n    * 9\/9 Spain\n      Top of the Class\n    * But the markets have other ideas\n    * So surely Germany, France and Italy should be in trouble with all that reckless borrowing, while Spain should be reaping the rewards of its virtue? Well, no. Actually Germany is the \"safe haven\" - markets have been willing to lend to it at historically low interest rates since the crisis began. Spain on the other hand is seen by markets as almost as risky as Italy. So what gives?\n    * So what really caused the crisis?\n    * There was a big build-up of debts in Spain and Italy before 2008, but it had nothing to do with governments. Instead it was the private sector - companies and mortgage borrowers - who were taking out loans. Interest rates had fallen to unprecedented lows in southern European countries when they joined the euro. And that encouraged a debt-fuelled boom.\n    * Good news for Germany...\n    * All that debt helped finance more and more imports by Spain, Italy and even France. Meanwhile, Germany became an export power-house after the eurozone was set up in 1999, selling far more to the rest of the world (including southern Europeans) than it was buying as imports. That meant Germany was earning a lot of surplus cash on its exports. And guess what - most of that cash ended up being lent to southern Europe.\n    * ...bad news for southern Europe\n    * But debts are only part of the problem in Italy and Spain. During the boom years, wages rose and rose in the south (and in France). But German unions agreed to hold their wages steady. So Italian and Spanish workers now face a huge competitive price disadvantage. Indeed, this loss of competitiveness is the main reason why southern Europeans have been finding it so much harder to export than Germany.\n    * ...and a nasty dilemma\n    * So to recap, government borrowing - which has ballooned since the 2008 global financial crisis - had very little to do with creating the current eurozone crisis in the first place, especially in Spain (Greece's government is the big exception here). So even if governments don't break the borrowing rules this time, that won't necessarily stop a similar crisis from happening all over again.\n\n      Spain and Italy are now facing nasty recessions, because no-one wants to spend. Companies and mortgage borrowers are too busy repaying their debts to spend more. Exports are uncompetitive. And now governments - whose borrowing has exploded since the 2008 financial crisis savaged their economies - have agreed to drastically cut their spending back as well. But...\n    * Cut spending...\n    * ...and you are pretty sure to deepen the recession. That probably means even more unemployment (already over 20% in Spain), which may push wages down to more competitive levels - though history suggests this is very hard to do. Even so, lower wages will just make people's debts even harder to repay, meaning they are likely to cut their own spending even more, or stop repaying their debts. And lower wages may not even lead to a quick rise in exports, if all of your European export markets are in recession too. In any case, you can probably expect more strikes and protests, and more nervousness in financial markets about whether you really will stay in the euro.\n    * Don't cut spending...\n    * ...and you risk a financial collapse. The amount you borrow each year has exploded since 2008 due to economic stagnation and high unemployment. But your economy looks to be chronically uncompetitive within the euro. So markets are liable to lose confidence in you - they may fear your economy is simply too weak to support your ballooning debtload. Meanwhile, other European governments may not have enough money to bail you out, and the European Central Bank says its mandate doesn't allow it to. And if they won't lend to you, why would anyone else?","timestamp":"20120726090548","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Ms._Filet","comment":"Created page with \"'''Ms. Filet''' is set to appear in an upcoming episode, likely to be a teacher at [[Freshwater High]].

Milo checks the trophy out and says that Randy's gonna have to come at him harder, because he's tank-to-tanked the pet store bubble style a 'gazillion' times. Randy says that he has to prove it, and that if he wins, Randy's trophy is his, and if he loses, he pledges his fish loyalty and eternal servitude to him. Milo tells Randy to strap in, as he's about to get Miloed. Milo magics up a bubble and he floats off.

''Fish Hooks'' is a free game for iOS, developed by Graveck, that was released on August 15, 2012 on the New Zealand and Singapore app stores and on August 16, 2012 on the rest of the App Stores. It is compatible with iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, iPod touch (3rd & 4th generations) and iPad. It requires iOS 4.0 or later.\n\nPlayers have to help [[Milo]] and other fish to complete a challenge by helping them reach the exit in just a bubble, while collecting apples along the way.\n\n''Fish Hooks'' is an underwater physics-based adventure puzzle starring Milo the fish and a host of his aquatic friends from Freshwater High. You assume the role of Milo and must master the art of making and popping bubbles to successfully navigate the treacherous waters of Randy's diabolical design. You will have to float, fall and fling yourself through the mazes to advance, all while maneuvering with the precision of a ninja (well, the fish version of a ninja. While you're in a bubble.) Perfect timing and puzzle solving skills are essential if you want to avoid the increasingly difficult obstacles and master all of the underwater moves you'll need to win. Have you got what it takes to BE THE BUBBLE?\n\n<div style=\"float:right; font-size:95%;\">[[Fish Hooks (video game)|Read more]] \u2022 [[Fish Hooks Wiki:Article of the month|All articles of the month]]<\/div>\n<div style=\"float:left; font-size:100%;\">'''Previous articles of the month''': [[Science Fair Detective Mystery]] \u2022 [[Brothers' Day]] \u2022 [[Toothbrush]]<\/div>","timestamp":"20120911172252","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"8","title":"Description","comment":"a brief (~140 characters or so) description of this wiki for search engines, such as Google, Yahoo!, Bing, etc.","content":"Fish Hooks Wiki is a freely editable encyclopedia about the Disney Channel animated cartoon Fish Hooks by Noah Z.

The host was [[Mr. Mussels]], and the judges were [[Ms. Lips]], [[Coach Salmons]] and [[Bassy]]. The winner, Contestant #18 ([[Taylor Brooke]]), a baby, was crowned by [[Brandon Bubbler]].\n==Events and history==\n===Evening Gown Competition===\n[[Bea Goldfishberg]] (Contestant 27) didn't think she did that well in the evening gown competition, as the contestant that went after her got an \"Oooh\", and she didn't.\n===\"Asking Questions\" Competition===\nBea told Mr. Mussels that her biggest wish was to marry Brandon Bubbler, and then said that it was really world peace - both statements getting a low mark from the judges. Bea panicked and said something else that upset Ms. Lips. She ended off swimming off into the dressing rooms crying. \n===Talent Competition===\nBea had put too much makeup on and floated dazed onto the stage. She sat down onto the seat of the piano, and then blacked out, falling onto the keyboard of the piano.\n===Model Competition===\n[[Milo]] told Bea that to win, she had to be cute, which no talent judge could resist. When it was Bea's turn, she came onto the stage holding a giant lollipop and wearing a dress, completing the young child look. Bea then pulled a rope, and the curtains were pulled aside to reveal animals from the pet store behind her, wearing a 'fish-bowl' around their heads so they could breathe. Everyone in the audience started taking pictures, which panicked the three animals. They ran riot around the fish tank, causing everyone to flee. Brandon Bubbler's bodyguards left him, and the duck was about to stand on him before Bea swam upto the duck and managed to hold the duck off with her lollipop. She also managed to corner the animals, making them crash out of the hotel. \n===After the pageant===\nOnce the winner was crowned, Milo apologized for what happened, but Bea's spirits were lifted when she received a letter from Brandon Bubbler thanking her for saving his life. \n==Appearances==\n*{{EpApp|Little Fish Sunshine}}\n[[Category:Events]]","timestamp":"20120916104655","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Deneme14785aaa","comment":"Created page with \"Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme ...\"","content":"Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme Deneme","timestamp":"20120916121947","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Hotel_D'Poisson.png","comment":"[[Category:Images from Little Fish Sunshine]]","content":"== Summary ==\n[[Category:Images from Little Fish Sunshine]]\n== Licensing ==\n{{fair use}}","timestamp":"20120916131653","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"200","title":"Cook879","comment":"import user wiki","content":"There is currently no text in this page.\nYou can [[Special:Search\/ToggleUserPage|search for this page title]] in other pages,\n<span class=\"plainlinks\">[http:\/\/fishhooks.shoutwiki.com\/w\/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Special:ToggleUserPage search the related logs],\nor [http:\/\/fishhooks.shoutwiki.com\/w\/index.php?title=Special:ToggleUserPage&action=edit edit this page]<\/span>.","timestamp":"20120916171624","user-timestamp":"20110123160618","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"2","title":"Cook879","comment":"Created page with \"{{s:User:Cook879}}\"","content":"{{s:User:Cook879}}","timestamp":"20120916171709","user-timestamp":"20110123160618","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"3","title":"Cook879","comment":"Created page with \"{| align=\"center\" style=\"background: #ccf; border: 3px solid #8888AA; width: 100%; -moz-border-radius: 80px;\" |- | Hi.

Because of Westside Barbell's influence, lots of their techniques have turn out to be commonplace in most sports overall performance facilities and hardcore gyms. 1 from the most beneficial of these techniques is actually sled training. Many articles have been written regarding the use of sled training for the recovery and conditioning of athletes. However, one particular with the most overlooked aspects of sled training is it's usefulness in training the each and every morning man or woman.\n\nLet's face it. While coaches, we would like to express that the the greater part of our clients are high level competing sportsmen. There'ersus definitely a great ego cerebrovascular accident there. However, the fact remains, many people in the industry can much more profoundly help the each and every evening individual who would like to improve the top quality of life. There are a lot more \"regular\" people in the world fighting health issues than elite players. Besides, a good coach is determined by how he or she helps someone, not by the flashiness of her or his clientele.\n\nSo without further ranting, let'utes go over sled training for the masses. There are many benefits, some of which go beyond merely recovery and regeneration.\n\nCommon conditioning: Let's face it. People are often just out of form. Even if you carry out get an individual who participates in other physical activities, his or her anaerobic tolerance may perhaps be very low or almost nothing. Because most of our activities and even health measures revolve primarily about anaerobic standards, delivering this particular upward will be absolutely crucial for standard population clientele. Also, there's a lots of research demonstrating that anaerobic training is truly superior to aerobic training for fat loss.\n\nMuscle balance: Besides being out of form, many people also have huge muscle imbalance issues. This is specially true of all the \"non-mirror\" muscles (every one of people on the back of the body). Sled training presents a simple application to address hamstring and glute weakness along with many upper body yanking variations that can help dozens of workplace workers with poor posture.\n\"Functional\" training: I had to slap myself a little for using the term \"functional,\" but sled training really does fit the mould. The sled allows for training in several movement patterns without any great change to the products itself. A single could quickly put into action forward lunging, side stepping, and backward dragging without even changing the load on the sled. This specific would target almost all the muscle tissues in the hip and thighs in the same manner where they will operate in most sporting and every single day activities.\n\nEasy to learn: Often, a coach decides which technique to use based on what Dan David calls \"the idiot factor.\" Some coaches don't use Olympic lifts, kettlebells, or even squatting for this kind of reason. Most times I blame it on negative coaching, but with the standard population, the \"idiot factor\" may just end up being to blame.\n\nPerhaps the customer isn'capital t gifted in movement or maybe he or she focuses poorly on the task at hands. Or maybe the buyer is actually intimidated through the apply or technique being used. Even so, never underestimate the \"idiot factor.\" Having said this, I have yet to see sled training get hit by the \"idiot factor.\" It'ersus quite difficult to do the drills incorrectly, and even if you perform, the potential for damage will be very low. Far more probably the sled just won'n go everywhere. This means your 58-year-previous customer can put it to use just like your sixteen-year-aged athlete.\n\nEasy to implement: It's amazing but the average man or woman who comes in for fitness training is actually much more banged way up than a good elite athlete. Sure, the reasons may become completely different. But I've seen people with a number of surgeries who have barely ever gotten off the couch!\n\nThe problem this kind of causes is apprehension with many movements. The more surgeries and pain people have, the much more hesitant they're to perform strength training. People have to believe in you since a coach before they will will blindly follow your tips. While they will visit you because of your referral or advertising, this kind of doesn'capital t mean that they inherently and fully trust you. Rely on and results develop lifetime customers.\n\nUm, ok, how can this relate to sled training? Sleds are perfect for beginners or those dealing with orthopedic issues because:\n\n* People don'n have any preset ideas about sled training. It isn'big t like using a heavy dumbbell or barbell which can instantly scare the heck out of many.\n\n* Sled training isn't complicated so people can actually start feeling successful early on. This works while an incredible motivator for continued success. Early success in addition expands the customer'utes belief that you just can really help them.\n\n* Sled training doesn'n have the eccentric action that lots of other movements typically possess, which may be helpful for individuals who are dealing with pain situations.\n\n* Sleds could be used by people who have customarily had issues with squatting, lunging, strong knee bending, or back issues. A lot of abdominal muscles fundamental taking movements don'big t aggravate this sort of conditions and allow the customer being fitter, stronger, and improve to the ability where you can start implementing other movements.\n\nLastly, sleds are phenomenal for group training. The industry appears to be leaning toward a lot more team, boot camp, and small group training. Sleds are perfect for everyone fascinated in acquiring involved in more group-based configurations. They could be used since a certain training station, for team challenges, or for most unique\/efficient training methods.\n\nI wish I acquired a proportion off sled sales for writing this kind of article (five percent would always be nice), but my hope is truly that coaches will expand the truly great operate they carry out beyond their elite sports athletes. We're most sportsmen in 1 form or another because life will be a very dynamic sport. While this sort of, we need to train everyone to deal with the demands of the sport. Sleds are actually 1 of the perfect tools to help a coach and consumer reach their goals.\n\nJosh Henkin is the seller of Innovative Fitness Solutions in Phoenix, Arizona.

It was made by Jeff Kinney, the author of the ''{{w2|Diary of a Wimpy Kid (series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid}}'' book series. The site is aimed at children ages 6 to 15 and players can go to different islands, compete in multi-player games, and communicate with each other. Poptropica was officially launched September 2007, and has grown to have over 500 million registered users.\n\nLeading up to the premiere of \"[[Bea Stays in the Picture]]\", Poptropica launched an 'advertisement game' in which a player goes into the fish tanks in search of Bea's picture so they can replace it with a different one. In reward for completing the game, the player receives an \"Official Fish Hooks T-shirt\" and an Underwater Effect for them to use. It was probably, like most other 'advertisement games' launched on Poptropica, only available for a 2-week period.\n\n==External links==\n*[http:\/\/poptropica.com\/ The Poptropica website]\n*[http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZJLk7e2-xAc YouTube - Poptropica: Disney Fish Hooks Advertisement]\n{{Games}}\n[[Category:Online games]]","timestamp":"20121126161851","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Poptropica_opening.png","comment":"[[Category:Images from Poptropica]]","content":"== Summary ==\n[[Category:Images from Poptropica]]\n== Licensing ==\n{{fair use}}","timestamp":"20121126163104","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Poptropica_gameplay.png","comment":"[[Category:Images from Poptropica]]","content":"== Summary ==\n[[Category:Images from Poptropica]]\n== Licensing ==\n{{fair use}}","timestamp":"20121126163104","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"1","title":"Poptropica","comment":"Created page with \"{{Talkheader}}\"","content":"{{Talkheader}}","timestamp":"20121126163130","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Kayla_Brookse.png","comment":"[[Category:Images from Little Fish Sunshine]]","content":"== Summary ==\n[[Category:Images from Little Fish Sunshine]]\n== Licensing ==\n{{fair use}}","timestamp":"20121126163646","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Kayla_Brookse","comment":"Created page with \"{{Infobox character | name = Kayla Brookse | image= Kayla Brookse.png | caption= | animal = Fish <!-- type of animal the character is --> | gender = Female | age= 0-2 years ol...\"","content":"{{Infobox character\n| name = Kayla Brookse\n| image= Kayla Brookse.png\n| caption=\n| animal = Fish <!-- type of animal the character is -->\n| gender = Female\n| age= 0-2 years old\n| height=\n| nationality= American\n| hometown=\n| born   =\n| created=\n| nemesis=\n| profession=\n| band =\n| pband=\n| major=\n| affiliations=\n| signature=\n| parents=\n| creator=\n| stepparents=\n| siblings=\n| stepsiblings=\n| grandparents=\n| spouses =\n| children=\n| friends =\n| loveinterests=\n| pets  =\n| title1=\n| other1=\n| title2=\n| other2=\n| title3=\n| other3=\n| title4=\n| other4=\n| first = \"[[Little Fish Sunshine]]\"\n| voice = <!-- The person who voices the character -->\n| image2  =\n| caption2=\n| image3  =\n| caption3=\n}}\n'''Kayla Brookse''' is a baby fish who won the [[Little Fish Sunshine (pageant)|Little Fish Sunshine beauty pageant]].\n==Personal life==\nShe won the Little Fish Sunshine beauty pageant, that was held in the [[Hotel D'Poisson]] hotel.

He shows the students how to complete the course, but Milo and Oscar don't want to do it. Coach Salmons offers Milo and Oscar the chance to go first, but Milo finds a way to get out of it - by pretending to have gotten [[The Ick]], a rare fish disease. Coach Salmons lets them outside to 'ease the ache', and once he's gone, they make their escape. They don't go too far, however, when they are caught by [[Jocktopus]] and his henchmen. Milo and Oscar are about to take part in a game of sardines, when Milo uses the \"Snapping Turtle Action\" technique, from the obstacle course, to help him and Oscar escape. Just as they are about to swim to the Hokey Poke, they swim into [[Bea]], whose [[Girls Griping at the Gym|theater production]] needs two understudies because [[Koi]] and [[Finberley]], who were supposed to play the lead parts, have just come down with [[The Ick]]. Oscar agrees to it immediately, and so does Milo, eventually. But, Oscar and Milo end up doing push-ups, so they take off their costumes and swim out. They see Coach Salmons in the hallway, so to avoid him, they take a shortcut out of the tank - going up a flag pole. At the bottom, is Jocktopus, who has finally caught up with them. Milo and Oscar fall to the ground and swim away from Jocktopus as fast as they can. Jocktopus chases them into the gym hall, where, in trying to escape, Milo and Oscar complete the obstacle course. Coach Salmons says they performed the fastest lap ever, and in reward they get a prize - which to Milo and Oscar's disappointment is the enrollment in the [[Inter-Aquarium Championships]], full of much harder obstacle courses and drills.\n\n==Credits==\n*Writer: Roberto Gagnor\n*Pencils and Inks: Federico Mancuso and Elisabetta Melaranci\n*Colors: Dario Calabria\n*Letters: Litomilano S.r.l.\n[[Category:Comics]]","timestamp":"20121228114117","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Hokey_Poke","comment":"Redirected page to [[Hokey Poke Diner]]","content":"#REDIRECT [[Hokey Poke Diner]]","timestamp":"20121228114137","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"14","title":"Comics","comment":"Created page with \"Comics.\"","content":"Comics.","timestamp":"20121228115107","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"10","title":"Italic_title","comment":"Created page with \"''{{PAGENAME}}'' <noinclude>[[Category:Templates]]<\/noinclude>\"","content":"''{{PAGENAME}}''\n<noinclude>[[Category:Templates]]<\/noinclude>","timestamp":"20121228150112","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Infobox_comic\/Appearances","comment":"Redirected page to [[Template:Infobox comic]]","content":"#REDIRECT [[Template:Infobox comic]]","timestamp":"20121228183739","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Gym_Class_Getaway\/Appearances","comment":"Created page with \"<center>[[Gym Class Getaway|Back to ''Gym Class Getaway''.]]<\/center> :''In order of appearance'': ==Characters== <gallery> File:blank.png|\"Snapping\" Turtle File:Coach Salmons...\"","content":"<center>[[Gym Class Getaway|Back to ''Gym Class Getaway''.]]<\/center>\n:''In order of appearance'':\n==Characters==\n<gallery>\nFile:blank.png|\"Snapping\" Turtle\nFile:Coach Salmons.JPEG|Coach Salmons\nFile:Steve Jackson.png|Steve Jackson\nFile:Albert Glass.JPEG|Albert Glass\nFile:Jumbo Shrimp.JPEG|Jumbo Shrimp\nFile:Milo praising Oscar's video game chair.PNG|Milo\nFile:Oscar looking at Jocktopus.JPEG|Oscar\nFile:Esmargot.png|Esmargot (flashback)\nFile:Finberley with cupcakes.png|Finberley (flashback; mentioned)\nFile:Shellsea.JPEG|Shellsea\nFile:Pass, Punt and Fumble.png|[[Fumble]]\nFile:Pass, Punt and Fumble.png|[[Punt]]\nFile:Pass, Punt and Fumble.png|[[Pass]]\nFile:Jocktopus with nerd fish balloons.png|Jocktopus Vandenbush\nFile:Bea Goldfishberg, actress superstar!.JPEG|Bea Goldfishberg\nFile:Koi.png|Koi (mentioned)\nFile:Mr. Baldwin telling Milo that he's late again.PNG|[[Mr. Baldwin]]\nFile:Clamantha.png|[[Clamantha]]\n<\/gallery>\n==Locations==\n<gallery>\nFile:Freshwater High.PNG|[[Freshwater High]]\nFile:Hokey Poke Diner.JPEG|Hokey Poke Diner (mentioned)\n<\/gallery>\n==Other==\n<gallery>\nFile:blank.png|The Fighting Fish\nFile:blank.png|The Ick (mentioned)\nFile:blank.png|''Girls Griping at the Gym''\nFile:blank.png|Inter-Aquarium Championships (mentioned)\n<\/gallery>\n[[Category:Appearances]]","timestamp":"20121228184024","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"6","title":"Uncomfortably_Personal_Questions.png","comment":"[[Category:Images from Koi Story]]","content":"== Summary ==\n[[Category:Images from Koi Story]]\n== Licensing ==\n{{fair use}}","timestamp":"20121231113005","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Uncomfortably_Personal_Questions","comment":"Created page with \"[[File:Uncomfortably Personal Questions.png|200px|right]] '''Uncomfortably Personal Questions''' is a board game that [[Bea]] and her friends played at a sleepover.

Unfortunately, [[Principal Stickler]] and [[Nurse Fishington]] were nearby and Stickler asked Milo what they were talking about; he thought they were talking about bears in the nude. Milo told Stickler how he found a hair in the food, which prompted him to fire Latoada. She became upset, and Milo, feeling guilty, helped her find another job. Milo, Bea and Oscar realized that all Latoada wanted to do was to be a lunchlady, and so the gang took Latoada, in disguise, to the Lunchlady Tryouts at the school. Latoada presented her dish, grey mush, which prompted Sticker to re-hire her because he enjoyed the dish when he attended the school. Latoada came out of disguise too quickly and because of this, Stickler fired her again. After Milo told Stickler that it was Oscar's hair in the food, Latoada was re-hired and Oscar was fired, despite not having a job. As punishment, Milo was ordered to peel a excessive amount of onions.

Maternity is  connected to take its toll in a bitch. But sometimes it  ends up being  quite challenging to  consider theanimal  actions and it takes a  great deal oftime to understand and make out if the  canine is pregnant.  Allow us go ahead and see thesymptoms of the early  maternity in  pets.<br>Consuming habits-A  terrific Sign<br>In fact it is a  misunderstanding that  prior to the  very early indicators of  maternity dogs  often consume  a lot more thantheir  normal appetite is. They  likewise  consume  as well less than  just whatthey  often  utilize to consume.  Any type of  abnormality in the diet plan of the dog is a clear indicator of early  maternity.  However at thesame time it is  extremely important to keep in mind that if the  pets eats very  much less or does not eat  whatsoever, it may be for a reason which is not  associated to  maternity. Hence a  complete checking will be needed.<br>Behavior patterns<br>If you  do not have  viewing the  very same amount of energy that the  canine had  in the past,  possibilities are that the pet dog is pregnant. In pregnancy  just what will happen is that the pet dog will not be as active as it was  in the past. But again here it  is essential to note that thedog  might not be  behaving  in this manner  as a result of  maternity. But one sure shot  indicator here to note is that the  reasons may be something else too. So a thorough check up with the  vet  wouldcertainly be  extremely  suggested at thisjuncture.<br>Changes in the body of a dog<br>Like a  female,  also the bitch's  physical body modifications  will certainly  provide you a pointer of the  maternity of the  pet. The major  adjustment that would  occur here is of the  nipple areas which  would certainlyenlarge. In the initial week or the second, the  nipple areas of the  canine getenlarged and that is a  extremely clear indication. In fact for those dogs that  have actually already  come tobe  mommies prior to this,  will certainly havenipples which are in the hanging position.<br>Existence of relaxin<br>There is a  material called relaxin, which exists in the dog while pregnancy. This is a  sort of  examination determined by the  vet and immediately the dog  ought to be sentfor this test once the earlier signs are visible. It is a material released by  pets prenatal and is  located in theirblood.<br>Listening to the heartbeats of apuppy<br>Within 25 days of pregnancy a veterinarian could hear the heartbeats of the puppy in themother's  tummy. Getting  sensed for this is also  essential. A  veterinarian can  well  find this and ensure that the puppy is alright andis  taking a breath very well. Other wayin which the vets can  really feel the presence of  young puppies in the bitch's  tummy is by  pushing the dog's belly. This  willcertainly also  offer an  indicator that the  pet dog is  expectant and young puppies inside are hale and hearty.<br><br>Consistent belly  monitoring<br>Exact same like a  female, the belly of a pet will slowly and  slowly grow giving an sign that she is  lugging puppies inside.Even a  discuss the  mid-sections of the  pet and the belly the  maternity  could be determined. Obviously  afterwards rendering  clinical  focus is  most definitely important.","timestamp":"20140915233834","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"2","title":"Randi31Koxxp","comment":"create user page","content":"","timestamp":"20140917074407","user-timestamp":"20140917074312","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Los_entusiastas_de_los_juegos_no_creen_de_Destiny","comment":"Created page with \"La Totalidad De el medio piensan que el genero de los juegos de video FPS es un cosmos en el que ya la totalidad de se halla repetido.

Al mismo tiempo, los desarrolladores responsables del game, Bungie, estan bastante perplejos de cara a este indiferente admision y nos aseguran que Destiny no va a ser una copia de los contenidos para consolas del apartado FPS que nosotros hemos hallado hasta ahora y que asi mismo contara con suficiente material desde el dia de su lanzamiento. <br><br>Si Bien inclusive observando que las principales impresiones del videjuego son mas que positivas y han sorprendido a la mayoria de la prensa especialista, parece ser que la comunidad de gamers no acaba de confiar que el videjuego va a observar lo que asegura conseguir, posiblemente por la razon de que ya son una infinidad contenidos que han prometido eso tambien y han desenganado. <br><br>En eso, los disenadores que contabilizan entre sus contenidos para consolas con el celebre Halo, lo sugieren muy claro, los padres de la saga de videojuegos Halo lo tienen seguro. Su nueva obra, el ansiado Destiny, es el game mas grande que han desarrollado hoy por hoy y es por esta motivacion por la que no comprenden los recelos que los devotos de los juegos ensenan frente a la chance de que exista insuficiente contenido jugable. <br><br>De acuerdo a  las manifestaciones de los portavoces de comunicacion de Bungie, Destiny es el juego mas importante creado y el de mas expansion de todos los que han creado los citados estudios, algo que teniendo en mente a contenidos de la altisima calidad de Halo, nos coloca con ganas de experimentar lo que Seguro es una unica obra de arte. De todas maneras, las principales videos que hemos podido encontrarnos no nos pueda dejar aseverar este hecho ya que la informacion hoy en dia resulta mas bien poca y los mismos estudios no dan mucha noticias acerca de Destiny, ni referente a su contenido o hipoteticos temas extra descargables. Sin duda da la impresion de que Destiny puede ser uno de los videogames que mas nos llevan a otorgar que narrar en los siguientes meses, un detalle que podemos iniciar a verificar sencillamente visitando las paginas paginas webs especializadas en juegos.","timestamp":"20140917081404","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Destiny_o_de_que_forma_sacar_un_juego_de_video_de_exito","comment":"Created page with \"  Algunas veces el universo del videojuego nos brinda una obra maestra, un videojuego que sobresale debido a su inmensa adopcion por el publico asi como por el desmesurado muy...\"","content":"\n\nAlgunas veces el universo del videojuego nos brinda una obra maestra, un videojuego que sobresale debido a su inmensa adopcion por el publico asi como por el desmesurado muy posible exito en ventas.

Estas interrogantes plantean una circunstancia a la que puede afanoso buscar solamente una solucion. En realidad, de ningun modo creo que los videojuegos sean malvados o inmejorables, sino que tiende a ser penosa o apropiada la postura con la que los jugadores de videogames se ponen enfrente de un videjuego, y esto va a depender de un monton de elementos, individuales y educativos. <br><br>En otros terminos, resulta ser cierto que una cantidad de videogames de consolas resultan violentos y nos ense\u00f1an una cantidad de principios morales poco queridos a pesar de todo, especialmente en la coyuntura de los devotos de los videojuegos mas jovenes, resulta la compromiso de los tutores el controlar el plena llegada a dichos contenidos para consolas a sus hijos, para que de esta forma dispongan vigilancia en relacion a lo que se ense\u00f1a. \u00bfAlguien piensa que va a experimentar algo mas destreza intelectual por estar jugando repetidamente a un juego? \u00bfO se va a tolerar mas con su unidad familiar por estar jugando unidos una partida de Wii U? \u00bfO va a funcionar como un criminal por competir en videojuegos salvajes?

Pets have many  species and each species has its own time period when it  acquires warmed. But for  any kind of bitch it will not get  warmed for greater than two times a year. However it is crucial to note that the male  petdogs are always  eager to  friend with the females.  Yet  womendogs are  really  wise and donot  permit themselves to be  positioned unlessthey  prepare and wish to.<br>This is a very  special  reality to  learn about that there are  virtually seven to fourteen days of the heating time ofthe  women  pets.

In some cases it  could last long  as much as a week  approximately. The semen  hinges on the vulva of the  women dog. It isnot  needed tat a  lady acquires  expecting instantly.

Asi nos topamos de que esto ha provocado furor en uno pertenecientes a los campos mas significantes del diversion, queremos decir con claridad a los video-games. Asi Lo old school resulta muy a la novedad todo esto resulta un tema cristalino y que tenemos que ver tan solo recorriendo un peque\u00f1o garbeo a traves de las avenidas de una determinada localidad normalita, evaluando  que estilan los jovenzuelos, los adornos tal cual cascos para m\u00fasica, apps para moviles, y como no resulta tratarse de de distinta modo en los juegos de consolas.<br><br>\n\nContinuamente hay gamers todavia mas sagaces que tornan esa necesidad en un comercio, de esta tal guisa somos capaces de admirar que han surgido muchos medios de reproducciones en video que unicamente revelan cada escondidos y cada secretos, siendo el juego lo poco significativo.  Los gamers se han vuelto estrellas de los videos, inclusive gran parte de estos no resultan ser autenticos jugones, sino simplemente buscadores de estos logros que luego suben a sus canales de video.<br><br>Sea como podria ser sea, y a traves de las modernas Xbox One o Ps4 en el sector, hemos visto lo cual el hablado modo de micropagos es mucho mas que una verdad. En este asunto buscamos efectuar alguna micro meditacion\u2026 Hace ya tiempo, antes de que x360 como Ps3 existieran en el mercado internacional, esos jugadores gozaban en muchos videojuegos acceso a una determinada grupo de tips que propinaban superioridad al juego y los cuales muchas ocasiones hacian hacian posible pudiesemos encontrar el fin de videojuegos y sobre todo los mas dificiles.

Cualquier cosa que nos parece ciertamente improcedente \u00bfno piensas igual?<br><br>Con el fin de finalizar, una escueta reflexion. Hace poco los empresarios de las salas de cine dispusieron por un dia descender el costo de  las entradas frente a la exigua asistencia  de la gente a las salas, y como podria ser resultado tuvieron las salas de cine repletas (incluso con cartel de billetes agotadas en diversas salas) consiguiendo mas euros que si hubieran continuado  entradas al precio exagerado al que suelen posicionarse. De Esta Forma que caballeros amos de tiendas especializadas, o responsables de reparto de distintas firmas, si piensan esto, algo que dudo bastante, aprendan de esto.<br><br>En este sentido, las diferentes sistemas de descarga suelen estar a rebosar de videojuegos de plataformas y incluso reviews de videojuegos retros los cuales los mas viejos hemos sido capaces de admirar en las simuladoras de recreo y con los que estabamos las todas las tardes jugando sin detenernos. Si bien al igual que sin duda atras de casi todo esto existe un diverso negocio. De esta forma podemos ver que conocidos famosos artilugios clasicos que en su epoca fuesen muy asequibles se han transformado en una clase de fragmentos de colecionista con los que piden buena cantidad de cuartos, inclusive en que la totalidad de ellos son simples copias confeccionadas en Corea.<br><br>\u00bfNo obstante que ocurre ahora? Somos capaces de declarar lo dicho? Por desgracia de hecho no es de esta forma. Si tu eres competidor de Xbox te daras cuenta que la tendencia es recompensar junto a achivements al gamer sin casi no causar ninguna cosa. Es bastante comun ver contenidos en los que tan solo por superar el inicio, se obtiene un achivement \u00bfresulta ser sinceramente es afanoso atravesar un prologo? Es decir, \u00a1lo tienes que jugar a la fuerza! Y esto es unicamente un patron de la multitud de achivements tontos que se nos permite ver en centenares de juegos.<br><br>Siendo totalmente veraces, este muestra de experiencias han hecho caer la utilidad que en un origen causaban en el gamer, convirtiendose de lo que era un agradecimiento pensada para aquellos jugadores de los mas potentes que jugaban a lo largo de muchas horas para adquirirlos y que hacian que resultaran cosiderados por gurus en el mercado de los juegos de consolas para transformarse en un aspecto que es capaz granjearse quien sea.<br><br>Los logros se han transformado en una alternativa de lo mucho mas intentado por absolutamente todos los gamers y usuarios de Xbox360, una cosa que de ninguna manera resulta extra\u00f1o por que los mismos logros permiten que la vida de en cada de los videogames resulten bastante mas duraderos que si unicamente nos centramos a las variantes de juego normales.

These commercials are the most obnoxious, dull, appalling, creepy, or just basic...bizarre examples of promoting to hit the market place.<br>Every calendar year, it appears like the firm large-wigs have sat all over and had a contest to see who could develop a thing even even worse than the yr right before. Probably they get a more substantial bonus if their advertisement can make you shoot you!<br>If you assumed final year's commercial's ended up awful, sign up for me as I discover some of 2012's most troublesome commercials. The terrible, the ugly, and the downright frightening!<br>The HopperThe \"Hopp-ah\" is some newfangled attribute supplied by Dish Tv set. I am not genuinely positive what it does, since the advert is so bothersome I depart the room or change off the tv. (Which is good for their advertising huh?) All I know is that it has a bunch individuals shouting out \"The Hopper!\" from distinctive rooms of the residence.<br>There are a pair of other commercials about the identical merchandise, which includes just one wherever the same people today shout out \"Soiled Con!\" The effect is just as obnoxious, and has basically built me look at changing cable providers. Way too negative the competition's adverts are just as horrific. <br>Underlying Message: Households! Don't sit in the exact same place! You can now yell from any home in the household! Dang! And I imagined that technologies experienced been accessible given that the cavemen first had youngsters!<br>SwifferSome of their ads usually are not far too negative. I never brain their latest commercials wherever the woman (haha, its often a female, is just not it?) declares that she is \"Performed!\" with her family chores sooner than predicted, and that she is now going to do one thing enjoyable.<br>It IS a minimal troublesome that even though she is carrying out all of this work, in what appears to be like like an already impeccable household, many associates of the family members are lounging about the dwelling--not supporting.<br>Still though, they are a significant improvement in excess of the last established of commercials where people today pretended to be Dust, Mud, Dust, and so on. and fell in \"appreciate\" with the Swiffer solution. Every single with its personal quite corny tagline.<br>Maybe my creativeness is a minor way too active, but I really don't like the imagined of my grime getting alive. If individuals particles of dust and mud are alive, then they are in all probability spying on me. Because this advertisement arrived out, I always stomp on my grime, mud and dust bunnies prior to cleaning, just to make sure.<br>Underlying Message in all Swiffer ads: Mom last but not least has time to choose a tub for the initially time in twelve years now that Swiffer is all-around!<br>IkeaOkay. I have under no circumstances been in an Ikea retail store. It just isn't really my style. And their ads are a little off-placing. I thought the commercials where the husbands and wives \"negotiated\" in excess of household renovations were being rather poor.<br>I could not see considerably change in all the options they confirmed. Just looked like unique arrangements for the very same items. I use that trick all the time to make it search to my husband like I have cleaned residence.<br>Now they have a NEW commercial! This a single displays a Mother putting her son, \"Leo\" in time-out. In the kitchen area. (with a tricycle! Wow, we never had time-outs like that when I was rising up!) Minimal Leo then proceeds to trash the kitchen just after Mom disappears.<br>The underlying information here is: \" Never instruct your child to respect items, just purchase things that will endure the tiny brat.\" Its beautifully okay that he kicks all the doorways and drawers, rams his trike into factors, and harasses the family members doggy with the h2o sprayer, for the reason that this kitchen area is designed to endure toddlers!<br>Maybe Ikea should to offer newborn cages that match the kitchen decor. Or maybe Mom should not leave Leo in time-out for so extended. From the seems of the advert, she vanishes for about two hrs. Loads of time for the small rapscallion to have ruined even an Ikea kitchen area at the fee he was functioning. I guess she applied that time to acquire the tub that Swiffer earned her!<br>Totino's \"We Are Dyyyyiiiiing\"Here we see what Leo from the over ad is probably heading to be like as a younger teenager. In this professional Mom is named on her cellphone although out performing her errands, and her kids swear they are starving.<br>This is wonderful due to the fact they are outdated more than enough to be household alone, but are unable to obtain a box of Totino's pizza rolls sitting down ideal in front of them. Now, if they aren't brilliant plenty of to see the brightly colored box in the normally vacant freezer...are they actually to be trusted cooking these treats in the microwave?<br>On a similar notice, I actually dislike how commercials these kinds of as this a single, Sunny D, Tyson Hen, etc. constantly clearly show Mother out working her ass off, (typically shopping for far more groceries) and all the food stuff becoming eaten up by neighborhood kids, who never hassle to enable her carry the baggage in from the car or truck. They merely run as a result of the kitchen area and ask her to hand her a thing out of the fridge or get it off the counters as they operate as a result of.<br>I consider we are deep enough in the 21st century to depose the Stepford Mom from her job in commercials. Let's see a actual mom telling her little ones that if they are not able to find the pizza rolls, then they aren't hungry ample to try to eat ahead of supper.<br>Skittles--Taste The RainbowTaste The Rainbow. I am under no circumstances absolutely sure what specifically is heading on in these commercials. They are a minor trippy and often depart me experience like I have experienced a dose of Nyquil.<br>I was accomplishing a fairly good task of disregarding them. Right up until they commenced airing the a person exactly where the girl is swapping spit with the enormous...walrus? I have watched each gross-out horror film ever built, and under no circumstances gagged like I did the to start with time I observed this.<br>Any industrial that can make me want to eliminate my lunch is not heading to place me in the mood to run out and get candy. In simple fact, I get a small queasy just seeing a bag of Skittles. Not that I have something in opposition to walruses, its just that this particular one looks a little bit fishy to me. I think he could gain from 1 of those people outrageous Axe Deodorant commercials!<br>Underlying Information: Skittles should incorporate some sort of psychedelic drug that tends to make you do bizarre items. If you are a walrus, it could make you kiss weird women of all ages. Now we know the real reason Skittles vodka drinks have turn out to be so well known at functions!<br>SonicNot all Sonic commercials are frustrating. Just the kinds with the two fellas sitting down in the car or truck. Personally I find these dudes a tad creepy. They are constantly in the motor vehicle outside the house of Sonic, which suggests stalker tendencies. It's possible they are setting a new development in food items stalking.<br>Not only are they creepy, they are losers. These are developed guys with absolutely nothing better to do than sit in a car and perform with their food items, whilst bandying about these types of topics as \" Style Bros\" and \"Funky Fresh new\". Not only does the dialog go away a lot to be ideal, it occasionally wholly forgets to truly market the solution. Thus, it is challenging to pick just just one of these adverts as the extremely worst. They are all fairly substantially equally atrocious.<br>Underlying Concept: Wives, do you truly know your husbands? Are they genuinely performing late? Or are they parked in a car somewhere with one more male obtaining conversations with tater tots?<br>Caveat EmptorHow typically do commercial's influence your purchases?<br>All the time. I like to try what I see on television.<br><br>Sometimes, if the merchandise is something I am already fascinated in.<br><br>Probably just the meals.<br><br>Not generally. I prefer phrase of mouth.<br><br>Never.<br>See outcomes without votingCharminThe cartoony bears, to me, are both aggravating and a tiny vulgar. I believe that that toilet small business belongs in the toilet, and when I was increasing up our mom and dad retained pottying as discreet as feasible. We surely did not have \"inspections\" to see if any bathroom paper particles had adhered to the skin.<br>It seems a bit pervy to me to think that there may be individuals, not just cartoon bears, lingering outdoors of the rest room whilst their youngsters are utilizing the rest room, asking them thoughts about what they are undertaking and how substantially they are working with.<br>In fact, most bathroom paper commercials are a bit weird. We have a person brand exactly where a mom hugs her kid due to the fact of toilet paper. Other individuals exactly where girls are discussing the almost graphic purpose of toilet paper, and of program standing outdoors of toilet doorways like toilet paper police, building certain no one particular employs as well a great deal.<br>And lets not fail to remember that one a couple of several years back the place the mothers and fathers packed Scott rest room paper for the daughter as she still left for university! Due to the fact naturally, her rest room habits were being the prime precedence as she set off to obtain her education and learning. That lousy lady was almost certainly happy to get away from the plan inspections.<br>Underlying Message: Bathroom paper is so very important and so precious that it is use has to be monitored regularly. And it really should be powerful ample to use as a hammock...which will make me speculate what men and women are basically doing with this stuff!<br>Colonial Penn Lifestyle InsuranceLets face it, all insurance policy commercials are a little bit aggravating. Colonial Penn advertisements are, for the greater part, just dull. But there is one that definitely bugs me. It demonstrates two women meeting at a mailbox, and one asks the other how she is holding up since her mom died.<br>The \"grieving\" woman claims, just about also non-chalantly, that it was hard, but she was ok. Then she requires a letter out of the mailbox and happily exclaims \" Wow, that was rapid!\"<br>If you aren't viewing the television at the time, it appears like  card international the other girl claims this, in response to the daughter becoming more than Mom's demise so promptly. In point, it is the daughter herself, delighted to obtain a check from Colonial Penn to go over the funeral fees. She then goes on to commence making an attempt to market her neighbor on how amazing the business is.<br>I'm not certain why this just one bothers me...maybe its the carefree way the woman replies, maybe the in general cheesiness of the professional. One thing just isn't really proper in suburbia.<br>Underlying Concept: As extensive as there is a examine included, its all excellent.<br>McDonald'sI'm not ashamed to acknowledge it. I adore McDonalds. In simple fact, it is a single of my favorite fast food spots. I favored it a lot Much more when it was crimson and yellow and had all the exciting figures. Now that McDonald's is hoping to be a stylish espresso dwelling, it is a little little bit monotonous. I don't like coffee, I like coke, fries, and chicken sandwiches. Oh, and the Hamburglar. I miss that person!<br>That currently being mentioned, the commercials for the McDonald's dollar menu are specifically irritating. And in some cases a tiny sexist. \"Wow, I am intelligent adequate to buy a low-cost hamburger, as a result, it is perfectly all right for me to lie to this woman.\"<br>Underlying Information: If you are sensible enough to buy the most affordable detail on the menu, you may possibly be able to influence a lady that you discuss French. For about...10 seconds.<br>Cars.comYet a different disturbing industrial. This time possible motor vehicle buyers have wee heads that pop out of their other system components, like some thing from Men In Black. Then they sing. What is even scarier? No a single looks to see the alien-like protrusions. The salespeople are just so delighted to be building a sale.<br>Whereas all of these are quite appalling, the just one with the female is the worst. A small model of her deal with pops out of her bouffant hairdo and begins singing a seriously negative pop music about how confidant she is. Is it even legal to market a motor vehicle to a two headed driver? Does the miniature head have to have a license too?<br>Underlying Information: You have a singing second head? Whatever. Hey, as long as there is a verify involved, its all good.<br>Honorable MentionsEven while coverage, drug, and car commercials are all hugely bothersome, I did notice that a lot more and a lot more, it is food stuff ads that genuinely suck .<br>Below are some that the environment could do without having:<br><br>Beggin' Strips--I enjoy you, I love bacon, I like you. I adore bacon. I dislike this canine.<br><br>Progresso Soup--Canned humor.<br><br>Hershey's Air Delights--Oh glimpse. A sweet bar that tastes just like past year's leftover Halloween chocolates! We are intended to be so thrilled they pumped our chocolate comprehensive of air!<br><br>True California Dairy--What can I say? The cow is just...silly.<br><br>Activia--Some men and women take in yogurt simply because they like the flavor. Nonetheless now, getting yogurt is practically the very same as getting Ex-lax. Embarrassing. \" Oh! Glance who's irregular currently!\"<br><br>Fiber 1--All of them. Its wellbeing foods. And it preferences like it.<br><br>Blue Dogfood, and other makes--At the threat of producing a large amount of animal lover's angry, I am heading to place out a reasonable truth. Canine really don't care how quite a few natural fruits and anti-oxidants are in their chow. That is for the owner's advantage. Want to make the pet dog content? Make the kibbles flavor like nearly anything disgusting.<br>A couple of extra random gag-worthy commercials:<br><br>La-Z-Boy--industrial with Brook Shields. \" Shuuuut uuup?\"<br><br>Minor Caesars--Woo, Dachsund.<br><br>Subway-Very little Child voices<br><br>Geico Pig--WHEEEEE! I thought this a person experienced vanished. Just about every time it plays, I want to call Jimmy Dean and convey to them exactly where they can find their future sausage.<br><br>Travel Ads--I know a lot of folks who wrestle to buy groceries some months. But I confident am happy that the person on the industrial was equipped to just take two or a few vacations thanks to low cost hotel rates!<br><br>Vonage--We aaalll bundle. Alright, I get this was intended to be creepy, Mission attained. Back again to Stepford...wherever we all use the same cell phone strategy, all the Mom's use Swiffer's, and Ann is neat that her mom died because she bought the test in time!<br>Final ThoughtsCommercials engage in an significant part in culture, and even even though they are irksome at periods, they nonetheless sell goods. Just not to me! I know I have ignored a number of opportunity winners, these types of as commercials for prescription medications, dating web sites, home-keep cleaners, car advertisements, places to eat, and technological innovation.<br>I'm positive you all have your particular finest of the worst checklist as very well. Remember to really feel no cost to add, subtract, flame and applaud the decisions offered in this article, and notify me your the very least favored commercials.

Daca cautati un cod postal dintr-o localitate anume apasati pe una din localitatile de pe site. In cazul in care orasul cautata nu se afla in lista de localitati folosi motorul de cautare pentru a gasi adresa dorita.\n\nCodurile postale in Romania\nIn tara noastra codurile au fost folosite pentru prima oara in anul 1974, codul postal de la acea data era alcatuit din 4 cifre. Modificarea codurilor postale in Romania s-a efectuat in data de 1 mai anul 2003 cand a intrat in vigoare un nou cod postal numeric format de aceasta data din 6 ciftre,avand scopul de a simplifica siviciul postal.\nIn momentul de fata codificarea postala a devenit foarte detaliata ajungand sa fie atribuite coduri postale pana la cladiri.\n\nSemnificatie coduri postale\nCodurile postale au o semnificatie logica dupa cum urmeaza:\n- prima cifra reprezinta zona postala din romania si este formata din cifre de la 0 la 9, Romania este impartita in zece zone postale in acest moment\n- a doua cifra reprezinta codul judetului componenta a unei regiuni, folosind valori de la 0 la 5. Directia Regionala de Posta din Bucure?ti are o situa?ie speciala: cele sase sectoare ale Bucurestiului, sunt concentrate intr-un judet, au valori stabilite intre 1 si 6, iar cifrele 7 ?i 8 sunt atrbuite judetelor Giurgiu si Ilfov.\n- ultimele patru cifre reprezinta, din punct de vedere postal, resedintele de judet, orasele, satele (cu precizarea comunei), strazile, portiuni de strazi si imobile.\n\nCodurile postale au fost modificate in varianta complexa pentru a elimina confuzia facuta intre localitatile cu nume similare din judete diferite.","timestamp":"20150606190045","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"200","title":"Root123","comment":"import user wiki","content":"","timestamp":"20150609231821","user-timestamp":"20150609231742","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"2","title":"HJUSheldon","comment":"create user page","content":"","timestamp":"20150715174427","user-timestamp":"20150715174424","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"2","title":"TiffaniGlaser","comment":"create user page","content":"","timestamp":"20150718155752","user-timestamp":"20150718155748","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Marvin_Gaye","comment":"Created page with \"{{Upcoming ep}} {{Spoilers}} {{EpPrevNext||}} {{Infobox episode |name={{PAGENAME}} |image=Marvin Gaye.png |caption=[[Chica]] squeaking to [[Marvin Gaye's brother]] |season=2 |...\"","content":"{{Upcoming ep}}\n{{Spoilers}}\n{{EpPrevNext||}}\n{{Infobox episode\n|name={{PAGENAME}}\n|image=Marvin Gaye.png\n|caption=[[Chica]] squeaking to [[Marvin Gaye's brother]]\n|season=2\n|production=222b\n|broadcast=100\n|story=\n|writer=\n|storyboards=\n|ws=[[Skyler Page]]\n|directed=[[Sue Mondt]]<br>[[Robert Alvarez]]<br>[[Phil Rynda]]\n|us=July 24, 2015\n|uk=May 21, 2015\n|arc=\n|pairedwith=\"[[Water Park]]\"\n|dvd=\n|badopt=\n|sqbooks=\n}}\n'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an episode from [[Season 2]] of ''[[The Chica Show]]''.
