The first block of new episodes premiered on November 6 with \"Fish Out of Water\". During the first block, a boxset of episodes was released on Sky Anytime. One of the episodes was \"Underwater Boy\", which at the time of the boxset release, had not premiered on Disney Channel. Over the Christmas period, there was no new episodes until January 8, 2011. Block 1 ended on January 29, 2011 with \"Baldwin the Super Fish\". During this block, new episodes ran on Saturdays only.\n===Block 2 (\"[[Tank Fish It's Friday!]]\")===\nJust over a month after Block 1 ended, Block 2 started in the form of weekly Friday new episodes, alongside new episodes of other shows in a promotion named \"Tank Fish It's Friday!\". Every Friday in March 2011, two episodes would air, one airing 55 minutes after the other (excluding March 4) Two days before the block started, episodes \"Milo Gets a Ninja\", \"Dances with Wolf Fish\", \"Hooray for Hamsterwood\" and \"The Tale of Sir Oscar Fish\" were released on a boxset on Sky Anytime. The first two episodes in the block, \"Milo Gets a Ninja\" and \"Dances with Wolf Fish\" aired in widescreen. Before the channel broadcast in widescreen later that year in the fall, only movies would air in the widescreen format. However, these two episodes had been sent to international networks in the same way - in widescreen. Every Disney Channel in the world who had not changed to widescreen would broadcast this episode in widescreen.\n===Block 3===\nAlmost three months after Block 2 ended, Block 3 started on June 11, 2011. This time, new episodes would air on Saturdays and Sundays. The episode \"Pamela Hamster Returns\" was accidentally scheduled on the same day as \"Parasite Fright\" was due to premiere. It aired late in the afternoon as \"NEW\". The date which the episode should have premiered, July 9, it aired as \"PREMIERE\". \"Good Morning, Freshwater\" aired on July 10, 8 days after the US premiere. Block 3 finished on July 17, 2011.\n===Block 4===\nNearly two months after Block 3 finished, Block 4 started. Disney Channel had switched to the new logo and the widescreen format on September 1, making the premiere of \"We've Got Fish Spirit\" on September 9 be the first time Disney Channel would broadcast a ''Fish Hooks'' premiere in proper widescreen. Only 4 episodes would air during Block 4, three would air in HD; Disney Channel switched to HD on September 15. On September 16, \"Fish School Musical\" aired, one week before its United States premiere. There was no premiere on September 23; Block 3 finished on September 30 with two new episodes.\n===Block 5===\nIn November 2011, Block 5 started. It began on November 5 with \"Milo on the Lam\", which did not premiere in the United States until 2 months and 1 day later. It had premiered in October in Canada. It ended on November 28 with \"Adventures in Fish-Sitting\".\n===Block 6===\nBlock 6 began in March 2012, the first block of 2012. The new episodes aired at 7:45am, the earliest time new ''Fish Hooks'' have aired in the UK. The previous blocks (excluding Block 2) have had new episodes air during 9am-10am.It continued from where Block 5 left off, premiering \"Banned Band\" on March 10. On March 11, \"Milo on the Lam\" aired as a \"premiere\", however it premiered in Block 5.

Milo forces Bea and Oscar to stay up with him to watch the movie. After it finishes, Milo gets scared that fish brain parasites will get him in his sleep and stays up all night. After watching the movie, Oscar gave it a bad review online. Principal Stickler has got the movie on tape. (\"[[Parasite Fright]]\")\n==Plot==\nDuring a thunderstorm, Jimmy, a fish, is put to bed by his father. The father warns him about not going to sleep, as he has heard reports of fish brain parasites being around that night. Jimmy closes his eyes, and an alien appears at the window. The alien comes through the window, when Jimmy's father comes into the room to check on his son after he heard a noise. A flash of light and the alien goes inside Jimmy's head. Jimmy suddenly opens his eyes. His father yells out \"Why did you fall asleep, Jimmy? Why?!\". At the lab, one of the scientists prove that Jimmy has got fish brain parasites, as when he prodded him on the eye, Jimmy didn't show any emotion. The other scientist isn't convinced and kicks the board which Jimmy is on to the floor of the laboratory. The scientist then falls asleep, not listening to the other's instructions on not to, when another alien appears, and in a flash of light, goes inside the scientist's head. The scientist then suddenly opens his eyes and as the movie ends, the other scientist yells out \"Curse you, fish brain parasites!\".\n==DVD Release==\nPrincipal Stickler purchased a copy of the movie on DVD, which featured a tip (probably a deleted scene) on how to remove fish brain parasites from fish, which is to release the fish into air, and the aliens will go to their respective planets.","timestamp":"20110503193436","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Fish_Broadway","comment":"Created page with \"'''Fish Broadway''' is a district where theatrical performances are presented in theaters along the district.

You assume the role of Milo and must master the art of making and popping bubbles to successfully navigate the treacherous waters of Randy's diabolical design. You will have to float, fall and fling yourself through the mazes to advance, all while maneuvering with the precision of a ninja (well, the fish version of a ninja. While you're in a bubble.) Perfect timing and puzzle solving skills are essential if you want to avoid the increasingly difficult obstacles and master all of the underwater moves you'll need to win. Have you got what it takes to BE THE BUBBLE?\n:Find out!, as you:\n\n*Play through more than 50 levels of marine madness!\n*Unlock 5 of Milo's best friends \u2013 who you can use as player characters in the game!\n*Master the art of bouncing off turtles!\n*Surf whirlpools, fly through tubes and free fall!\n*Collect apples in each level and max out your high score!\n*Beat Randy Pincherson at his own game and win back the trophy!\n==Story==\n[[Randy Pincherson]] is the new Tank Chopper 360 Bubble Grand Master Champion, which means he went around the all of the tanks in the pet store nothing but a bubble, and he awarded himself the trophy for his awesomeness. Milo checks the trophy out and says that Randy's gonna have to come at him harder, because he's tank-to-tanked the pet store bubble style a 'gazillion' times. Randy says that he has to prove it, and that if he wins, Randy's trophy is his, and if he loses, he pledges his fish loyalty and eternal servitude to him. Milo tells Randy to strap in, as he's about to get Miloed. Milo magics up a bubble and he floats off. Milo starts the challenge, and is soon aided by other fish.\n==External links==\n*[http:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/nz\/app\/disney-fish-hooks\/id550005327?mt=8 iTunes New Zealand - Disney Fish Hooks]\n*[http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=89ZiOJ-B4QM Disney Fish Hooks - Universal - HD Gameplay Trailer on iTunes]\n[[Category:Fish Hooks]]","timestamp":"20120815190644","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Fish_Hooks_Badges","comment":"Created page with \"'''Fish Hooks Badges''' were badges with ''[[Fish Hooks]]'' characters on.

Coach Salmons tries to get the students to move their fins by getting them to participate in a jumping challenge. You have to choose which character to jump from planks of wood to reach the top. There are three types of wood, the blue-painted moving wood, the brown-painted easily-cracking wood, and ordinary wood. You must avoid Jocktopus and his fellow bullies from pushing you to the bottom. If you jump on a turquoise-coloured sponge or a buff wheel, you are travelled to a higher plank of wood. Bea, Milo and Oscar are playable characters.\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallery|Freshwater Bounce menu.JPEG}}\n==External links==\n*[http:\/\/tv.disney.go.com\/disneychannel\/fishhooks\/games\/freshwaterbounce\/ Play the game at DisneyChannel.com]\n*[http:\/\/www.disney.co.uk\/fish-hooks\/games\/freshwater-bounce.jsp Play the game at DisneyChannel.co.uk]","timestamp":"20110225174652","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Freshwater_Castle","comment":"Created page with ''''Freshwater Castle''' is a castle in the village of [[Coralboard]], with medieval versions of the [[Freshwater High]] students.

Hank threw the ball once again, this time into a Tetra Tech player's hands. The player touchdowned, and Hank was then pelted with apples. He swam over to a bench and started crying. Oscar comforted him. Hank and Oscar hugged, with Oscar thinking that Hank was Bea Goldfishberg. Bea then arrived with lawyers to put an end to the supposed \"no girls allowed\" policy. [[Coach Salmons]] said the reason he didn't let Bea on the field is because she didn't have a helmet, making everyone in the football bowl say \"Oh!\". Hank gives Bea his helmet, and Hank says that he only wore the football uniform because he wanted to cover his enormous shoulders. Clamantha then puts his shoulders to good use - holding up the other cheerleaders. A player from the Tetra Tech team said they would just wait while the timer ran out. Coach told Bea to suit up, and Bea threw the football up into the air. A Tetra Tech player said that he got it, before Bea pushed him out of the way and kicked the football over the football post.

He shows the students how to complete the course, but Milo and Oscar don't want to do it. Coach Salmons offers Milo and Oscar the chance to go first, but Milo finds a way to get out of it - by pretending to have gotten [[The Ick]], a rare fish disease. Coach Salmons lets them outside to 'ease the ache', and once he's gone, they make their escape. They don't go too far, however, when they are caught by [[Jocktopus]] and his henchmen. Milo and Oscar are about to take part in a game of sardines, when Milo uses the \"Snapping Turtle Action\" technique, from the obstacle course, to help him and Oscar escape. Just as they are about to swim to the Hokey Poke, they swim into [[Bea]], whose [[Girls Griping at the Gym|theater production]] needs two understudies because [[Koi]] and [[Finberley]], who were supposed to play the lead parts, have just come down with [[The Ick]]. Oscar agrees to it immediately, and so does Milo, eventually. But, Oscar and Milo end up doing push-ups, so they take off their costumes and swim out. They see Coach Salmons in the hallway, so to avoid him, they take a shortcut out of the tank - going up a flag pole. At the bottom, is Jocktopus, who has finally caught up with them. Milo and Oscar fall to the ground and swim away from Jocktopus as fast as they can. Jocktopus chases them into the gym hall, where, in trying to escape, Milo and Oscar complete the obstacle course. Coach Salmons says they performed the fastest lap ever, and in reward they get a prize - which to Milo and Oscar's disappointment is the enrollment in the [[Inter-Aquarium Championships]], full of much harder obstacle courses and drills.\n\n==Credits==\n*Writer: Roberto Gagnor\n*Pencils and Inks: Federico Mancuso and Elisabetta Melaranci\n*Colors: Dario Calabria\n*Letters: Litomilano S.r.l.\n[[Category:Comics]]","timestamp":"20121228114117","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Gym_Class_Getaway\/Appearances","comment":"Created page with \"<center>[[Gym Class Getaway|Back to ''Gym Class Getaway''.]]<\/center> :''In order of appearance'': ==Characters== <gallery> File:blank.png|\"Snapping\" Turtle File:Coach Salmons...\"","content":"<center>[[Gym Class Getaway|Back to ''Gym Class Getaway''.]]<\/center>\n:''In order of appearance'':\n==Characters==\n<gallery>\nFile:blank.png|\"Snapping\" Turtle\nFile:Coach Salmons.JPEG|Coach Salmons\nFile:Steve Jackson.png|Steve Jackson\nFile:Albert Glass.JPEG|Albert Glass\nFile:Jumbo Shrimp.JPEG|Jumbo Shrimp\nFile:Milo praising Oscar's video game chair.PNG|Milo\nFile:Oscar looking at Jocktopus.JPEG|Oscar\nFile:Esmargot.png|Esmargot (flashback)\nFile:Finberley with cupcakes.png|Finberley (flashback; mentioned)\nFile:Shellsea.JPEG|Shellsea\nFile:Pass, Punt and Fumble.png|[[Fumble]]\nFile:Pass, Punt and Fumble.png|[[Punt]]\nFile:Pass, Punt and Fumble.png|[[Pass]]\nFile:Jocktopus with nerd fish balloons.png|Jocktopus Vandenbush\nFile:Bea Goldfishberg, actress superstar!.JPEG|Bea Goldfishberg\nFile:Koi.png|Koi (mentioned)\nFile:Mr. Baldwin telling Milo that he's late again.PNG|[[Mr. Baldwin]]\nFile:Clamantha.png|[[Clamantha]]\n<\/gallery>\n==Locations==\n<gallery>\nFile:Freshwater High.PNG|[[Freshwater High]]\nFile:Hokey Poke Diner.JPEG|Hokey Poke Diner (mentioned)\n<\/gallery>\n==Other==\n<gallery>\nFile:blank.png|The Fighting Fish\nFile:blank.png|The Ick (mentioned)\nFile:blank.png|''Girls Griping at the Gym''\nFile:blank.png|Inter-Aquarium Championships (mentioned)\n<\/gallery>\n[[Category:Appearances]]","timestamp":"20121228184024","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Hair_spray","comment":"Created page with \"[[File:Hair spray.png|right]] {{title|hair spray}} '''hair spray''' is a type of hair spray that comes in an aerosol.

Unfortunately, [[Principal Stickler]] and [[Nurse Fishington]] were nearby and Stickler asked Milo what they were talking about; he thought they were talking about bears in the nude. Milo told Stickler how he found a hair in the food, which prompted him to fire Latoada. She became upset, and Milo, feeling guilty, helped her find another job. Milo, Bea and Oscar realized that all Latoada wanted to do was to be a lunchlady, and so the gang took Latoada, in disguise, to the Lunchlady Tryouts at the school. Latoada presented her dish, grey mush, which prompted Sticker to re-hire her because he enjoyed the dish when he attended the school. Latoada came out of disguise too quickly and because of this, Stickler fired her again. After Milo told Stickler that it was Oscar's hair in the food, Latoada was re-hired and Oscar was fired, despite not having a job. As punishment, Milo was ordered to peel a excessive amount of onions.

The host was [[Mr. Mussels]], and the judges were [[Ms. Lips]], [[Coach Salmons]] and [[Bassy]]. The winner, Contestant #18 ([[Taylor Brooke]]), a baby, was crowned by [[Brandon Bubbler]].\n==Events and history==\n===Evening Gown Competition===\n[[Bea Goldfishberg]] (Contestant 27) didn't think she did that well in the evening gown competition, as the contestant that went after her got an \"Oooh\", and she didn't.\n===\"Asking Questions\" Competition===\nBea told Mr. Mussels that her biggest wish was to marry Brandon Bubbler, and then said that it was really world peace - both statements getting a low mark from the judges. Bea panicked and said something else that upset Ms. Lips. She ended off swimming off into the dressing rooms crying. \n===Talent Competition===\nBea had put too much makeup on and floated dazed onto the stage. She sat down onto the seat of the piano, and then blacked out, falling onto the keyboard of the piano.\n===Model Competition===\n[[Milo]] told Bea that to win, she had to be cute, which no talent judge could resist. When it was Bea's turn, she came onto the stage holding a giant lollipop and wearing a dress, completing the young child look. Bea then pulled a rope, and the curtains were pulled aside to reveal animals from the pet store behind her, wearing a 'fish-bowl' around their heads so they could breathe. Everyone in the audience started taking pictures, which panicked the three animals. They ran riot around the fish tank, causing everyone to flee. Brandon Bubbler's bodyguards left him, and the duck was about to stand on him before Bea swam upto the duck and managed to hold the duck off with her lollipop. She also managed to corner the animals, making them crash out of the hotel. \n===After the pageant===\nOnce the winner was crowned, Milo apologized for what happened, but Bea's spirits were lifted when she received a letter from Brandon Bubbler thanking her for saving his life. \n==Appearances==\n*{{EpApp|Little Fish Sunshine}}\n[[Category:Events]]","timestamp":"20120916104655","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Little_Sunshine","comment":"Phinbart moved page [[Little Sunshine]] to [[Little Fish Sunshine]]","content":"#REDIRECT [[Little Fish Sunshine]]","timestamp":"20120615163558","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Location_Guide","comment":"Redirected page to [[Category:Locations]]","content":"#REDIRECT [[Category:Locations]]","timestamp":"20101226115229","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Locura_Submarina","comment":"Created page with \"'''Locura Submarina''' was a 2-hour marathon on Disney Channel PE that aired on April 2, 2011.<ref>http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bu4ZJvjgM6s<\/ref> ==References== {{reflist}}\"","content":"'''Locura Submarina''' was a 2-hour marathon on Disney Channel PE that aired on April 2, 2011.<ref>http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bu4ZJvjgM6s<\/ref>\n==References==\n{{reflist}}","timestamp":"20110507203754","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Lonnie","comment":"Created page with \"[[File:Lonnie.png|250px|thumb|right|]] {{quote|No thank you!|Lonnie|Banned Band}} '''Lonnie''' is the evil leader of the [[Freshwater High Marching Band]]. ==Appearances== *{{...\"","content":"[[File:Lonnie.png|250px|thumb|right|]]\n{{quote|No thank you!|Lonnie|Banned Band}}\n'''Lonnie''' is the evil leader of the [[Freshwater High Marching Band]].\n==Appearances==\n*{{EpApp|Banned Band}}\n[[Category:Characters]]","timestamp":"20120603125830","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Lover's_Tank","comment":"Redirected page to [[L\u2665vers Tank]]","content":"#REDIRECT [[L\u2665vers Tank]]","timestamp":"20110225104242","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Low-Light","comment":"Created page with \"'''Low-Light''' is a movie about vampires. ==Appearances== *{{EpApp|Chicks Dig Vampires}} [[Category:Movies]]\"","content":"'''Low-Light''' is a movie about vampires.\n==Appearances==\n*{{EpApp|Chicks Dig Vampires}}\n[[Category:Movies]]","timestamp":"20121006162455","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Ludwig_Fish_Beethoven","comment":"Created page with \"'''Ludwig Fish Beethoven''' is a famous musician.

I get nine million emails a day and sometimes it takes me a while to respond. Here are some answers\u2026\n\n-There's no DVD coming out yet. I don't know about merch yet, but it seems likely that their will be some at some point.\u00a0<br\/>\n-'Fishtooth' is NOT their last name.\u00a0<br\/>\n-'Norman' is Bea's dad. I do his voice on the show. Woo! <br\/>\n-22 episodes in both (I think, I may need to double check that)<br\/>\n-They don't have names.\u00a0<br\/>\n-There are more games in the works, I just tested a new one out on Monday! <br\/>\n\nThanks for the questions, I'm always happy to answer them, but don't be shocked if it takes a while.\u00a0<br\/>\nThanks for watching! <br\/>\n-Noah","timestamp":"20110502214048","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"2","title":"Phinbart\/Episode_list","comment":"Created page with \"{| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

It is compatible with iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, iPod touch (3rd & 4th generations) and iPad. It requires iOS 4.0 or later.\n\nPlayers have to help [[Milo]] and other fish to complete a challenge by helping them reach the exit in just a bubble, while collecting apples along the way.\n\n''Fish Hooks'' is an underwater physics-based adventure puzzle starring Milo the fish and a host of his aquatic friends from Freshwater High. You assume the role of Milo and must master the art of making and popping bubbles to successfully navigate the treacherous waters of Randy's diabolical design. You will have to float, fall and fling yourself through the mazes to advance, all while maneuvering with the precision of a ninja (well, the fish version of a ninja. While you're in a bubble.) Perfect timing and puzzle solving skills are essential if you want to avoid the increasingly difficult obstacles and master all of the underwater moves you'll need to win.

The choices are case sensitive (\"adult\" is not the same as \"Adult\") and the selection is also used to add the page to the appropriate category.<br>\nKid: light orange<br> Teen: orange<br> Adult: red<br> Senior: maroon<br> Animal: dark brown<br> Robot: light grey<br> Alien: forest green<br> Monster: purple\n\nThe color also sets the category for the character. For example, '''color=Kid''' creates '''Category:Kids'''. (The user version of this Infobox, [[:Template:Infobox user character]], will not auto-create this category.)\n|- valign=top\n| name\n| Name to display at the top of the Infobox. <span style=\"color:mediumblue\"><tt><nowiki>{{PAGENAME}}<\/nowiki><\/tt><\/span> should be used in most situations in case the page has to be moved to a new name.\n|- valign=top\n| image\n| The name of the picture to be displayed, without the brackets or the \"File:\" prefix. Size is fixed at 200px, so images in a 4:3 aspect ratio are preferred over widescreen images.<br>\nExample: &nbsp; <span style=\"color:mediumblue\"><tt><nowiki>Bea Goldfishberg.png<\/nowiki><\/tt><\/span><br> instead of: <span style=\"color:mediumblue\"><tt><nowiki>[[File:Bea Goldfishberg.png]]<\/nowiki><\/tt><\/span> <br>\nIf the picture is not specified, it will use '''No Screenshot 2.png''' as a default.\n\n'''User infobox:''' The full file command should be used (that is <span style=\"color:mediumblue\"><tt><nowiki>[[File:Bea Goldfishberg.png|200px]]<\/nowiki><\/tt><\/span> instead of <span style=\"color:mediumblue\"><tt><nowiki>Bea Goldfishberg.png<\/nowiki><\/tt><\/span>) and should be set to a maximum of 200px size. This will allow for \"hotlinking\" to external sites by specifying the full URL (<span style=\"color:mediumblue\"><tt><nowiki>http:\/\/www.site.com\/picture.jpg<\/nowiki><\/tt><\/span>). Keep in mind that hotlinked pictures will display at full size.

Typically, each character only has one nemesis.\n|- valign=top\n| band\n| The name of the band the character belongs to.<br>\n(''\"Position in (band)\" will only be displayed if the '''pband''' parameter is used.'')\n|- valign=top\n| pband {{Diamond}} {{Club}}\n| The position in the band the character occupies (lead singer, drummer, etc.)\n|- valign=top\n| profession {{Diamond}} {{Club}}\n| The profession or job the character has.\n|- valign=top\n| major {{Diamond}} {{Club}}\n| The character's major field of study.\n|- valign=top\n| affiliations {{Diamond}} {{Club}}\n| The group(s) the character belongs to.\n|- valign=top\n| signature {{Diamond}} {{Club}}\n| If the character's signature has been shown in an episode, include a picture of it here. Do not include the brackets or the \"File:\" prefix. Size is fixed at 150px.<br>\nExample: <span style=\"color:mediumblue\"><tt><nowiki>Milo's signature.png<\/nowiki><\/tt><\/span><br> instead of: <span style=\"color:mediumblue\"><tt><nowiki>[[File:Milo's signature.png]]<\/nowiki><\/tt><\/span> \n|- valign=top\n| parents {{Diamond}}\n| One or both of the character's parents if known.\n|- valign=top\n| creator {{Diamond}}\n| The character's creator, if the character is a robot or monster.\n|- valign=top\n| stepparents {{Diamond}}\n| The adoptive parent(s) of the character.\n|- valign=top\n| siblings {{Diamond}}\n| Any known brothers or sisters.\n|- valign=top\n| stepsiblings {{Diamond}}\n| Stepbrothers or stepsisters.\n|- valign=top\n| grandparents {{Diamond}}\n| The grandparent(s) of the character.\n|- valign=top\n| spouses {{Diamond}}\n| Any known current or former spouses of the character.\n|- valign=top\n| children {{Diamond}}\n| The children of the character.

Use the \"title\" to define the name of that category, and the matching \"other\" for the information in that category. Example:<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style=\"color:mediumblue\"><tt>title1 = Assistant<\/tt><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style=\"color:mediumblue\"><tt><nowiki>other1 = [[Nurse Fishington]]<\/nowiki><\/tt><\/span>\n|- valign=top\n| other1, other2, other3, other4 {{Diamond}}\n|- valign=top\n| first\n| The first appearance of the character. In most cases this will be the first time they are seen on screen. If they are mentioned prior to their first on-screen appearance or have a speaking cameo where they are not seen, this should be noted in the \"Appearances\" section of the character's page.\n|- valign=top\n| voice {{Diamond}}\n| The actor that provided the voice for the character.\n|- valign=top\n| image2, image3 {{Diamond}}\n| rowspan=2 | Optional pictures and captions that may be included, such as a picture of the voice actor, or an addition picture of the character such as Pamela Hamster's star on the Hamsterwood Walk of Fame.<br>\nSame format as the \"image\" parameter above.\n|- valign=top\n| caption2, caption3 {{Diamond}}\n|}\n\n{{Spacer}}\nValues marked with {{Diamond}} will not be displayed in the Infobox if they are empty or if that line is missing.\n\nValues marked with {{Club}} indicate that at least one must be used in order for the section divider that it is in to be displayed.\n\nWhenever it is necessary to specify more than one item, use the line breaks as follows:<br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style=\"color:mediumblue\"><tt><nowiki>[[page 1]]<br> [[page 2]]<\/nowiki><\/tt><\/span><br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; instead of:<br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style=\"color:mediumblue\"><tt><nowiki>[[page 1]]<br><\/nowiki><\/tt><\/span><br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style=\"color:mediumblue\"><tt><nowiki>[[page 2]]<\/nowiki><\/tt><\/span>\n\nThe vertical spacing between the items will be different if they are put on separate lines as shown above. By keeping them on the same line, the vertical spacing will look correct. The explanation for the \"image\" parameter in the table above shows both the extra spacing and the normal spacing.\n\n''(The code for some fields have been split onto separate lines in order to display correctly next to the example Infobox without sideways scrolling. When entering data into the parameters, do not break the code into separate lines.)''\n<noinclude>[[Category:Infobox templates|{{PAGENAME}}]]\n[[Category:Template documentation|{{PAGENAME}}]]<\/noinclude>","timestamp":"20110115160457","user-timestamp":"20101107092214","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"10","title":"Infobox_character_2","comment":"Created page with \"<includeonly>{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width:200px; -moz-border-radius:10px;\" style=\"float: right\" cellpadding=0 border=0 |- |  {| style=\"width:200px; text-align:left; font-si...\"","content":"<includeonly>{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width:200px; -moz-border-radius:10px;\" style=\"float: right\" cellpadding=0 border=0\n|-\n| \n{| style=\"width:200px; text-align:left; font-size: 90%;\" border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0\n|-\n!

Milo is self-described a \"party guy\" who\u2026'","content":"====Milo Fishtooth====\n([[Kyle Massey]])is a adolescent who happens to be a Siamese fighting fish and the main protagonist of the series. Milo is self-described a \"party guy\" who tries to have fun on any situations. He is very loud and loves to go on wild adventures and throw parties. He's 16 years old, and is friends with Bea, a female who is an aspiring actress, and is also very friendly with his brother, Oscar, who is very nervous when it comes to girls, and loves to play video games.In \"Fail Fish\", Milo is shown to have attention disables, and passed his test with the help of Bea and Oscar, who did dangerous stuff cause that's how Milo learns.He's afraid of losing Bea, as shown in \"Fish Sleepover Party\".So he and Oscar disguised as girls to sneak to thier party.He, as stated by Mr. Baldwin, is a \"selfish fish\".In \"Fish Out Of Water\", he ventered outside the tanks in watersuits, along with Oscar and Bea.In \"Underwater Boy\", he tries out for football to get attention, but ends up as water boy.He thought Mr. Baldwin was the comic superhero, Captain Aquarium.He got a dog for Oscar named Murphy, and Oscar drove him away, so Milo, Bea, and Oscar try to find him.At the end of the episode, Milo got a horse.He is knowned by Oscar, as lazy, as he doesn't wash his underwear.[[File:FishHooksCast.jpg|thum|right|Milo,Oscar,and Bea]]\n\n====Bea Goldfishberg====\n([[Chelsea Stuab]])is a goldfish who is very \"overly dramatic\", and wants to be a movie star. Her friend, Oscar, has a huge and regularly unspoken crush on her, and she is obviously oblivious to this. She even once said Oscar is her boyfriend, but it turns out she was just \"acting\" so Clamantha could get away from Oscar. However, she may have some feelings for his brother, Milo, due to their close bond and her constant concern of him. She claims that she is the most beautiful fish of all time, despite her friends not agreeing so. In the episode \"Underwater Boy\", it is shown that she is a fan of football. As shown in several episodes, both her parents are extremely overprotective of her and treat her like a baby, so she once tried to take a job at Fish Flakes inc., but eventually get's sick of it and quits.When the students had to give presents in Jocktopuses birthday, Bea says she's too talented to be punched, and tells a really long story about her being a \"delivery female\" to distract Jocktopus. She doesn't mind going on adventures, as long as she could be with her friends. She really close to her best friend, Shellsea, as they always chat and hang out.Bea seems to be a dramatic to most situations, like when she and Milo tried to sneak in Clamantha's yearbook office, but it turns out her picture was perfectly fine. She's the tritagonist of the show. She is 16.\n\n====Oscar Fishtooth====\n\nOscar(voiced by Justin Roiland) is the brother of Milo and a routinely nervous fish who Clamantha, a student of Freshwater High, is infatuated with and has opened a shrine to.[3] He is a video game lover and has a good relationship with Bea and mostly Milo (due to their brotherhood). Oscar is hyper and crazy a lot throughout the series, mostly cause of Milo's crazy adventures. Similar to Clamantha, he has opened a shrine to his crush, Bea. He doesn't exactly want anybody to notice he has a crush on her, like when Bea saw his drawing of them, he snatched it and ripped it to pieces.Though he would like her to notice. He's 16 years old. In the episode Doggonit after he yells at Murphy causing him to run away Oscar reveals that he is half beta fish, and that he didnt mean what he said because beta fish are very passionate. He is terrified of Clamantha, as she has a crush on him, in which he dispites. Oscar gave money to Jocktopus on his birthday, but Jocktopus calls it \"worthless paper', so Oscar gets tangled up in trouble. He made up a fake girlfriend named Doris Flors Gorgeous so he doesn't have to worry about not going on dates with nobody.Unlike his brother Milo, he doesn't like to go on adventures, and only does cause Milo or Bea asks him to, so that makes Oscar more of a neutral character. He is the deuteragonist of the series.\n\n====Secondary Chrachters====\n\n====Clamantha,the teenage clam====\nClamantha(voiced by Alex Hirsch)is a crazy clam who attends Freshwater High. She is friends with Bea and often gives her \"pearls of wisdom\".

When Bea needed entertainment for the fake school dance, Clamantha volunteered to play music, in which she has a band called \"Clamantha and the Shiny Objects\". Clamantha was invited to Bea's sleepover party and didn't notice Milo and Oscar was on girl disguises to the point of exploding out of confussion. She, along with other girls tried to help Milo study, but Clamantha coudn't remember her line. Her catchphraise is \"I'm a clam!\", which she says throughout the series.\n\n\n====Jocktopus====\nJocktopus Ludwig Vandenbush(voiced by John DiMaggio)is the school bully that is an octopus and the show's primary antagonist.

Although grades isn't his strong point, he supports Freshwater High by playing on the school football team with his gang of Pass, Punt and Fumble. Jocktopus always speaks in the third person. He had his first major role in Underwater Boy, where he doesn't appereciate Milo's \"skills' when he did the tryouts, but later cheers for him after they won the game. He then appears in Happy Birthfish, Jocktopus, which is a episode all around him. After Milo, Bea, and Oscar saw what happened to Sunny after he gave Jocktopus his money, Oscar puts all the money in his hair. Bea then quickly shoves Oscar to Jocktopus, and he soon finds out that Oscar is smart, as he helped him with his bullying by making cards, a dice, and a machine that randomely selects Jocktopuses next victimn. When the device selects Milo and Bea, Oscar tries to prevent Jocktopus from beating them up, so he makes the machine get on Jocktopus, so he starts beating himself up.

He put Albert in detention for staying in the hallway too long. He's a serious teacher who doesn't like jokes. He also got a job at Fish Flakes inc. He had his biggest role in Baldwin the Super Fish, cause Milo thought Mr. Baldwin was a comic superhero who fights for crime and justice. So Milo, Bea, and Oscar tried to tak pictures and spied on him for Bea's journalismn story.When he doesn't do anything heroic, Milo lets Oscar disguised as a villain and he trapped himself in a glass cup full of water. Bea took a picture, which made Mr. Baldwin stunned and he accedently let go of the cup, so everyone fell into the shark tank. The sharks were vegetarians so they didn't eat them\n\n====Coach Salmons====\nCoach Salmons(voiced by Richard Simmons)is a salmon[3] and the enthusiastic physical education coach and is quick to offer motivation or a diagram of the food pyramid.

He enjoys spicing up boring exercize routines and likes students who always tries thier best and doesn't give up. When Milo signed up for football, Coach Salmons saw how Milo did in the tryouts and thought he did great, despite Jocktopuses complaints. So he made Milo water boy and said that being water boy is his destiny. Milo later got back to the field and notices the game is in the gecko tank, which is really hot.

He is generally cool and laid back and tries to help the students when they have problems, although he never seems to be of much help in the long run. He is mostly seen cleaning the tanks to make them clean. His first appearance is in the pilot episode when Bea had to wait until Clamantha gets out of the yearbook office, he said that she's never coming out of that room. This gave Bea doubt but it is likely he didn't mean to do it, since his eyes were closed. He then had a brief cameo in Doris Flores Gorgeous, where he was holding the ladder when they had to get Milo's head out of the pipe. He gave Milo advice when he told him that the football game is in the gecko tank, which is VERY hot. He is seen sucking tanks in Bea Becomes an Adult Fish, and Funny Fish.\n\n\n====Koi====\nKoi(voiced by Rachel Dratch) is the biggest fish in Freshwater High, bigger than Jocktopus even. She may appear big and scary, but she hs a lot of heart. Koi is also quite of a jokester, as she makes jokes, which makes her friends say \"Oh, Koi!\" and laughs. She was invited to Bea's sleepover party. When Milo and Oscar sneaked to thier party, Koi seemed to be the most visaubly angriest. So she picked Milo and Oscar up and tortured them. In Fail Fish, Koi and the girls tried to help Milo study, by making a plat, that has to do with the first Fishgiving. Koi makes grunting noises and doesn't talk much either. She is friends with Bea and Shellsea along with thier circle of friends. Like Jocktopus, Koi is one of the strongest in the school. When the board said the dance was \"tommorow\", Koi ripped it off to say \"today\". Koi, and Bea's other friends could communicate with Bea in her laptop, where thay discuss about boys and dating. She is a Koi fish.\n\n\n====Albert Glass====\n\nAlbert Glass(voiced by Atticus Shaffer)is a smart but somehow nervous jellyfish. He is mostly seen being bullied by Jocktopus, and as such is the school nerd. He has a love for the drama club and for that he can somewhat connect with Bea. Albert is in the map club and likes the unfolding part. He usually roams in the halls with his best friend Jumbo Shrimp. Albert tried out for the school auditions, but he didn't get the part and got scared by Mr. Mussels. In Happy Birthfish, Jocktopus, Albert was the first victimn for Jocktopus. When Mr. Baldwin spotted Jocktopus punching ann injured Albert, he made Albert in detention for standing in the hallway too long. When Milo needed to study for his test, Albert and Jumbo tried to help him by doing a stragety game, but Milo has NO idea whats going on. When Oscar wanted to get a new rommate, Albert was the first one and Oscar was about to choose him, until he drank seaweed milk, and since his head is transparent, the milk got in his head visuably\n \n====Principal Stickler====\nPrincipal Stickler(voiced by Jerry Stiller)is a paranoid sea urchin[3] authoritarian who screams out orders to his assistant, Nurse Fishington. He presented Oscar with the popular student award when Oscar tried to be funny. He makes Nurse Fishington do lts of stuff like pushing his chair and various other stuff. When Oscar tried to find a new roommate, Principal Stickler had his biggest part wher he was shown to be a clean freak like Oscar. He and Oscar was doing great at first, but it later got messed up when Oscar and Stickler watched T.V and Stickler didn't like the show Oscar liked, so he told Oscar to throw him. He did, but he smashed the T.V.Then when Principal Stickler vaccumed, he started vaccuming off Oscar's braces, and blew on his eye. Then when Milo came, the wolf fish started to attack Stickler, so he used his vac\n\n====Jumbo shrimp====\nJumbo Shrimp(voiced by TBA)is, according to the name is a big shrimp with an orange waist bag that has many brief cameoes in most episodes. He has two front teeth and his eyes are far apart. Jumbo keeps interesting stuff in his orange pouch. Like his best friend Albert Glass, Jumbo is the school nerd. Jumbo enjoys learning, reading, doing math, science, and like Albert, learns, learns, and learns. In Fail Fish when Milo neede to pass his test, Jumbo and Albert tried to help by doing a medevil stragety game, but didn't succeed. Jumbo's name is briefly seen in the yearbook in the end of Bea Stays in the Picture. Since he never talked so far in the series and the fact that all of his appearances are non-speaking cameoes, not much is known about him.\n\n====Piranhica====\nPiranhica(voiced by Laura Ortiz) is manipulative, intimidating and almost as mean as her boyfriend Jocktopus. She is a piranha[3] , naturally, she likes to manipulate and intimidate the other students of Freshwater High to do her biding, and at some points that includes Jocktopus, even though he's too dumb to realize it, but she is head over fins in love with him. She really hates nerds (Albert and Jumbo) and annoying people. In Happy Birthfish, Jocktopus, Pirahnica helped Jocktopus with his presents and collects the worthless paper (money). She says that \"Jocktopus can smell fear\". Towards the end of the episode, Pirahnica sees Jocktopus punching himself and says he embarrasses her, but then calls him a big dreamy hunk.
