It has only became practical in the past seven to eight years as 3D printers have come down in price.  The University of Idaho uses 3D printing to rapid prototype plastic parts to be used in student projects. Currently the University has two 3D printers available for use, the BST 1200 and MakerBot Replicator 2.\n\n==Differences==\n\n==Makerbot==\n\n==BST 1200==\n\nThe old 3D printer (BST 1200) at University of Idaho was tens of thousands for the machine and ten dollars a cubic inch for printing material.  The new 3D printer (Makerbot) was a few thousand to purchase and is one dollar a cubic inch for printing material. \n'''\nIMAGES!!!\n'''\nThe change in costs came down significantly for several reasons. First, as 3D printing becomes more popular mass production lowers the cost of the machine. Also, new improvements in manufacturing technologies make the printers less to produce because the components are easier to make and more common in other machines. The newer machines also fill the missed market of midrange quality printers that was being ignored. However, the biggest change in price is the material being used. Instead of using Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic like the BST 1200, Makerbot uses Polylactic acid (PLA) plastic.\nMakerbot does not have the quality of the BST 1200. This is because of the property differences in the material and the quality of the machines. A good example of this is the smoothness that parts made with the BST 1200 have. Parts from Makerbot can only as smooth if sanding is done after the printing process. \nMakerbot also does not build arches and overhangs well. BST 1200 uses a separate type of plastic to support arches and overhangs. The support material can be broken off fairly easily. Makerbot can provide supports by printing thin sections of PLA, but this results in a fairly rigid print that will need a great deal of post print sanding.\nOverall the older high-end machines are still better at making precision parts, but the new lower cost machines will fulfill the everyday needs of a typical user. It safe to think of the older machines as a new car. They are reliable, always do what you want, and don\u2019t take any tinkering but cost quite a bit to buy and maintain. The new low cost machine are more like buying a classic car. They aren\u2019t as reliable, only sometime preform as intended, and take some tinkering to make work right, but they are less to purchase, maintain and cool to show off to your friends.\n3D Printing Developed Description\n3D printers work by taking computer generated code and laying plastic down in layers to build a solid 3D model. \n \nCode generation via ReplicatorG\nThe code is generated by a computer program that takes the coordinates of the 3D model and slices it into layers across the Z axis. It then calculate the areas to be filled for the XY plane for each layer.  To conserve plastic, the machine will automatically hollow the object and create a support structure system in the hollowed space.\nWhen read by the machine, the code provides the XY coordinates of where to lay plastic. \n \nIn Progress Print on Makerbot 3D Printer\nBefore the machine can begin its print it has to be set up, this includes verifying the tray is level and waiting for the machine to heat up. Preheating is necessary for the part to be built properly. After the code is loaded and preheating is done; the machine can begin its print.\nPrinting is accomplished by moving a hot needle across the print table with two stepper motors. The motors are controlled by the printer\u2019s computer unit so their location is always known. This process is works like a typical CNC machine. The needle that lays the plastic controls its flow based on the temperature. Only in advanced systems will the temperature change after the preheat is done. \n \nFinished 3D Print\nOnce the first layer is complete, a third stepper motor moves the print table down across the Z so the next layer can print. This process is repeated for each layer until the part is complete.  \nFinished parts typically come out rougher than desired. To get the part to meet a tolerance sanding, drilling and other machining processes can be done","timestamp":"20130529224648","user-timestamp":"20130528175121","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"4th_Axis_(HAAS_Mill)","comment":"Created page with \"'''Step 1: Add yourself as owner on the discussion page'''  This page provides a basic tutorial on ...

The control-loop governs the existing system such that it dynamically responds as if it were a different, larger generator powered by hydroelectric, steam, or gas.\n\n==Project Definition==\n\n===Schematic of the System===\n\n\n{| width=\"100%\" border=\"0\"\n\n|- align=\"left\"\n| [[File:2015_Byte_Back_snapshot_3.png]] ||\n|-\n|}\n\n===Specifications===\n\nHard fast specifications for this project have not been communicated, which is normal for senior design. Instead, we have been given boundary performance metrics and are asked to develop minimum specifications based upon industry standards. \n\nThe first performance metric to discuss is Settling Time (ST). ST will be defined (at least for this paper) as the time between a deviation of output frequency from the system setpoint and the moment when the system returns to the setpoint with no significant over or undershoot. Thus, the current system performance will be used to establish existing performance for our project. Dr. Johnson has further clarified that many power system governors have ST values around 5 seconds, and this is considered good performance in the industry. \n\nThe second performance metric to discuss is precision. Dr. Johnson suggested we consider how tightly we will control frequency. For instance, will the output frequency be controlled to 60 with an error of 1 hz, or an error of .1 hz, or .01 hz. The key here is to what precision with the output frequency be held to its set point. \n\n{| width=\"100%\" border=\"0\"\n\n|- align=\"left\"\n| [[File:2015_Byte_Back_snapshot_4.png]] ||\n|-\n|}\n\n===Objective===\nA power system is used to develop power at a specific voltage and frequency. Load changes on the output of a power\u00adgenerating system will cause fluctuations in both voltage and frequency. The fluctuations are undesirable and must be prevented or at least mitigated. The power system can be monitored in terms of its electrical frequency or its mechanical frequency.\n\nThe power system that has provided to the University of Idaho will ultimately be used for an Advanced Power Lab. SEL has requested that the team work at cleaning up the lab and making it a professional, clean atmosphere that is safe and conducive to learning.\n\nThe specific power system for this project consists of a VFD driving an induction motor. The induction motor is coupled to a synchronous generator. At the output of the synchronous generator is a shaft\u00adposition digital\u00adencoder. (There is also a DC source for supplying the generator field, but that is part of another project.) Currently, the VFD controls the induction motor as a governor. The fact that electrical power, Real(3*EA*IA) is equal to mechanical power T*(W \u00adangle a) is used by the VFD. Since it knows the voltage applied (E) and the current drawn (IA) it can infer what the torque (T) and radial frequency (W) are. The inference that the VFD must do can be improved by experimentally determining exact values for system characteristics, like the inertia of the system or its intrinsic time constant. The IEEE publishes models that include critical characteristics of power systems that allow governors to act with greater response and accuracy. A major deliverable of the team is to experimentally improve the values for these characteristics and update the VFD parameters with these values. The team intends to write experimental procedures for each characteristic requiring testing and providing these test procedures as part of our final deliverable.\n\nA second method for controlling the power system is using an external system that dynamically adjusts feedback from the output encoder of the generator to the input of the VFD. The method of feedback control requires an external system to monitor the mechanical or electrical frequency of the output and comparing that against a set point. Depending upon the magnitude of the error, a compensating feedback signal must be applied to the VFD to drive the system back to the power as quickly as possible. The VFD provides inputs for implementing this control scheme as well.\n\n==Project Learning==\n\n===MODBUS & EFB===\n\n[[File: 2015_Byte_Back_snapshot_6.png|thumb|right|500px|]]\n[[File: 2015_Byte_Back_snapshot_5.png|thumb|right|500px|]]\n\nThe code to construct and send simple MODBUS data packets has been written and is currently undergoing tests on the hardware and VFD.

The control-loop governs the existing system such that it dynamically responds as if it were a different, larger generator powered by hydroelectric, steam, or gas.\n\n==Project Definition==\n\n===Schematic of the System===\n\n\n{| width=\"100%\" border=\"0\"\n\n|- align=\"left\"\n| [[File:2015_Byte_Back_snapshot_3.png]] ||\n|-\n|}\n\n===Specifications===\n\nHard fast specifications for this project have not been communicated, which is normal for senior design. Instead, we have been given boundary performance metrics and are asked to develop minimum specifications based upon industry standards. \n\nThe first performance metric to discuss is Settling Time (ST). ST will be defined (at least for this paper) as the time between a deviation of output frequency from the system setpoint and the moment when the system returns to the setpoint with no significant over or undershoot. Thus, the current system performance will be used to establish existing performance for our project. Dr. Johnson has further clarified that many power system governors have ST values around 5 seconds, and this is considered good performance in the industry. \n\nThe second performance metric to discuss is precision. Dr. Johnson suggested we consider how tightly we will control frequency. For instance, will the output frequency be controlled to 60 with an error of 1 hz, or an error of .1 hz, or .01 hz. The key here is to what precision with the output frequency be held to its set point. \n\n{| width=\"100%\" border=\"0\"\n\n|- align=\"left\"\n| [[File:2015_Byte_Back_snapshot_4.png]] ||\n|-\n|}\n\n===Objective===\nA power system is used to develop power at a specific voltage and frequency. Load changes on the output of a power\u00adgenerating system will cause fluctuations in both voltage and frequency. The fluctuations are undesirable and must be prevented or at least mitigated. The power system can be monitored in terms of its electrical frequency or its mechanical frequency.\n\nThe power system that has provided to the University of Idaho will ultimately be used for an Advanced Power Lab. SEL has requested that the team work at cleaning up the lab and making it a professional, clean atmosphere that is safe and conducive to learning.\n\nThe specific power system for this project consists of a VFD driving an induction motor. The induction motor is coupled to a synchronous generator. At the output of the synchronous generator is a shaft\u00adposition digital\u00adencoder. (There is also a DC source for supplying the generator field, but that is part of another project.) Currently, the VFD controls the induction motor as a governor. The fact that electrical power, Real(3*EA*IA) is equal to mechanical power T*(W \u00adangle a) is used by the VFD. Since it knows the voltage applied (E) and the current drawn (IA) it can infer what the torque (T) and radial frequency (W) are. The inference that the VFD must do can be improved by experimentally determining exact values for system characteristics, like the inertia of the system or its intrinsic time constant. The IEEE publishes models that include critical characteristics of power systems that allow governors to act with greater response and accuracy. A major deliverable of the team is to experimentally improve the values for these characteristics and update the VFD parameters with these values. The team intends to write experimental procedures for each characteristic requiring testing and providing these test procedures as part of our final deliverable.\n\nA second method for controlling the power system is using an external system that dynamically adjusts feedback from the output encoder of the generator to the input of the VFD. The method of feedback control requires an external system to monitor the mechanical or electrical frequency of the output and comparing that against a set point. Depending upon the magnitude of the error, a compensating feedback signal must be applied to the VFD to drive the system back to the power as quickly as possible. The VFD provides inputs for implementing this control scheme as well.\n\n==Project Learning==\n\n===MODBUS & EFB===\n\n[[File: 2015_Byte_Back_snapshot_6.png|thumb|right|500px|]]\n[[File: 2015_Byte_Back_snapshot_5.png|thumb|right|500px|]]\n\nThe code to construct and send simple MODBUS data packets has been written and is currently undergoing tests on the hardware and VFD.

The plan was to collaborate between their disciplines and create a finely tuned, expertly engineered drum set that is fit for a full on-field marching band performance.\n\nThe Fall of 2011 marked the initial experimentation and design of the Beest by a Capstone Design team in the engineering department. These initial tests provided insight on what worked well and what needed improvement. The final design from this year was never seen outside of the engineering buildings on campus, but the following year's goals were clear and a new design began immediately. For more in depth design details refer to the [http:\/\/seniordesign.engr.uidaho.edu\/2011-2012\/drumroll\/main.html '''Team Drum Roll'''] webpage.\n\nThe Fall of 2012 marked the first public introduction of the Beest, which has become a yearly project in the Capstone Design process. Dan Mathewson, a University of Idaho graduate student, designed and utilized a robotic, power driven front wheel that responded to the drummers input and included brightly lit led's on the forward facing drums. It successfully astounded the audience and fulfilled the requirement of marching with a wheeled drum set, but it could still be improved. Dan's thesis can be found in the [[Band-Beesten rolling drum set#References|'''References''']] section.\n\nThe goal of the 2013 Band-Beesten Experience team is to recreate the Beest to operate fully under the drummer control without the robotic assistance while making it bigger and better than before.\n\n[[#toc|''Return to contents'']]\n\n==Design Specifications==\n:'''Carry at minimum:'''\n::*One 14\u201d diameter, 8\u201d deep, 8lb Timbale\n::*One 15\u201d diameter, 8\u201d deep, 9lb Timbale\n::*One 14\u201d diameter, 4\u201d deep, 13lb snare\n::*One 18\u201d diameter, 4lb cymbal\n::*One 19\u201d diameter, 7lb roto-tom\n:'''General features:'''\n::*Move in all directions on a single plane (forward, backward, side to side, and radially)\n::*Move freely in those directions at marching speeds up to 2 m\/s\n::*Adjust to a wide range of user heights \n::*Lightweight, ~100lbs\n::*Free-standing\n::*Human powered (No motored assistance)\n\n[[#toc|''Return to contents'']]\n\n==Project Learning==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\"|\n!  style=\"text-align: left;\"|Interviewee\n!  style=\"text-align: left;\"|Overview\n\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|'''Dan Mathewson'''\nGraduate student who worked on 2012 Band Beesten model\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|\n\n'''Frame and Omni-Wheel Tips'''\n:*Single omni-wheels were used because he wanted a constant contact surface on the ball for the drive system, which also reduced the cost.\n:*Suggested exploring other omni-wheel configurations and testing to see which is more efficient\/easy to maneuver.

top and bottom rings.\n\nEach ring is connected rigidly in a triangular shape with a series of tubes and clamps, while using the weight of the drum set to keep the ball in place.\n\n|valign=\"top\"

test the friction coefficients of casters and omni-wheels.\n\nThe apparatus allows for the use of both casters and omni-wheels, and their position can be adjusted to find the optimal settings.\n\nThe omni-wheels can be rotated in 90<sup>o<\/sup> increments to test for the most effective orientation.\n\nAn electronic fish scale will be used to measure the amount of force needed to pull the apparatus across a table.\n\nThe test is explained in more detail in the [[Band-Beesten rolling drum set#Testing| '''Omni-Wheel\/Ball Caster Friction Testing''']] section below.\n\n|valign=\"top\"

tests.\n\nIt requires three, vertically oriented, double omni-wheels spaced evenly along the upper portion of the ball as well as three single omni-wheels along the under section to provide support.\n\nThe angle of the top tier of omni-wheels is measured at 50<sup>o<\/sup> from the equator of the basketball, while the lower supporting wheels are on the equator.\n\nThe lower omni-wheels are spaced 1\/4 inch from the ball and are only in place as support to prevent the ball from escaping. \n\nAll of the arms are identical, interchangeable, and easy to manufacture in large groups.\n\nThe inner hub contains a bearing that will allow the wheel to rotate toward the most natural orientation.\n\n\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|'''Pros:'''\n::*Lightweight, minimizes material\n::*Easily manufacturable - interchangeable parts\n::*Resists bending from force direction\n::*Bearing reduces stress while turning\n::*Easy to assemble\/disassemble\n::*Operates under heavy

from the table above.\n\nIt was built out of wood and metal brackets, with casters in three corners.\n\nIt should be noted that it is not a perfect hexagonal shape.\n\nThe angle at which the casters are connected is 135<sup>o<\/sup>, while the others are 105<sup>o<\/sup>.\n\nThese angles were chosen to provide optimum step range with a drummer in the center.\n\nThe lower picture is a test of an

apparatus is pulled with the fishing scale to measure the force needed to  move the wheel from a resting position.\n\nThree types of wheels are being tested, single omni-wheels, paired omni-wheels, and ball casters.\n\nThe types will be tested using angles ranging from 40<sup>o<\/sup> up to 55<sup>o<\/sup>, and the omni-wheels will be oriented either vertically or horizontally.\n\nOnce the forces are recorded and the apparatus is weighed, the friction can be calculated for each variation.\n\nFor the full test explanation, see the final report:\n\n[[:File:BandBeesten 2013 OmniBall Final Report.pdf|'''Friction Testing Report''']]\n\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|The test revealed that the friction reduces as the angle rises.\n\nThe best orientation for a final product is with the paired omni-wheels in the horizontal orientation at 50<sup>o<\/sup> from the equator of the basketball.\n\nThis orientation is deemed best as long as there are supporting wheels below the equator to prevent the ball from rolling off of the wheel base.\n\nSee more detailed results below:\n\n[[:File:BandBeesten 2013 OmniWheel Results.pdf|'''Friction Testing Results''']]\n\n|-\n|[[File:IMG

by Dr. Edwin Odom, Professor of Mechanical Engineering, and Dr. Daniel Bukvich, Professor of Percussion and Music Theory. The goal of their collaboration was to create a full drum set that could easily be played and moved easily by a single person during marching band performances. \n\nThe Fall of 2011 marked the beginning research of ideas for what they called the Beest. This acedemic year was solely an experimentation year; For more in depth design details refer to the [http:\/\/seniordesign.engr.uidaho.edu\/2011-2012\/drumroll\/main.html '''Team Drum Roll'''] webpage.\n\nThe design team of 2012-2013 made progress with the BandBeesten's design. Dan Mathewson, a UI graduate student, designed a robotic, power driven front wheel to enable the machine received commands through the operator's body movements. This design made it onto the field and more information on this can be found in Dan Mathewson's thesis. \n\nIn 2013, the design team started designing a new BandBeesten with a sturdier frame. This design relied only on man-power and did not have any assisting motors. The design used was very strong and could hold a full set of drums with ease. more information about this design can be found at \n\n[[#toc|''Return to contents'']]\n\n=='''Design'''==\n===Design Specifications===\n::*Move forward backward, and do 360 degree rotations.\n::*Have a forward speed of 2 mph\n::*Have a reverse speed of 2\/3 mph\n::*Complete a 360 degree rotation in under 2 seconds\n::*Lightweight\/ sturdy design\n::*Able to support ~150 lb\n::*Be able to stay charged during long performances \n\n[[#toc|''Return to contents'']]\n\n===Frame===\n\nThe first generation of the Bandbeesten was a great proof of concept using lightweight aluminum and incorporated few connecting beam, but the minimalistic approach did have flaws. The frame was weak and would flex whenever the user wanted to perform a maneuver.\n\nIn 2013, a solution was found by using a tetrahedron frame. This frame puts every beam within it in either tension or compression, minimizing bending and flexing. Although this frame was very strong, wood was used as a building material making it bulky.\n\nThe latest version of the Bandbeesten combines features of previous generations by using a minimalist aluminum design to minimize weight and a tetrahedron shape to maximize strength.\n\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\"|\n!  style=\"text-align: left;\"|\n!  style=\"text-align: left;\"|\n\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"center\"|[[File:Beesten frame design 2014.png|frameless|center|300px|]]\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|'''Frame Design'''\n\n*Strong tetrahedral shape\n*Aluminum tube construction\n*Lightweight construction\n*Use a simple design that would allow for folding when not in use\n*Drums mounted to one central location\n*Add electric motors to help with maneuvering\n\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"center\"|[[File:BeestenFrame_1.JPG|frameless|center|300px|]]\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|'''Frame Prototype'''\n\n*Strong tetrahedral shape\n*lightweight\n*Wood needs extra support due to weakness when applying pressure across grains\n*Using a weak material in the prototype allows easy observation of stress concentration points \n\n|}\n\n[[#toc|''Return to contents'']]\n\n===Wheels===\n\nThe BandBeesten must be able to be moved in any direction on a moment\u2019s notice to keep up with the marching band\u2019s routine. Its wheels must allow maneuvers such as crab walking and rotation as well as straight motion. Designs considered are Omni-ball wheels, conventional casters, and Omni-wheels.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\"|\n!  style=\"text-align: left;\"|\n!

Thrusters will respond to input from the sub'''\n::* Program will activate the thrusters to execute a task\n==Current Design==\n[[File:2014 robosub Frame Underside.jpg|thumb|left]]\n===Sub Frame===\n[[File:2014 robosub Hull.jpg|thumb|left]]\nThe frame is constructed principally from extruded aluminum beams to which the various other components will be secured. The battery packs and the control system of the sub will be enclosed respectively in two waterproof cylinders. The external sensors and motors of the sub will be attached to the frame. All connections between power, control, and sensors will be done with cables running through through waterproof ports.\n===Thrusters===\nThe sub is outfitted with six thrusters which will be able to control all movement in the xyz plane as well as roll (rotating around forward axis) and pitch\/yaw (incline from fore to aft). The thrusters will be directly controlled by the microcontrollers based on commands sent from the PC.\n===Sensors===\nThe sub is outfitted with numerous sensors including audio (three hydrophones), visual (four cameras), accelerometer, magnetometer (compass), thermometer, depth sensor, gyroscope. All sensors other than visual\/audio, which feed directly into the PC, will be polled by a microcontroller at regular intervals. The microcontroller will create a packet with the sensor reading and device information which will be sent to the PC.\n===Grabbing Arms===\n[[File:2014 robosub Marker Dropper.jpg|thumb|left]]\nThe sub has two grabbing arms, each of which is controlled with a stepper motor; one in front and one on the bottom. The front claw also functions as the marker dropper.  As the marker dropper tasks will be completed before the grabbing tasks, the arm will being at fully open and then as it closes will drop the first and then the second marker before closing fully. By telling the arm to close only a certain amount the dropping of the first and second markers can be controlled.\n===Torpedo Launchers===\n[[File:2014 robosub Pneumatic System.jpg|thumb|left]]\nThe sub has two pneumatically controlled torpedo launchers pointing forward. They are actuated by signals from one of the microcontrollers. The compressed air canister that powers the launchers is situated so that it can be quickly and easily replaced.\n===Control System===\nAll sensor and motor functions within the sub are managed by PIC32 microcontrollers, with the exception of the visual and audio sensors which are fed directly to the PC. The PIC32 polls each sensor in series at times based on timer interrupts, packages the data with an identifying header and sends it to the PC through an I2C connection. The PC processes the data and the AI software identifies which motor commands are required. The command packet is sent to the PIC32s over in I2C bus. The packet contains a header specifying the target devices so that the microcontroller will know where to send it.\n===Movement Module Prototype===\n'''The movement module prototype is required to do the following to be useful to the system that was previously described:'''\n::* Gather key events from a keyboard, including single key events, or a polling event in the case of a continuously held key.\n::* Regulate the amount of events processed and data broadcasted as to not overload the socket communication module with too many requests. This feature is required to share the broadcaster and socket communication with the other parallel executing modules. \n::* Evaluate the appropriate movement logic to execute a maneuver effectively.\n::* Produce the required data to be broadcasted back to the micro-controller which will control the thrusters by providing a values to activate each thruster and the its power level.\n===User Input Movement Module: Tested===\n'''The user input movement module has been rewritten to integrate with the other python modules and the updated architecture.'''\n::* Movement is now handled as X,Y,Z values over three fields: location, orientation, and velocity\n::* The updated architecture has removed the broadcaster and now relies on inter-module communication handled by 0MQ and\na message process called the \"grapevine\" which communicates messages to the new logging module and others.\n::* The new X,Y,Z values are contained within Python dictionaries with the intent of being more friendly to future implementation of automated movement and AI integration.\n<br>\n\n==Team Members==\n{| width=\"100%\" border=\"2\"\n|-\n!

The accumulation of waste is a problem because it can lead to disease and cause other fish health related problems. Fish waste and food particles can accumulate at the bottom of raceways and are easily re-suspended in water by turbulent flow or fish movement. The current method of cleaning fish raceways is a very tedious and slow task that does not clean the raceway 100%. The goal for our project is to successfully create an automatic cleaning system for the raceways that would significantly decrease the human component of cleaning, as well as increase the efficiency of the process and quality of the cleaning.\n\n==Design Goals== \n#Design an automated cleaning system with little maintenance.\n#Reduces fine particulate in raceways from accumulating downstream to increase fish health. \n#Maintains Current Phosphorous levels and Healthy Dissolved Oxygen levels.    \n#Analyses of flow using computational and experimental fluid dynamics. \n==Design Specifications== \n:Our design must accomplish the following\n*Fit within the existing specifications of the raceways (only minor raceway modifications) \n*Be more effective than the current system. \n*Reduce downstream flow of particulates \n**While continuing to produce 5 to 7 cfs of flow in the raceway\n*Stay within EPA regulations of flow and waste\n**Current EPA standards are being researched to provide exact numbers on downstream waste\n\n==Project Learning== \n===Background Research=== \n'''Current Methods''' \n*A push screen that re-suspends particulate from the bottom and sides of the raceway\n[[File:Current Method 1.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Push Screen Method ]]\n*A vacuum that cleans waste once it has reached the quiescent zone \n[[File:Current method 2.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Vacuum System ]]\n'''Baffle Methods'''\n*Increases the flow at the bottom of the raceway to move waste\n*Has been implemented before but due to problems it is not currently in place\n'''Brine Methods''' \n*Injects a solution with a density higher than water and the particulate to float the waste along the bottom to the quiescent zone\n*Has been tested in a controlled environment but never in an actual fish raceway\n===Interviews===\n\n'''Scott Williams, Aquaculture Center'''\n*Scott has previously worked for Clear Springs Inc. and had a vast knowledge of their operations \n*Suggested the baffle idea be our main focus due to simplicity and amount of previously tested ideas with same basic design\n'''Ken Cain, Fisheries Immunologist''' \n*Ken has also previously worked for Clear Springs Inc. \n*Suggested we move away from baffle idea because it has been tried many times and has never been successfully implemented \n*Confirmed that the introduction of a brine solution will not harm fish, but will actually help to kill bacteria in fish gills and scales. We will however have to test the brine method with fish in order to determine the effect fish movement has on brine solution at the bottom of the raceway.\n\n''' Jim Liou, Hydraulic Engineer''' \n*Provided brine solution research and method\n*Has previously used the brine solution method in a controlled environment (without fish)to test how it works as a waste removal system\n\n==Visit to Clear Springs== \n:On November 23rd our design team visited the Clear Springs facility in Buhl, ID. They gave us a tour while we asked questions and discussed design parameters and options. They're facility is primarily a food stock farm (producing fish primarily for food purposes) but it also has a few brude stock (spawning) operations.\n*Important design restraints gathered from the trip: \n**The flow in each raceway is roughly 7 cfs, it cannot drop to below than 5 cfs or fish in the downstream raceways will start to die \n**Current QZ zones are cleaned 1\/3 at a time and the water from the cleaning goes into an 8 in. pipe and is transported to a settling lagoon from there \n**The furthest upstream raceway is the most sensitive to flow change because it has the youngest fish \n**Automated cleaning design would be most effective if it were portable from raceway to raceway, rather than a model being built for each individual raceway \n**Cost is the number 1 deciding factor \n\n*They seemed most interested in our baffle idea because: \n**Ease of use \n**Low cost \n**No modifications to the raceway required \n**Possibility for adjustments and easy maintenance \n*Their thoughts on the movable pump design:\n** More effective at cleaning than the baffle \n**Would require installation of equipment inside of the raceway \n**Outflow would have to be carefully monitored to maintain adequate flow in the raceway \n**Could tie into the 8 inch drainage pipe already in place \n**Potentially more costly but could clean more effectively and require less man hours than baffle\n\n==Concept Development==\n===Baffle Method===\n*Have tested a simple baffle design in our small flume \n*Exploring several new designs \n**Multiple baffles \n**Baffle with diffuser \n**Movable baffle \n*This option is our first priority because of its ease of use, cost effectiveness and overall portability \n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Baffle Systems\n!

The goal for out project is to succesfully create an automatic cleaning system for the raceways that would significantly decrease the human component of cleaning, as well as increase the quality of the process. \n==Sponsor== \n:Clear Springs Inc. of Idaho is the sponsor of this project. Clear Springs Inc. raises primarily Rainbow trout for food products. The have several hatchery farm locations throughout Idaho, but we are focusing specifically on their Box Canyon Farm location near Twin Falls Idaho. This hatchery has 180 fish rearing ponds. \n[[File:Box Canyon Farms.jpg|thumb|Left|400px|Box Canyon Farms ]]\n::[http:\/\/www.clearsprings.com Clear Springs Inc.]\n==Team Members== \n*Jeremy Schroeder\n*Levi Dawes \n*Matt Francis \n*Kate Wicher \n*Tao Xing, Advisor\n*Jeremy Cuddihy, Mentor \n==Design Goals== \n#Design an automated cleaning system with little maintenance.\n#Reduces fine particulate in raceways from accumulating downstream to increase fish health. \n#Maintains Current Phosphorous levels and Healthy Dissolved Oxygen levels.    \n#Analyses of flow using computational and experimental fluid dynamics. \n==Design Specifications== \n:Our design must accomplish the following\n*Fit within the existing specifications of the raceways (only minor raceway modifications) \n*Be more effective than the current system. \n*Reduce downstream flow of particulates \n*Stay within EPA regulations of flow and waste \n==Project Learning== \n===Background Research=== \n====Current Methods==== \n*A push screen that re-suspends particulate from the bottom and sides of the raceway\n[[File:Current Method 1.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Push Screen Method ]]\n*A vacuum that cleans waste once it has reached the quiescent zone \n[[File:Current method 2.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Vacuum System ]]\n====Baffle Methods====\n*Increases the flow at the bottom of the raceway to move waste\n*Has been implemented before but due to problems it is not currently in place\n====Brine Methods==== \n*Injects a solution with a density higher than water and the particulate to float the waste along the bottom to the quiescent zone\n*Has been tested in a controlled environment but never in an actual fish raceway\n====Interviews====\n=====Scott Williams, Aquaculture Center=====\n*Scott has previously worked for Clear Springs Inc. and had a vast knowledge of their operations \n*Suggested the baffle idea be our main focus due to simplicity and amount of previously tested ideas with same basic design\n=====Ken Cain, Fisheries Immunologist===== \n*Ken has also previously worked for Clear Springs Inc. \n*Suggested we move away from baffle idea because it has been tried many times and has never been successfully implemented \n*Confirmed that the introduction of a brine solution will not harm fish, but will actually help to kill bacteria in fish gills and scales.

Our user-friendly design allows for precise control of Idaho's Flywheel Energy Storage System. Additionally, it provides intuitive monitoring of the Flywheel's performance.\n\n=== Implementation ===\nThe GUI is written using the QT Framework. This allows for rapid development while being flexible. The interface's primary target operating system is Microsoft Windows, however QT is multi-platform allowing for expanded operating system support in the future. The QT serial library will be used to communicate with the Flywheel's primary microcontroller facilitating control and monitoring of the Flywheel's operating parameters.\n\n=== Testing ===\nTo be filled once this step has been reached.\n\n== Design ==\n\n=== Mockups ===\n===== Dashboard =====\n[[File:2016_dashboard_mockup_flycam.jpg|700px]]\n\n===== Settings =====\n[[File:2016_settings_mockup_flycam.jpg|700px]]\n\n=== Prototypes ===\n==== Dashboard ====\n[[File:2016-03-28-dashboard.png|700px]]\n\n==== Settings ====\n[[File:2016-03-28-settings.png|700px]]\n\n== Timeline ==\n\n=== March ===\n* Add Timeline deadlines here as created.\n\n=== April ===\n* Add Timeline deadlines here as created.\n\n\n== Team Information ==\n\n=== FlyCam Members Group Photo ===\n[[File:2016_FIGs_Team_Photo.jpg|700px]]\n\nMembers:  Eric Silk, Ben Bolton, Jesse Jutson, Thomas Hagen\n\n=== Biography ===\n{| width=\"100%\" border=\"2\"\n|-\n!

Our Logan lathes were acquired in 1960. They are due for replacement when funds become available. New lathes would have variable speed spindles and digital readout systems.<ref>Russ Porter<\/ref>\n\n==Anatomy==\n[[File:Full Anatomy of Logan 6561 Lathe.png|400px|thumb|Component Callout, see text to left for detailed description]]\nThere are many types of lathes, some with more components than others, but they all have a headstock, tailstock, and carriage.\n\n===Headstock===\nThe main part of the lathe is referred to as the headstock which typically includes a spindle and drive plate, high and low speed selector(s) [[Changing Between High and Low Speeds (Manual Lathe)|(See: Changing Between High and Low Speeds)]], spindle speed selector [[Changing Speed (Manual Lathe)|(See: Changing speed of manual lathe)]] and tapping\/power feed speed controls [[Changing Tapping and Power Feed Speed (Manual Lathe)|(See: Changing Tapping and Power Feed Speed)]]. A chuck, which holds the working material, is attached to the drive plate.\n\n====Chuck====\nThere are three main types of chucks used on a lathe. A three jaw chuck which is the most common and most often used because of its ability to clamp material quickly. Most lathes will have three jaw chucks in at least two sizes, a larger size for everyday use and a smaller high speed chuck which is capable of higher speeds. The second type of chuck is a four jaw chuck. Four jaw chucks are used for the holding of non-round material, and non-concentric turning. Unlike a three jaw chuck, all four jaws are adjusted independently, and such a dial indicator must be used when chucking material [[Four Jaw Chuck|(See: Zeroing Parts in Four Jaw Chuck)]]. The third type of chuck is a collet chuck. Collet chucks are used when greater contact area is need for holding the part, as well as having the advantages of quicker chucking when producing multiple copies of the same part. For more information on chucks, see [[Swapping Lathe Chuck]]\n\n\n{| style=\"width:50%;\"\n|-\n| [[File:3-Jaw-chuck.png|thumb|Three Jaw Chuck]]\n| [[File:4-Jaw-chuck.png|thumb|Four Jaw Chuck]]\n| [[File:Collet Chuck.jpg|thumb|Collet Chuck]]\n|}\n[[File:Detail Anatomy of Logan 6561 Lathe.png|400px|thumb|Component Callout, see text to left for detailed description]]\n====Jaws====\nThere are two main types of jaws, the standard jaw, and the soft jaw. Standard jaws typically have a 'wide side' used for general purpose turning which provide a large clamping surface over a wide diameter range. The jaws often can be removed and reinserted backwards so that the 'stepped side' of the jaw is facing inwards. While this is true of the CNC HAAS, the Logan's have a second set of jaws, kept in the cabinet. Soft jaws start out as aluminum blanks that can be machined to an exact diameter to result in excellent contact surface with reduced possibility of marking parts. While soft jaws require more setup time their advantages can be critical.\n\n===Tailstock===\nThe tailstock is an assembly which is capable in moving in the z direction and is typically composed of a telescoping shaft which accepts tapered collets, a lock handle to fix the position, and a handle for actuation. The tailstock is commonly used for drilling operations, as well as holding long work pieces for stabilization purposes in a live\/dead center.\n\n===Carriage===\nThe carriage is the primary means of working on a lathe and is typically comprised of the cross feed, x-feed, threading dial indicator, threading controls [[Cutting Threads (Manual Lathe)| (See: Cutting Threads on a Manual Lathe)]], power feed controls [[Use of Power Controls (Manual Lathe)|(See: Using the Power Controls)]], a tool changer [[Changing Tools (Lathes)|(See: Changing Lathe Tools)]].\n<br\\>\n<br\\>\n<br\\>\n<br\\>\n<br\\>\n<br\\>\n\n==Overview of Lathe Tools==\n[[File:Lathe Operations.png|400px|right|Types of operations]]\nPut below into a table (with links if necessary:\n*Boring Bar\n*Face off tool\n*Parting tool\n*Turning tool\n*Threading tools\n*Radius Tools\n*what else?\n\n==Lathe Changeovers==\n*[[Swapping_Lathe_Chuck|Changing the chuck]]\n*Adjusting speed (including low and high gears)\n*Setup for power feed and threads\n*Using the magnetic dial indicators\n*Use of tailstock\n\n==References==\n<references\/>\n\n[[Category:Machine_Shop_(General)]]","timestamp":"20130612011522","user-timestamp":"20130517000614","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Manual_mill_(Sharp)","comment":"Created page with \"{{WIP}} This is the wiki page dedicated to the Sharp manual mills.

An isolated subspecies in the Columbia River Basin is listed as endangered by the United States.<ref>Pygmy rabbit - Wikipedia[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pygmy_rabbit]<\/ref>. The burrowing owls of North America, who raise their young in burrows dug by other animals<ref>Burrowing Owl - Wikipedia[https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Burrowing_owl]<\/ref>, are also of interest to researchers at the University of Idaho.\nCurrent methods for exploring burrows are either ineffective or invasive, with the leading tool for exploration being a camera attached to a single flexible rod. This limits the type of structures the device can enter and the depth it can reach.\nThe goal of this project is to design and build a device that can enter a burrow to collect video, volume measurements, and a 3D map of the structure.\nThe current iteration of the project aims to write a software interface for controlling the vehicle designed in 2014-15 and collecting data.\n\n\n\n\n==Problem Definition==\n\n===Background=== \n     \nThe pygmy rabbit digs burrows into the ground, which help to keep it safe from predators and the cold winters of its environment. These burrows are important to the pygmy rabbit, but they are also very important to the local ecosystem. The burrows are often used as shelter for other animals who cannot dig their own burrows. They also have an impact on soil density, temperature and water retention, which impacts surrounding plant life.\n\nThe pygmy rabbit has a very strong impact on the plants and animals of its environment, and as such is important to study. Some important data on the rabbit burrows is presented below:\n\n* Burrow diameter between three and eighteen inches\n* On average, each burrow has between three and five entrances, with an expected maximum of fourteen entrances\n* Each burrow is between a meter and one and one-half meters under ground\n* Each burrow entrance will be between two and three meters away from other entrances\n\nThe Burrowing Owls utilize much simpler structures that often consist of a single entrance and a lower expected depth.\n\n===2014 Vehicle Specifications===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

This could pose a problem for burrows up to 18in. (46cm) wide or at junctions.\n* The computer in the vehicle has a 454 MHz ARM processor and 64 MB of RAM.\n* The following hardware items had not yet been addressed and were included on the \"To-Do\" List given us:\n** Mount LED light source\n** Construct a durable, keyed tether for burrow exploration\n** Attach accelerometer\n** Mount range finder array\n** Purchase a connector for battery charging\n** Wire in begin and stop recording commands, utilizing the existing button on the DVR\n** Identify the correct camera failure modes\n** Install an external power switch.\n* In addition, we noted that the forward camera was not wired to anything.\n* The following software items were included on the \"To-Do\" List:\n** Create a comprehensive user interface\n** Write code for sensor data storage\n** Implement a method to create a 3D map from points obtained by sensor readings\n** Implement a method for estimating burrow volume\n* The file \"Tech Presentation Final\" suggests black and white 640x480 video is captured, whereas the wiki indicated 1280x720 video.\n* Battery recharges in about 1.5 hours from \"almost any power source\", though it's not clear what that means, since the \"To-Do\" List included purchasing an adapter for charging.\n* The existing C code included the following keyboard commands for controlling the vehicle, which certainly don't satisfy the requirement for a simple interface:\n** 'w', 'a', 's', and 'd' to move forward, turn left, move back, and turn right (all at half speed)\n** 'u' and 'h' to veer left and right (at half speed)\n** 'l' and 'h' for veering backwards (at half speed)\n** Capital letter equivalents for full speed\n** 'Y' to stop\n\n===Range Sensor Analysis===\n'''Objective:'''\nDetermine the accuracy and maximum range that can be expected from the range sensors purchased by the 2014-15 team.\n\n'''Methodology:'''\nUsing surfaces or varying reflectance, plot true values of distance between a sensor and the surface against the measured values returned by the sensor.\n\n'''Findings and Analysis:'''\n[[File:2015_RabMap_RangeSensorPerformance.png|400px|thumb|Range Sensor Performance]]\nThe observed maximum sensor range was about 15cm. In cases where a burrow is 18in. (46cm) wide, this will still not reach halfway across the tunnel. However, this is significantly better than the 10cm. range suggested by the specifications from the vendor. The small maximum range may still negatively impact the vehicle's ability to create maps and estimate burrow volume. The minimum accurate range appears to be 1cm. This should be acceptable most of the time, since only some portions of the burrows should be so small that the vehicle can barely traverse through them. Additionally, the error at distances that small should not significantly impact the relative error of volume estimates. In nearly all cases, the observed error was less than 1cm, and was much lower for surfaces of higher reflectance. While this could pose problems in a dirt environment, the error is fairly marginal.\n\n==Design==\n\n==Personnel Information==\n===Team Members===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" border=\"2\"\n!

The motors will be new in that she is using linear induction motors as the wheel as well as the drive system which will be much more efficient. However because the only rotation part of the motor is the rim, it makes braking and connecting the motor to the car difficult.<br>\nThe electrical engineers on our team are working on a regenerative braking system as well as a battery charging system for the vehicle.\nBoth from a mechanical and electrical standpoint we must be able to design an build a testing apparatus for the motors.\n\n===Linear Induction Motor:===\n[[File:LinearInductionMotor.png|thumb|right|Linear Induction Motor Dimensions]]\n* Rotating rim called the rotor\n* Static center called the stator made of laminated metal plates with fins and wire coils wrapped around the fins\n* Projected speed (straight line) - 35mph\n* Projected power - 25lb\n* The rim is projected to fit a 14in tire size\n\n====How it works:====\nThis motor is not much different than a simple Induction motor. There are multiple coils around the stator that take alternating currents that make a magnetic field that 'pulls' the rotor around the stator<br>\n\n==Design Objectives:==\n* Mechanical Braking\n** The vehicle must be able to stop the vehicle in a reasonable amount of time\n** The brakes should not add too much weight to the wheel\n* Regenerative Charging\n** The motors should be able to act as generators to save energy as the vehicle is braked electrically \n* Wheel Attachments\n** The wheel attachments should be able to take the force of the motors as well as the weight of the vehicle\n** The wheel attachments should be easy to attach to a test apparatus as well as the suspension of the vehicle\n** The rim of the wheel should be removable to accommodate for wet or dry tires at competition\n==Design Ideas==\n\n\n# Mechanical Braking [[File:Rpdchrge.png|thumb|right|Rapid charging Circuit]]\n## Perimeter disc brakes\n## 'Outside' brake disc\n## Inverted brake caliper\n# Rapid Charging [[File:Regen control flow.png|thumb|right|Regenerator Control Flow Chart]]\n#* Three types of charges used\n#** Type1 - 120V AC (regular wall socket)\n#** Type2 - 220V AC (washer\/dryer socket)\n#** Type3 - 480V DC \n# Regenerative Breaking\n#* Recover the kinetic energy lost during breaking\n#* Recharge the batteries with the energy recovered\n#* Ultra-Capacitor bank\n#** Store the recovered energy before supplying to the batteries(if necessary)\n# Wheel Center\n#* Attach directly to the stator\n#* Make it so an upright can attach to the center of the wheel center\n#* Make a mounting point for the brake caliper\n\n==Design Models==\n* Wheel Center attachment [[File:Wheel center attachment.png|thumb|right|Wheel center attachment to the stator]]\n** The stator is the fixed part of the motor and hence the wheel center is attached to the stator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Inverted Brakes [[File:Brakes.png|thumb|right|Perimeter Brake concept]]\n** The disc (perimeter) brakes are inverted and attached to the wheel. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Full Assembly [[File:Full assembly.png|thumb|right|Full assembly concept]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n==Other Information==\nThe Formula Electric Vehicle (EV) is a new project that is currently in the design phase.

There were faster installation times during our experiments from the pound in wedge shape and the screw shape. However, neither of these designs seemed like they would work well. The screw shapes main issue was turning up the soil around the case which wouldn't work well for the probes going into normally packed untouched soil. The wedge shape\u2019s main issue was isolating the internal components from the force of being pounded in. After pounding in a wooden analogue to the case we realized that we were going to have to hit it too hard to keep from breaking it. Another issue with the wedge was not knowing how it affected the soil around it after it was pounded into the ground.\n \n\nWith the dig and place method chosen for the method of installation we then decided that the round cylinder shape for the outer case was the logical choice. With this choice the user would be able to use an auger or a post-hole digger to make a round hole to easily install the probe. Also, using a round digger with a non-round hole would make probe installation difficult.","timestamp":"20130730184320","user-timestamp":"20130530173611","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Outside_Micrometer","comment":"Created page with \"==Description==  ==Definition==  ==Location==  ==Function==  ==Step-by-Step Use==  ==Tips==\"","content":"==Description==\n\n==Definition==\n\n==Location==\n\n==Function==\n\n==Step-by-Step Use==\n\n==Tips==","timestamp":"20150531012928","user-timestamp":"20150531011525","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"P.E.R.C.H.","comment":"I don't know what this is","content":"Introduction:","timestamp":"20131024214721","user-timestamp":"20131024214234","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Pantheon","comment":"Created page with \"[pantheondesignproject.wordpress.com]\"","content":"[pantheondesignproject.wordpress.com]","timestamp":"20131029232508","user-timestamp":"20131024182401","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Pantheon_Project","comment":"Created page with \"[pantheondesignproject.wordpress.com]\"","content":"[pantheondesignproject.wordpress.com]","timestamp":"20131028061333","user-timestamp":"20131024182401","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Parallels","comment":"Created page with \"==Purpose:== The main purpose of the parallels is to ensure that the work-piece is well exposed to allow smooth working of the machine and without damaging the machine.

Thrusters will respond to input from the sub'''\n::* Program will activate the thrusters to execute a task\n==Current Design==\n[[File:2014 robosub Frame Underside.jpg|thumb|left]]\n===Sub Frame===\n[[File:2014 robosub Hull.jpg|thumb|left]]\nThe frame is constructed principally from extruded aluminum beams to which the various other components will be secured. The battery packs and the control system of the sub will be enclosed respectively in two waterproof cylinders. The external sensors and motors of the sub will be attached to the frame. All connections between power, control, and sensors will be done with cables running through through waterproof ports.\n===Thrusters===\nThe sub is outfitted with six thrusters which will be able to control all movement in the xyz plane as well as roll (rotating around forward axis) and pitch\/yaw (incline from fore to aft). The thrusters will be directly controlled by the microcontrollers based on commands sent from the PC.\n===Sensors===\nThe sub is outfitted with numerous sensors including audio (three hydrophones), visual (four cameras), accelerometer, magnetometer (compass), thermometer, depth sensor, gyroscope. All sensors other than visual\/audio, which feed directly into the PC, will be polled by a microcontroller at regular intervals. The microcontroller will create a packet with the sensor reading and device information which will be sent to the PC.\n===Grabbing Arms===\n[[File:2014 robosub Marker Dropper.jpg|thumb|left]]\nThe sub has two grabbing arms, each of which is controlled with a stepper motor; one in front and one on the bottom. The front claw also functions as the marker dropper.  As the marker dropper tasks will be completed before the grabbing tasks, the arm will being at fully open and then as it closes will drop the first and then the second marker before closing fully. By telling the arm to close only a certain amount the dropping of the first and second markers can be controlled.\n===Torpedo Launchers===\n[[File:2014 robosub Pneumatic System.jpg|thumb|left]]\nThe sub has two pneumatically controlled torpedo launchers pointing forward. They are actuated by signals from one of the microcontrollers. The compressed air canister that powers the launchers is situated so that it can be quickly and easily replaced.\n===Control System===\nAll sensor and motor functions within the sub are managed by PIC32 microcontrollers, with the exception of the visual and audio sensors which are fed directly to the PC. The PIC32 polls each sensor in series at times based on timer interrupts, packages the data with an identifying header and sends it to the PC through an I2C connection. The PC processes the data and the AI software identifies which motor commands are required. The command packet is sent to the PIC32s over in I2C bus. The packet contains a header specifying the target devices so that the microcontroller will know where to send it.\n===Movement Module Prototype===\n'''The movement module prototype is required to do the following to be useful to the system that was previously described:'''\n::* Gather key events from a keyboard, including single key events, or a polling event in the case of a continuously held key.\n::* Regulate the amount of events processed and data broadcasted as to not overload the socket communication module with too many requests. This feature is required to share the broadcaster and socket communication with the other parallel executing modules. \n::* Evaluate the appropriate movement logic to execute a maneuver effectively.\n::* Produce the required data to be broadcasted back to the micro-controller which will control the thrusters by providing a values to activate each thruster and the its power level.\n===User Input Movement Module: Tested===\n'''The user input movement module has been rewritten to integrate with the other python modules and the updated architecture.'''\n::* Movement is now handled as X,Y,Z values over three fields: location, orientation, and velocity\n::* The updated architecture has removed the broadcaster and now relies on inter-module communication handled by 0MQ and\na message process called the \"grapevine\" which communicates messages to the new logging module and others.\n::* The new X,Y,Z values are contained within Python dictionaries with the intent of being more friendly to future implementation of automated movement and AI integration.\n<br>\n\n==Team Members==\n{| width=\"100%\" border=\"2\"\n|-\n!

Lawyers are legal officers. A lawyer, after hurdling the bar and therefore utilizing the oath and become licensed are officers from the court. They are part of the privileged few that are eligible to represent complaintant in court also to the magistrate or juries.      <br><br>- They bring with them a great deal of experience. This is somehow linked to the preceding point. Since the lawyers have dealt with many accident cases of various kinds, they will know how to execute negotiations to enable you to have the appropriate reimbursements you deserve. Through their successes and failures, accident lawyers can produce effective means of negotiations to ensure that the clientele get compensated well.<br><br><br><br><br>1. Don't hire the incorrect lawyer. The lawyer you hire is really a tremendous difference. Use good sense in the selection process. Be observant, seek advice, and do not hire an attorney should you not be ok with your interaction with him or her. Here are some circumstances to consider in the initial choosing a lawyer: 1) does the lawyer have a very direct dial phone number? You can believe that when you have to move through a secretary or paralegal to achieve your lawyer, you will have a very harder time reaching him or her; 2) look for a cluttered office; in the event the lawyer is disorganized you are able to assume your case is going to be disorganized. If you see other clients' documents sitting in public view, you'll be able to are aware that your documents will soon be sitting outside in public the same way; 3) guarantee the lawyer features a written client agreement that ensures that you recognize your fees, rights and obligations; 4) don't hire the dabbler - someone who does a traffic ticket case in the morning, an actual estate closing inside afternoon and squeezes your case in somewhere inside middle; divorce is complicated enough that you need to bring in help would you it all day long, daily; and, 5) don't hire an attorney taking on more cases than s\/he are prepared for; ask the lawyer what her or his average caseload is. Handling more than 15 or 20 cases at one time causes most lawyers to get overwhelmed and ineffective. Thinking about these complaints whenever you talk with a lawyer the first time will allow you to increase the risk for right choice.","timestamp":"20140217130512","user-timestamp":"20140217130504","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"RSTP","comment":"Created page with \"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Spanning_Tree_Protocol\"","content":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Spanning_Tree_Protocol","timestamp":"20150310075919","user-timestamp":"20150303234605","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Rain_Gauge_Retrofit","comment":"Created page with \"The rain gauge retrofit entails modifying current rain gauges throughout the northwest to store data in electronic form, saving time and money for the US forest service.   ==P...\"","content":"The rain gauge retrofit entails modifying current rain gauges throughout the northwest to store data in electronic form, saving time and money for the US forest service. \n\n==Problem Definition==\n\n===Background===\n\n===Deliverables===\n\n===Specifications===\n\n==Project Learning==\n\n==Team Information==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color:3D3D3D; background: #FFFFFF\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|[[File:2014_teamname_pic1.jpg|150px|center]]\n|-\n|''' ''Team Member 1'' '''\n|rowspan=\"4\"|''Interests:'' \n\n''Life Goals:'' \n|-\n|''Mechanical Engineering Student''\n|-\n|Hometown: Oregon\n|-\n|Email: member1@vandals.uidaho.edu\n|- \n|rowspan=\"5\"|[[File:2014_teamname_pic2.png|150px|center]]\n|-\n|''' ''Member 2'' '''\n|rowspan=\"4\"|''Interests:''\n\n\n''Life Goals:'' \n|-\n|''Computer Engineering Student''\n|-\n|Hometown: Montana\n|-\n|Email: member2.uidaho.edu\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|[[File:2014_teamname_pic3.png|150px|center]]\n|''' ''Member 3'' '''\n|rowspan=\"4\"|''Interests:''\n\n\n''Life Goals:''\n|-\n|''Biological Systems Engineering Student''\n|-\n|Hometown: Wyoming\n|-\n|Email: member3@vandals.uidaho.edu\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|[[File:2014_teamname_pic4.jpg|150px|center]]\n|-\n|''' ''Student'' '''\n|rowspan=\"4\"|''Interests:'' \n\n\n''Life Goals:'' \n|-\n|''Biological Systems Engineering Student''\n|-\n|Hometown: Washington\n|-\n|Email: member4@vandals.uidaho.edu\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|[[File:2014_teamname_pic5.jpg|150px|center]]\n|''' ''Student's Name'' '''\n|rowspan=\"4\"|''Interests:'' \n\n\n''Life Goals:''\n|-\n|''Mechanical Engineering Student''\n|-\n|Hometown: Idaho\n|-\n|Email: member5@vandals.uidaho.edu  \n|}\n\n==Document Archive==","timestamp":"20141007225759","user-timestamp":"20141007223738","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Reamers","comment":"Created page with \"'''Reamers''' [[File:Reamer1.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Image of gray shop toolbox.|Gray Shop Toolbox]]   ==Purpose==\"","content":"'''Reamers'''\n[[File:Reamer1.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Image of gray shop toolbox.|Gray Shop Toolbox]]\n\n\n==Purpose==","timestamp":"20140603042623","user-timestamp":"20140527174826","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Rehabilitation_Training_Software","comment":"Created page with \"Our team is creating additional training games\/simulations for the Arm Assist rehabilitation hardware from Tecnalia.

The pre-existing rain catchment system is the primary water source and potentially contains pathogens and sediments that could be harmful to human health. Currently, the orphanages do not have filtration or disinfection devices to protect against these contaminants. \n\n[[File:logoH2Orpahns.png|600px|thumb|right|H2Orpahns and Orphans to Ambassadors]]\n\n== Sponsor Background ==\nOrphans to Ambassadors is working with multiple orphanages in developing countries to build a long term solution to address the lack of clean drinking water available at children\u2019s homes and orphanages. The organization has begun building the first generation solar powered water filtration system in which a small 12 volt pump (powered by 60 watt solar panel) pulls water from a holding container and pushes the water through a basic carbon filter and into a storage tank for cooking and drinking.\nOur job as a team is to improve the current system to meet the World Heath Organizations criteria for clean drinking water.

Not only do the technology, education, and practices give children cleaner water and food, brighter and safer energy, and more free time to be kids, we\u2019re also creating renewable foundations in developing countries where any growth means more technology: the cleaner now the better tomorrow.\n<\/blockquote>\n[http:\/\/www.who.int\/water_sanitation_health\/dwq\/en\/ Orphans to Ambassadors]\n\n== Our Team ==\n<!--[[File:TeamPic.jpg|300px|thumb|right|TeamPic]]-->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

We found that this system would not only best meet the needs of our client, but would provide clean water that fit in a low maintenance, durable, and sustainable package.  \n\nCurrently our team has specked the filtration components, pump, battery and flow meter as linked below.

It will also help make the finish look much better instead of the jaws making a mark on it.}}\n|}","timestamp":"20140601205330","user-timestamp":"20140601201946","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Switching_LiPo_Battery_Charger","comment":"Created page with \"{|{{InfoboxBegin  |image=294732-battery charge control dedicated ics or microcontrollers image.jpg|thumb|caption }} {{InfoboxEntry  |title = Sponsor  |content =  <ul> <li>[htt...\"","content":"{|{{InfoboxBegin\n |image=294732-battery charge control dedicated ics or microcontrollers image.jpg|thumb|caption\n}}\n{{InfoboxEntry\n |title = Sponsor\n |content = \n<ul>\n<li>[http:\/\/www2.cs.uidaho.edu\/~rinker\/ Robert Rinker]<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n}}\n{{InfoboxEntry\n |title = Team Name\n |content =       Trip C\n}}\n{{InfoboxEntry\n |title = Duration\n |content =       Spring 2014 - Fall 2014\n}}\n{{InfoboxEntry\n |title = Faculty Instructor\n |content =\n<ul>\n<li>[http:\/\/www.uidaho.edu\/engr\/ece\/faculty\/feng-li\/ Dr. Feng Li]<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n}}\n{{InfoboxEntry\n |title = Faculty Advisor\n |content = \n<ul>\n<li>[http:\/\/www.ece.uidaho.edu\/ee\/power\/hhess\/ Dr. Herbert Hess]<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n}}\n{{InfoboxEntry\n |title = Faculty Mentor\n |content =\n<ul>\n<li>[http:\/\/www.uidaho.edu\/engr\/ece\/faculty\/santora\/ Dr. Michael Santora]<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n}}\n{{InfoboxEntry\n |title = Team Members\n |content = \n<ul>\n<li>Ryler Adams<\/li>\n<li>Pankaj Dhyani<\/li>\n<li>Abraham Martinez<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n}}\n|}\n\nThe University of Idaho Marching Band has been incorporating multimedia displays into their performances, including synchronized light emitting diodes powered by Lithium-Polymer battery packs. There is a need for a charging system capable of charging approximately 200 packs safely and efficiently within a one week time frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n==Problem Definition==\n===Background===\n[[File:T800-3-20.jpg|thumb|left|Turnigy 800mAh 3S 20C Lipo Pack]]\n;The Lithium-Ion Battery\n:Minimum Capacity: 800mAh\n:Configuration: 3S1P\/11.1v\/3cell\n:Constant Discharge: 20C\n:Peak Discharge(10sec): 30C\n:Pack Weight: 75g\n:Pack Size: 57x29x23mm\n:Charge Plug: JST-XH<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nA device which can switch between multiple lithium polymer batteries after charge completion of a single battery and hence charges in a sequence is required by the University of Idaho marching band.Automatic switching of the batteries during the charging process requires less user interface and the circuitry to design the aforementioned device is one that can be achieved under a moderate budget. The prototype and the circuitry can be multiplied and extended as the number of batteries to be charged increases and further improvement of the circuit can also reduce costs.\n\n===Problem Statement===\nA robust lithium polymer battery charger that requires less user interface is desired for charging batteries used in the light show produced by the University of Idaho marching band. The prototype required should charge 10 batteries in a day and thus 50 batteries in a week. In future iterations of the project a system containing four of the prototypes modules can be connected in parallel to charge 40 batteries in a day and hence 200 batteries in a week .\n\n===Specifications===\nMarketing specifications:\n* 200 batteries need to be charged per week.\n* Should be user friendly and require minimum amount of interfacing during or after charging.\n* The device should be scalable so that the prototype could be multiplied or added to charge more batteries in future iterations i.e. a modular system.\n* The charging status should be indicated to the user.\n\nEngineering Specifications:\n* Since 200 batteries needs to be charged per business week, a battery matrix system (charging multiple batteries or charging in sequence through a single board) needs to be formulated. Charging circuit for parallel (simultaneously) or series (charging 1 battery then switching to the next in series) needs to be devised.\n* For minimum interfacing, a control system needs to be integrated within the design that controls the voltage and current flow to the batteries. Possible microcontroller programming required.\n* The rows and column number of the battery matrix will decide the number of batteries to be charged, parallel or serial charging and the amount of interfacing required. The number of batteries being charged per 2 hrs. (Approx. charging rate for a single battery) or over a course of a day or a week needs to be analyzed to allow the client minimum interfacing but good results. \n\nDesign Specifications:\n* A battery matrix of 10 X 1 was decided. The design will charge one battery at a time and switch to the next one in the column as          soon as the microcontroller senses a voltage change. Hence the design will charge 10 batteries in roughly 20 hours and 40 batteries in the same time if 4 modules of the design are used and connected in parallel to a power supply. Thus, it will charge 200 batteries\/business week. This matrix was selected since it will require minimum interfacing from the user as 40 batteries have to be connected once and removed by the end of the day rather than charging 10 batteries in parallel, that will require plugging the batteries in and out after every 2 hours. The single evaluation board circuit (single IC) will be used to charge and will switch to the next battery in the column through a switching circuit consisting of a Solid State Relay (TLP3100) and controlled by a microcontroller.\n* Arduino Uno was selected because of it\u2019s small size and a list of important functions (required for the project) that it could implement. \n* For charging 200 batteries per week, four of the PCB boards (10 X 1 matrix per board) connected in parallel to a power supply can be used. The whole modular system will charge 40 batteries per day hence 200 batteries per week. A single PCB board will be designed and made while the modular system is left for future senior design teams to finish.\n\n==Design==\n===Selections===\n[[File:Photo (2).JPG|thumb|right|ti bq241xx (bqSWITCHER) Evaluation Module]]\n====Evaluation Charging Circuit====\nThe ti bq241xx (bqSWITCHER) evaluation module delivers a suitable technique for evaluating a charging management solution for portable applications. The evaluation module used incorporates the ti bq24115 IC which fulfills the capacity of charging more than three battery cells in series safely and efficiently. The evaluation module for the bq24115 chip is default set to charge one battery cell, but by using the voltage output regulation formula, provided by the integrated circuit's datasheet, one can find the modifiable resistance across two nodes on the module and is able to configure up to three battery cells in series (~12v). By evaluating and observing the module, the constant current and constant voltage characteristics become apparent when testing. First the voltage begins to rise and current is constant. Once the voltage reaches maximum voltage the current decreases to prevent the battery from creating too much pressure inside possibly initiating a fire. Current drops to zero and voltage falls slightly due to charge termination. An occasional topping charge can be applied to top off the charge.\n====Microcontroller====\nThe Arduino Uno Revison 3 microcontroller board was selected according to desired criteria such as the suitable size, suitable memory, sufficient analog & digital input\/output, and large product support. The Arduino Uno R3 is a simple yet robust microcontroller that is based off the Atmega328 processor.\n\nSummary\n\nMicrocontroller                        ATmega328<br>\nOperating Voltage                    5V<br>\nInput Voltage (recommended)\t7-12V<br>\nInput Voltage (limits)         \t6-20V<br>\nDigital I\/O Pins\t                        14 (of which 6 provide PWM output)<br>\nAnalog Input Pins\t                6<br>\nDC Current per I\/O Pin\t        40 mA<br>\nDC Current for 3.3V Pin\t        50 mA<br>\nFlash Memory\t                        32 KB (ATmega328) of which 0.5 KB used by bootloader<br>\nSRAM\t                                2 KB (ATmega328)<br>\nEEPROM\t                                1 KB (ATmega328)<br>\nClock Speed\t                        16 MHz<br>\n\n====Relay====\n\n===Detailed Design===\n====Design Schematic====\n[[File:PCB_Schematic.PNG|1000px|thumb|center| PCB Schematic]]\n\n===Implementation===\n====PCB Design====\nA PCB was designed that includes the evaluation charging circuit, relays and battery connections.

We decided that the technology in virtual reality was not quite complete enough yet and a 40\" touchscreen was too small and didn't deliver enough of a \"WOW\" factor.  Instead we settled on something we think will match the aesthetic of the Think Tank which is just around the corner from the hallway where our display will be placed.\n\nThe design we chose is to project our UI onto a large glass pane from behind.  This will give the illusion of the glass being the object displaying the UI much like what is seen in many sci-fi films.  In order to make this display interactive, we need to implement a way to interact with it.  For this we will be using Ubi Interactive which uses a short throw camera and a laser sensor to read touch events on the displayed surface.  With this hardware we can detect up to 20 touch points, allowing for a maximum of 10 concurrent users.\n\nThis display will be placed on top of a wooden or metal kick box to keep users from accidentally kicking or shattering the glass.

It also needs to be easy to understand and navigate for the user.  Because of this we are planning on using a \"live tile\" system, where bits of useful information are displayed periodically on their respective tile.  We are also thinking about developing this as a three-dimensional tree structure where the user is flown\/zoomed into the next layer of whichever menu options they choose.  We also need to consider how information will be updated after we leave and for this we want to make a separate UI for adding information more easily.\n\n===UI Parts===\n*User experience UI\n*Admin editing UI\n\n===User Experience UI===\nFor the user experience we are planning on offering these options:\n*Map of engineering building\/campus\n*Map and information on parking\n*History of programs with timelines and photos\n*History of Deans of the college of engineering with timelines and photos\n*Faculty of the college of engineering\n*Academy of Engineering members\n*Class schedules and rooms\n*Student clubs in the college\n*Information on majors\n*NAE Grand Challenges\n*Events list\/calendar\nMore will be added to this list as we think of them.\n\nBecause our display will reach up to the ceiling, we recognize that most people cannot reach that high.

The steam plants main purpose is to provide steam for heating and cooling inside the buildings on campus. As the load got higher, 3 more boilers were installed on site to help maintain the constant pressure and flow needed for the campus. The primary boiler used today is the wood boiler. It was installed in 1985 and can run a flow rate of up to 60,000 lb\/hr. The highest school load recorded was ~70,000 lb\/hr, therefore the other 3 boilers are natural gas fueled and are used at load amounts that exceed the capacity of the wood boiler.\n\n=Feasibility Analysis Specifications=\n*Electrical load profiling\n*Thermal load profiling\n*New utility rate structure analysis\n*Unit sizing\n*Thermal use determination\/distribution system analysis\n*Installation cost estimates \n*Permitting impacts\n*Utility interconnection requirements\n*Financial calculations(simple payback, IRR, Cash Flow Diagrams)\n*Presentation of six design\/construction models to client\n*Fully develop client design preference\n\n\n=Current System Model=\n[[File:UI_Steamplant_(Current_System)(with_pictures).jpg|thumb|right|280px|UI Steam Plant Current System]]\nThe Current System Model is broken up into 7 stages.\n*Boilers\n*Pressure Reducing Valves\n*Condenser(Campus)\n*Condensate Tank\n*Condensate Pumps\n*Dearator Tank\n*Feedwater Pumps\n{|width=\"100%\"\n|    \n|}\n== Model Options ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!width=\"150px\"|Turbine Model\n!Description\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| Simple Turbine Model\n|style=\"padding:5px\"|This Turbine option will consist of 1 turbine that runs alongside the current PRV's.

Also, the steam in this system will require superheating to get max efficiency from our turbine. Superheating steam will require much more safety and preventative maintenance for the plant as well.\n\n\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|[[File:Methodology1.png|frameless|center|300px|]]\n\n\n|}\n=Team Members=\n\n\n{| width=\"800\" border=\"2\"\n|-\n!

The decision to pursue an engineering degree developed out of a dissatisfaction with my then career prospects as a telecommunication contractor and a desire to obtain a theoretical background for electrical engineering.  For the last two years I have greatly enjoyed the opportunity to work with the University of Idaho Industrial Assessment Center.  Working with the UIIAC on energy efficiency audits as well as taking the Lean Manufacturing Course through the Mechanical Engineering Department has provided me with the opportunity to see concepts learned in the class room actually being applied in industry.  Upon graduation, I hope to apply my previous experiences as a residential framing business owner and telecommunications contractor with my newly found skills in electrical engineering and energy efficiency towards a career within both the power engineering \/construction fields.\n\nExpected Graduation: August 2015\n\n|}\n|| EE\n|- align=\"left\"\n| [[File:Photo Oct 03, 6 18 59 PM.jpg|150px|center]]||align=\"top\"|\n{| align=\"top\"\n| align=\"top\"|'''Chad Dunkel'''\n|-\n| My name is Chad Dunkel and I am interested in energy engineering, industrial processes, and industrial waste streams.

Sponsors, picture, faculty, and mentors may need changed-->\n\nThe Vandal Hybrid Racing Team is a University organization that competes annually at the Formula Hybrid competition hosted by the Society of Automotive Engineers. This team gives students the opportunity to demonstrate and further develop their engineering skills by challenging them to build a hybrid formula car. Because of the complexity of a hybrid vehicle, building it involves interdisciplinary collaboration between students. For the 2015 competition, the team will be using the same frame that was used in the 2014 competition. \n\n\n==Problem Statement==\nBecause the 2014 frame will be used in the 2015 competition, it is required that significant improvements must be made to the car. The team will strive to improve the car by redesigning problem components, reducing weight where possible, improving car handling, and increasing vehicle efficiency. This will produce a responsive, reliable, lightweight, high performance hybrid car.\n\n==Sub-System Problems and Improvements==\n\n===Brake Rotors===\n'''ISSUES:''' Front and rear brake rotors are larger than needed; only a fraction of the available friction surface is being used. Also, rear brake rotors are susceptible to cracking due to insufficient heat dissipation of the thin slotted design\n'''SOLUTION:'''\n*Redesign front and rear rotors, optimizing friction surface areas\n*Float both the front and rear rotors to reduce weight\n*Rear rotors will no longer be used for wheel speed sensor\nProgress: design done, material needs to be attained or designs need to be ordered.\n\n===Rear Wheel Toe===\n'''ISSUE:''' The toe in the rear wheels has slop in it due to flexing and component bending.

While the engine was off of the car, we noticed the crankshaft had a shaft endplay of 0.0475\". The stock engine case allows for \n0.016\" of endplay. To reduce the amount of endplay in our case, 0.020\" shims were placed under the main bearings. This reduced measured endplay to about 0.009\" and kept the connecting rod well centered in the cylinder. These shims should stop the crankshaft wearing behind the flywheel and should keep the connecting rod from developing excessive lateral endplay. \n\n'''SOLUTIONS:'''\n*fix crankshaft endplay with under-bearing shims\n*Run tests on the dyno engine and use that data to tune the race engine.\n*Maintain engine during driving\/testing days.\n\n===Steering Angle Sensor===\n'''ISSUE:'''\n*We currently have no way of logging steering angle data\n'''SOLUTION:'''\n*Design a sensor that can be used to log real time steering angle on the track\n\nProgress: Design made, needs to be prototyped and tested. \n\n===Wheel Speed Sensors===\n'''ISSUE:'''Current wheel speed sensor system requires brake rotors for timing.

The goal of their collaboration was to create a full drum set that could easily be played and moved easily by a single person during marching band performances. \n\nThe Fall of 2011 marked the beginning research of ideas for what they called the Beest. This acedemic year was solely an experimentation year; For more in depth design details refer to the [http:\/\/seniordesign.engr.uidaho.edu\/2011-2012\/drumroll\/main.html '''Team Drum Roll'''] webpage.\n\nThe design team of 2012-2013 made progress with the BandBeesten's design. Dan Mathewson, a UI graduate student, designed a robotic, power driven front wheel to enable the machine received commands through the operator's body movements. This design made it onto the field and more information on this can be found in Dan Mathewson's thesis. \n\nIn 2013, the design team started designing a new BandBeesten with a sturdier frame. This design relied only on man-power and did not have any assisting motors. The design used was very strong and could hold a full set of drums with ease. more information about this design can be found at \n\n[[#toc|''Return to contents'']]\n\n==Design Specifications==\n::*Move forward backward, and do 360 degree rotations.\n::*Have a forward speed of 2 mph\n::*Have a reverse speed of 2\/3 mph\n::*Complete a 360 degree rotation in under 2 seconds\n::*Lightweight\/ sturdy design\n::*Able to support ~150 lb\n::*Be able to stay charged during long performances \n\n[[#toc|''Return to contents'']]","timestamp":"20140703234837","user-timestamp":"20140602200821","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Water_Egress_Simulator","comment":"Created page with \"{|{{InfoboxBegin  |  |caption= CAD Model for the Final Product of the Simulator }} {{InfoboxEntry  |title = Client :  |content = Department of Interior }} {{InfoboxEntry  |tit...\"","content":"{|{{InfoboxBegin\n |\n |caption= CAD Model for the Final Product of the Simulator\n}}\n{{InfoboxEntry\n |title = Client :\n |content = Department of Interior\n}}\n{{InfoboxEntry\n |title = Team Name :\n |content = Aqua Egression\n}}\n{{InfoboxEntry\n |title = Duration :\n |content = Summer 2015 - Fall 2015\n}}\n{{InfoboxEntry\n |title = Faculty Advisors :\n |content =\n[http:\/\/www.uidaho.edu\/engr\/me\/faculty\/stevenbeyerlein Dr. Steve Beyerlein]\n}}\n{{InfoboxEntry\n |title = Mentor :\n |content = \n}}\n{{InfoboxEntry\n |title = Group Members :\n |content =\nAli Alfayez (Wiki Page)\n\nAbdulhady  Alhajeri (Secretary)\n\nJacob Lemmelin (Client Contact)\n\nColin Sowards (Budget Person)\n\n}}\n|}\nThe goal of the project is to design a simulator to train pilots to escape from their aircraft incase of submerge. Two trainers will be strapped inside the simulator using seatbelts and will be pushed into a pool. Other assistances in the pool will hold down the simulator until it reaches the pool\u2019s floor. They will give a signal to the trainers in the simulator so they start unstrapping the seatbelt and egress from the sides of the simulator.\n\n\n== Problem Definition ==\n===Problem Statement===\nThe current design of the simulator works perfectly as needed. However, there are some problems that occur in the current design. Department of Interior reports that the current simulator suffers from breaking joints and that problem caused by the materials used to design the simulator, which is PVC. The pictures below show the areas where joint exactly broken.\n===Goal===\nThe goal of the project is to design a simulator that will be lighter, stronger, easy to assemble and disassemble, transportable and affordable. \n===Background===\nPicture of the client or something related to the client if possible\nAccording to Rick Gividen, chief training division at the U.S. Department of the Interior, the idea came after two accidents occurred at the U.S. Department of the Interior in 2010 and 2013 where the pilots hardly escaped from the plane. Now, new pilots at the U.S. Department of the Interior have to go through a course where they are strapped in the simulator and pushed into a pool then try to escape from simulator.\nAs a result, the U.S. Department of the Interior demands such simulators that could be stronger that the current design. The reason of that is simulators are shipped from a city to another city and maybe from a state to another state. Shipping is one of the reasons why the current simulator has cracks and breaking joints.\n\n=== Specifications===\nCapacity: Seat 2 people 5\u2019 \u2013 6\u20194\u201d comfortably 4\u20196\u201d \u2013 6\u20199\u201d uncomfortably.\nWater Proof: Components should be water proofed and corrosion resistince. \nShipping Boxes: Final contents of shipping must not exceed 75 lbs. \/box and 108\" in length and 165\" in length plus girth.\nToleration: Broken assemblies both through shipping or use must be economically feasible and field reparable. 50% weight variance between seats.  I.e. 300 lbs.\/150lbs seat.\nCost: Less than the cost of current (pipe + fittings + seats + seatbelts + netting + glue + labor) + cases = $2,217.8.\nSeat Criteria: Seat up to 500 lbs. total. Seating either tandem or side by side.\nAssembly: Assemble in less than 1 hour.\nDisassembly: Disassemble in less than 1 hour.\n\n==New Design==\nThe new design will be made out of aluminum and not PVC. Specifically, aluminum T-Slots that will allow us to assemble and disassemble the simulator by tightening and loosing screws. Aluminum is a material that has very good corrosion resistance as well as reasonable weight. Moreover, aluminum is not a rare material so it doesn\u2019t cost much. It is also a tough material that doesn\u2019t bend or break easily.\nInclude a drawing that indicates the measurement of all components\nInclude stress and bending analysis picture\nWhen the group proposed to the client about using aluminum T-Slots instead of PVC, there were a lot of concerns of whether using such material will damage the floor when pushing the simulator to the pool. Also, sharp edges might be dangerous while assembling and disassembling.\nAfter reviewing questions and concerns from our client, we have purchased Plastic Strips that could be attached at the bottom of the simulator, which will make the simulator slip easily and smoothly as well. Moreover, Caps also we purchased to cover the sharp edges that the client were concerned about.\nPicture of the plastic strips and caps\n\n==Project Learning==\n\n== Team Information ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color:3D3D3D; background: #FFFFFF\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|[[|150px|center]]\n|-\n|''' ''Name'''\n|rowspan=\"4\"|''Hobbies & Interests:' \n\n\n''Career Goals: '' \n|-\n|''Mechanical Engineering Undergraduate''\n|-\n|Hometown: \n|-\n|Email: |- \n|rowspan=\"5\"|[[|150px|center]]\n|-\n|''' ''Name'''\n|rowspan=\"4\"|''Hobbies & Interests:' \n\n\n''Career Goals: '' \n|-\n|''Mechanical Engineering Undergraduate''\n|-\n|Hometown: \n|-\n|Email: |- \n|rowspan=\"5\"|[[|150px|center]]\n|-\n\n|''' ''Name'''\n|rowspan=\"4\"|''Hobbies & Interests:' \n\n\n''Career Goals: '' \n|-\n|''Mechanical Engineering Undergraduate''\n|-\n|Hometown: \n|-\n|Email: |- \n|rowspan=\"5\"|[[|150px|center]]\n|-\n\n|''' ''Name'''\n|rowspan=\"4\"|''Hobbies & Interests:' \n\n\n''Career Goals: '' \n|-\n|''Mechanical Engineering Undergraduate''\n|-\n|Hometown: \n|-\n|Email: |- \n|rowspan=\"5\"|[[|150px|center]]\n|-","timestamp":"20151110191223","user-timestamp":"20150603013426","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Web-based_Security_Hardening","comment":"Created page with \"A web-based document platform for managing and distributing security documents and hardening information dynamically  {|{{InfoboxBegin  |image=2015_WebHDG_internet-security.jp...\"","content":"A web-based document platform for managing and distributing security documents and hardening information dynamically\n\n{|{{InfoboxBegin\n |image=2015_WebHDG_internet-security.jpg\n}}\n{{InfoboxEntry\n |title = Mentor\n |content = Daniel Conte de Leon\n}}\n{{InfoboxEntry\n |title = Team Name\n |content = Alice\n}}\n{{InfoboxEntry\n |title = Duration\n |content = Fall 2015 - Spring 2016\n}}\n\n{{InfoboxEntry\n |title = Students\n |content = \n<ul>\n<li>Casey Blair<\/li>\n<li>Keith Drew<\/li>\n<li>Christopher Goes<\/li>\n<li>Antonious Stalick<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n}}\n|}\n\n===Problem Statement===\n<ul>\n<li>Hardening\/Security information is available, but spread out and not centralized<\/li>\n<li>Pre-requisite information is often not included in a hardening guide, leaving the reader to wonder \u201cWhy am I doing this?\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Trying to find prerequisite information can lead the seeker on a \u201cSix degrees of Kevin Bacon\u201d Wikipedia goose chase<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n===Specifications===\n\n\n===Design===\n\n\n===Design Goals===\n\n<ul>\n<li>To build a web-based application that allows the addition of new content and dynamically generated hardening guides with pre-requisite information included<\/li>\n<li>To provide a source of hardening information for any platform, provided the content has been added to the database<\/li>\n<li>Make content easy to understand for a non-technical user, in a format that is easy to follow<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n===Implementation===\n\n* [https:\/\/github.com\/ccasey645\/CS480-Alice\/ Team Github]\n\n===Snapshot Day===\n\n===Project Deliverables===\n\n\n\n==Team Biographies==\n\n===Casey Blair===\n\n''Computer Science Student''\n\nHometown: ???\n\nBio: Mysterious Ninja...\n\nEmail: [mailto:blai1919@vandals.uidaho.edu blai1919@vandals.uidaho.edu]\n{| width=\"100%\"\n|\n|}\n\n\n[[File:2014_Ethtool_Drew.jpg|thumb|150px|left]]\n===Keith Drew===\n\n''Computer Science Student''\n\nHometown: Olympia, Washington\n\nBio: Keith is a senior undergraduate student in Computer Science at the University of Idaho.

Allow the sub to respond to keyboard input'''\n::* Include program that will accept keyboard and act on keyboard input\n\n'''17. Thrusters will respond to input from the sub'''\n::* Program will activate the thrusters to execute a task\n==Current Design==\n[[File:2014 robosub Frame Underside.jpg|thumb|left]]\n===Sub Frame===\n[[File:2014 robosub Hull.jpg|thumb|left]]\nThe frame is constructed principally from extruded aluminum beams to which the various other components will be secured. The battery packs and the control system of the sub will be enclosed respectively in two waterproof cylinders. The external sensors and motors of the sub will be attached to the frame. All connections between power, control, and sensors will be done with cables running through through waterproof ports.\n===Thrusters===\nThe sub is outfitted with six thrusters which will be able to control all movement in the xyz plane as well as roll (rotating around forward axis) and pitch\/yaw (incline from fore to aft). The thrusters will be directly controlled by the microcontrollers based on commands sent from the PC.\n===Sensors===\nThe sub is outfitted with numerous sensors including audio (three hydrophones), visual (four cameras), accelerometer, magnetometer (compass), thermometer, depth sensor, gyroscope. All sensors other than visual\/audio, which feed directly into the PC, will be polled by a microcontroller at regular intervals. The microcontroller will create a packet with the sensor reading and device information which will be sent to the PC.\n===Grabbing Arms===\n[[File:2014 robosub Marker Dropper.jpg|thumb|left]]\nThe sub has two grabbing arms, each of which is controlled with a stepper motor; one in front and one on the bottom. The front claw also functions as the marker dropper.  As the marker dropper tasks will be completed before the grabbing tasks, the arm will being at fully open and then as it closes will drop the first and then the second marker before closing fully. By telling the arm to close only a certain amount the dropping of the first and second markers can be controlled.\n===Torpedo Launchers===\n[[File:2014 robosub Pneumatic System.jpg|thumb|left]]\nThe sub has two pneumatically controlled torpedo launchers pointing forward. They are actuated by signals from one of the microcontrollers. The compressed air canister that powers the launchers is situated so that it can be quickly and easily replaced.\n===Control System===\nAll sensor and motor functions within the sub are managed by PIC32 microcontrollers, with the exception of the visual and audio sensors which are fed directly to the PC. The PIC32 polls each sensor in series at times based on timer interrupts, packages the data with an identifying header and sends it to the PC through an I2C connection. The PC processes the data and the AI software identifies which motor commands are required. The command packet is sent to the PIC32s over in I2C bus. The packet contains a header specifying the target devices so that the microcontroller will know where to send it.\n===Movement Module Prototype===\n'''The movement module prototype is required to do the following to be useful to the system that was previously described:'''\n::* Gather key events from a keyboard, including single key events, or a polling event in the case of a continuously held key.\n::* Regulate the amount of events processed and data broadcasted as to not overload the socket communication module with too many requests. This feature is required to share the broadcaster and socket communication with the other parallel executing modules. \n::* Evaluate the appropriate movement logic to execute a maneuver effectively.\n::* Produce the required data to be broadcasted back to the micro-controller which will control the thrusters by providing a values to activate each thruster and the its power level.\n===User Input Movement Module: Tested===\n'''The user input movement module has been rewritten to integrate with the other python modules and the updated architecture.'''\n::* Movement is now handled as X,Y,Z values over three fields: location, orientation, and velocity\n::* The updated architecture has removed the broadcaster and now relies on inter-module communication handled by 0MQ and\na message process called the \"grapevine\" which communicates messages to the new logging module and others.\n::* The new X,Y,Z values are contained within Python dictionaries with the intent of being more friendly to future implementation of automated movement and AI integration.\n<br>\n\n==Team Members==\n{| width=\"100%\" border=\"2\"\n|-\n!

The rigid members of the tensegrity structure (such as the PVC members in the above prototype) are in compression, while the tensile members (the paracord) are in tension. Because all elements of the tensegrity structure are in pure compression or tension, no bending moment is ever applied to the structure, creating exceptionally resilient structures that are also very lightweight.\n\nThe goal of our team at the University of Idaho is to create a 6 or 12 strut spherical tensegrity robot that can withstand a 30 foot drop. In the second half of our project, our group plans to add actuators to the robot to roll the robot by adjusting string lengths. By the conclusion of our project, we hope to have a spherical tensegrity robot that can both withstand a 30 foot drop and move in a controlled fashion. We also will have full documentation and computer simulation of our design.\n\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><div style=\"clear: both\">\ufffd<\/div><\/div>\n----\n<div id=\"footer\">\n\n(c) 2008 University of Idaho.

It will significantly decrease the cycle time from on to off and allow for analysis of heater performance during testing.\n\n=Hottesters=\n\n*Ahmed Al Harbi\n**Senior, Electrical Engineering\n*Joe Eckroat\n**Senior, Mechanical Engineering\n*Neal Joslyn\n**Senior, Mechanical Engineering\n*Archana Shrestha\n**Senior, Electrical and Computer Engineering\n*Joe White\n**Senior, Mechanical Engineering\n\n\n=Problem Definition=\n\n==Background<ref>Problem definition supplied by client<\/ref>==\nThe R&D lab at Hotstart is charged with testing new product designs for a wide range of markets that use diesel engines.  During this testing process, a way to ensure product reliability in a short period of time is needed.  Long term testing (1 year +) is not always a feasible option before releasing a product, so a way to speed up this test to the span of a month or two is necessary.  \n\nHotstart manufactures two main types of coolant heaters. The first is a tank heater that uses the heat generated by the heating elements to force the hot coolant out of the top of the system into the engine while the colder coolant coming from the engine takes the place of the heated coolant in the bottom heater creating continuous flow (thermosyphon).  The other style is forced circulation, where a pump is used to circulate the coolant across the heating elements and throughout the engine.  Both styles use a bimetal snap-action thermostat to control the heating elements keeping the coolant inside the desired temperature range.\n\n==Design Requirements==\nLife cycle tester will:\n*Run on 120V input voltage\n*Be capable of safely handling up to 12kW of heating input\n*Be able to simultaneously test 12 heaters (1kW or lower due to previous requirement)\n*Have adjustable temperature setting for both the upper and lower temperature \n*Have adjustable flow settings if a heat transfer fluid is utilized\n*Allow for multiple voltage sources to power the heaters (1 or 3 phase, 120 \u2013 690V)\n*Display or make available easily, critical data for each test \u201cstation\u201d including, but not limited to: cycle count, power failure, heater failure, inlet and outlet temperatures \n*Be made from electrical components that are rated for at least 100k cycles at 50\u00b0C ambient or mitigate ambient conditions for components that are not properly rated\n*Use components sourced from Hotstart\u2019s current vendors unless absolutely not available\n*Contain all foreseeable spills automatically\n*Be complete with all documentation along with a manual and troubleshooting guide.  If a PLC is used, all documented code must be provided\n*Contain all branch circuit protection for all 12 heaters according to UL508A (We may need a supplier to build this part of the panel in order to get the proper sticker inside)\n\nIf Possible, the cycle tester will:\n*Be easily moveable\n*Be capable of testing coolant, oil, and air heaters\n*Be capable of simultaneously running multiple tests with different parameters and set points\n*Be capable of storing and outputting the test data in .csv (or comparable) format\n\n==Design Features==\n*Cycle counter\n*Inlet\/outlet temperature readings\n*Status Lights to show:\n**Current cycle condition (on,off)\n**Any malfunctions in the system\n*Possible Bluetooth\/Wi-Fi connectivity so the user can monitor status from a remote computer\n*Emergency shutoff in the case of a blow-out or other malfunction\n*Ability to digitally record temperatures for performance analysis\n\n=Design=\n\n==Prototypes and testing==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n\n|- \n| {{RowPicture|fileName=1stProto1.jpg|caption=1st Prototype|description=\"Sandbox\" prototype.

We learned that without water flowing past the thermostat in the heater, the heater will not turn off. During testing, the heater boiled the water and was turned off before it became dangerous. }}\n\n|- \n| {{RowPicture|fileName=3rdProto1.jpg|caption=3rd Prototype|description=Our 3rd prototype uses a small \u201ccirculation\u201d tank so that proper thermo-siphoning can be achieved there is no danger of boiling the water. The tank is small enough that cycle times can still be kept very short. When the heater has heated the volume of water, the system is flushed with water from a separate tank, and the cycle can start over. \n\nFrom this prototype we learned that there must be a breather tube on the small tank in order for air bubbles to escape the heater loop. We also learned that, to reduce volume, the small tank can be eliminated altogether.\n }}\n\n|- \n| {{RowPicture|fileName=20130906 145430.jpg|caption=Top-mounted thermostat|description=In order to further reduce cycle times of the engine heaters, we built a top-mounted thermostat. Because heat rises, the bottom mounted thermostat was not able to detect temperature changes quickly enough, which left us with huge temperature gradients in the system. \n\nThis design allows for much faster cycle times and less temperature variability in the heater loop. It also utilizes the original thermostat (stock from heater) for simplicity. Future designs will enable quick installation and removal via the use of copper fins which will easily mount to the thermostat. \n }}\n\n|}\n\n==Current design==\n{|\"width = 100%\"\n|-\n|[[File:Current_Design_7-28-2013.jpg]]\n|}\n\nThis design uses three cells that can operate at independent temperatures. Each cell can be used to test four 1kW heaters at once.\n\n===Design components===\n*Cold reservoir: A refrigeration unit keeps a 10 gallon tank of coolant at a constant temperature (the colder the better)\n*Heater reservoir: Each cell contains a heater reservoir which is used to supply coolant to each heater in that cell at a desired temperature (colder than 100F)\n*Heat exchangers: A plate & frame heat exchanger is used to exchange heat between the heater tank and cold tank for each cell\n**The cold side is supplied by the cold reservoir and is pumped in series through all heat exchangers. Because of this design feature, the coldest temperature set point should be chosen closest to the cold reservoir. \n**The hot side is supplied by a pump connected to the heater reservoir. The pumps will only be used to keep the coolant in the heater reservoir within the limits of the specified temperature, for example 70F +-2F\n*Heating cycle: Each heater will heat a small volume of coolant in a closed loop until the coolant reaches 120F. At this point, solenoid valves will open the loop and allow coolant from the reservoir to flush the loop, and the cycle starts over.\n*Pressurized rails: Each cell uses a pump to pressurize a 'rail' of fluid which is used to flush a heater at the end of its cycle. There is a small pressure relief or recirculation line, which also aids in the mixing of the fluid in the reservoir.\n*Valve control: Each valve in the system will be controlled by a master controller. The valves in the heating cycle loops will open or close depending on the status of the heater (on\/off).\n*Test information: Each heater station will contain the following information:\n**Cycle count\n**Heater Status (on\/off)\n**Inlet\/outlet temperatures\n**Emergency\/error light\n\n=References=\n<references\/>\n\n[[Category:Capstone design]]","timestamp":"20130917225938","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Wiki_Workshop","comment":"Created page with \"==Creating a log in== #click ''Create account'' on the upper right hand corner #username should be the prefix of your vandal email #email should be your vandal email #complete...\"","content":"==Creating a log in==\n#click ''Create account'' on the upper right hand corner\n#username should be the prefix of your vandal email\n#email should be your vandal email\n#complete form and click ''Create account''\n\n==Setup Account==\n#log in\n#click on your name in the upper left hand corner\n#Click on the create tab\n#Add your name and email to the page\n#Post comment:\n#click [[User:Alex7832|here]] and add your signature under you project name by typing four tildas: <nowiki>~~~~<\/nowiki>","timestamp":"20130918205212","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"12","title":"Capstone_Design","comment":"Created page with \" Design task of project...

Could use level three headings for each member, or a table.\n\n==Design Goals==\nUse bulleted\/numbered lists as necessary. If the design goals change\/clarify during initial interview, you should make note of that.\n\n==Design Specifications==\nMore detailed specifications of the design goals. \n\n==Initial Interviews==\n===Interview with Dan Mathewson===\nDan was the graduate student who worked with the omni-wheels, power system, and many other aspects on the previous model. We interviewed him to learn more about the 2012 design and to get any suggestions that he may have for improving this year's model. The following are the from this interview:\n\n:'''Omni-Wheels:'''\n::*Single omni-wheels were used because he wanted a constant contact surface on the ball for the drive system, which also reduced the cost.\n::*Since our drive system is primarly provided by the user (passive ball interaction), we should be able to use double wheels\n::*Suggested exploring other omni-wheel configurations and testing to see what is most efficient\/easy to pull and push. Such as:\n:::*Pointing toward the middle of the ball\n:::*Perpendicular to the middle of the ball (2012 configuration)\n\n:'''Transfer Casters:'''\n::*Mentioned as a possible replacement option as contact on the ball\n::*Need to make sure that they are invertable (ball down), which was an issue on the 2012 design\n\n:'''Frame Construction:'''\n::*Recommended a more rigid frame to prevent leg bending\n::*The \u0093spring\u0094 action of the 2012 design \u0093soaked up\u0094 some of the input force\n::*A more rigid frame would mean that there would be less force necessary to move the product\n\n:'''Weight Reduction Tips:'''\n::*Acrylic drums are much heavier than wood\n::*If LEDs are going to be used, use external fixtures instead of internal\n::*Cymbal hardware and drum clamps are very heavy and could use a redesign\n::*The large clamps that held the frame together weighed 2 - 3 pounds apiece\n\n===Interview with Denise Bauer===\nDr. Bauer is a Mechanical Engineering professor with an emphasis in Human Factors. As an expert in ergonomics we decided to interview her to learn how to connect the drummer comfortably to the Beest. The following are tips from the interview:\n\n:'''Operational Factors'''\n::*Individual's center of gravity varies, even with similar heights\n::*A few differences between male and females users should be noted\n:::*Center of gravity - The average male has a higher CoG than the average female\n:::*Strength - The average male is stronger than the average female\n::*User comfort is very important, create a mock-up then test it with the potential users to get feedback\n:::*Develop a rating scale to measure comfort\/pain as well as effort needed to operate it\n\n:'''General Facts'''\n::*Getting in and out of the apparatus needs to be simple\n::*Most products on the market are designed for the 95th percentile male\n::*The lower body can produce more power than the upper body\n:::*Since the upper body is weaker, using it to push a machine may be hard on the back\n:::*If the control is through the hips the upper body will have more mobility to operate the drums\n\n==Concept Development==\n\n===Wheel Design===\n\n:'''Problems from 2012:'''\n::*Needed power assistance to roll omni-wheels\n::*Basketball lost air occassionally\n::*Plastic balls on back did not roll well on turf\n::*Metal casters became dirty and would not spin properly depending on orientation\n:'''Improvements for 2013:'''\n::*Find a lower friction alternative setup for omni-wheels and casters\n::*Allow for high loads on each wheel\n::*Each wheel must roll smoothly on various surfaces, especially turf\n::*Basketball testing to prove\/disprove it as a viable option\n\n{|

Platform'''\n\nA small test platform test was created with thin bent brackets bolted onto angled wood blocks.\n\nThree of these were created and oriented so that the wheels would touch a ball at roughly the same angle.\n\nThe ball was then rotated by hand to see how the orientation functioned.\n\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|'''Pros:'''\n::*Revealed that the omni-wheels had small gaps that affected the rotational direction of the ball\n::*Good for visualizing new orientations\n\n'''Cons:'''\n::*The brackets were flimsy and bent easily\n::*Not measured to the accuracy that is needed for

setup]]\n\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"| '''Initial Wheel Concept'''\n\nThis is a concept render of a possible solution to the ball wheels.\n\nThis idea uses six ball casters, three on each of the top and bottom rings.\n\nEach ring is connected rigidly in a triangular shape with a series of tubes and clamps, while using the weight of the drum set to keep the ball in place.\n\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|'''Pros:'''\n::*Using invertable casters could greatly lessen friction\n::*Keeps wheel in place\n::*Easy setup and manufacturing\n::*Very lightweight\n::*Stable wheel design\n::*Helps

test the friction coefficients of casters and omni-wheels.\n\nThe apparatus allows for the use of both casters and omni-wheels, and their position can be adjusted to find the optimal settings.\n\nThe omni-wheels can be rotated in 90<sup>o<\/sup> increments to test for the most effective orientation.\n\nAn electronic fish scale will be used to measure the amount of force needed to pull the apparatus across a table.\n\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|'''Pros:'''\n::*Allows many angles and orientations\n::*Allows testing of omni-wheels in pairs and as singles for comparison\n::*Strong enough to stay rigid during testing\n::*Will give us insight into what arrangement to use on the final design\n\n'''Cons:'''\n::*Balancing the apparatus may be challenging\n::*Fabrication may be time-consuming\n\n|-\n\n| [[File:Omniball.JPG|thumb|center|200px|Final concept render to be manufactured]]\n\n|valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"| '''Final Concept'''\n\nasdf\n\n|valign=\"top\"

arrangement difficult for percussionist\n::*Each leg delayed movement slightly in all directions\n::*Not easy to customize instrument type or layout\n::*Overweight and bulky, not easy to transport\n::*Not visually appealing or ergonomic\n:'''Improvements for 2013:'''\n::*Lower center of gravity of full setup\n::*Rework drummer input system\n::*Stiffen wheel attachment for a more

1'''\n\nThe Hex-like shaped frame is the top choice from the table above.\n\nIt was built out of wood and metal brackets, with casters in three corners.\n\nIt should be noted that it is not a perfect hexagonal shape.\n\nThe angle at which the casters are connected is 135<sup>o<\/sup>, while the others are 105<sup>o<\/sup>.\n\nThese angles were chosen to provide optimum step range with a drummer in

paired omni-wheels, and ball casters.\n\nThe types will be tested using angles ranging from 40<sup>o<\/sup> up to 55<sup>o<\/sup>, and the omni-wheels will be oriented either vertically or horizontally.\n\nOnce the forces are recorded and the apparatus is weighed, the friction can be calculated for each variation.\n\nFor the full test explanation, see the final report:\n\n'add link to

The main piece is larger and holds the robot as well as the electronic equipment below the robot platform. The two side pieces hang on opposite sides of the central piece. The sides are attached as shown with the bolt holding it.As with other designs the doors are wire mesh with polycarbonate sides for viewing.The design is simple and uses fewer parts. Fewer parts make disassembling and regular maintenance easy.\n\n====Previous Designs====\n\n'''Two Piece Design'''\n{|\n| [[File:proto1.jpg|x200px|thumb|Full Model]]\n\n| [[File:proto2.jpg|x200px|thumb|One Side]]\n\n| [[File:proto3.jpg|x200px|thumb|With Lower Doors]]\n\n|}\n\n<br style=\"clear:both\" \/>\nOur first conceptual design was the two piece design.The two piece design uses two identical sides to make up the enclosure. Separation of the enclosure is needed to fit on the service elevator for transport. The partitions are depicted above. The robot is affixed to both sides in the center.The front and back use polycarbonate sheets and a wire mesh is used for the doors. The lower portion of the design will store the controller and safety equipment on one side. The other side can store objects for demonstration such as an armature. Caster wheels are used on the bottom.\n\n'''Collapsible Design'''\n{|\n| [[File:singleaccordionopenrender_1.jpg|350x200px|thumb|Full Model Open]]\n\n| [[File:singleaccordionclosingrender_1.jpg|350x200px|thumb|Closing]]\n\n| [[File:accordioninmotion.gif|200px|thumb|How hinge works]]\n\n|}\n{|\n| [[File:singleaccordionclosedrender_1.jpg|350x200px|thumb|Closed]]\n\n| [[File:doubleaccordionrender_1.jpg|350x200px|thumb|With two robots]]\n\n|}\n\n<br style=\"clear:both\" \/>\n\nThe collapsible design is made of one central piece with two attached sides. The design is similar to the 3 piece, but instead of having sides that can be removed, the sides collapse to minimize space. The sides also have supports that reach the ground instead of hanging, but still remove the shelving on the lower portion.\n<br style=\"clear:both\" \/>\n\n====Options====\n\n'''Safety light curtain'''\n\nWe have decided that the light curtain was not cost effective for the project but it may be beneficial for other projects.The safety light curtain can be used to have a completely open viewing area on one side of the enclosure. A problem is if the robot is manipulating an object the curtain can't stop the object if it is thrown past. To fix this, we can use a detachable polycarbonate sheet when objects are being used otherwise leave it off. \n\n'''Separation of enclosure'''\n\nThe enclosure needs to separate or at least minimize because the full expanded enclosure can't fit in the service elevator.  \n\n'''Top of enclosure'''\n\nThe top of the enclosure will likely be a simple mesh covering. The top shouldn't interfere with visibility, but a top is needed to keep objects out.\n\n'''Base'''\n\nWe have decided to use legs instead of wheels however there are some tradeoffs. The base design can use wheels or just legs on the ground. With wheels, the enclosure can be pushed around anywhere. Another option is just have it lifted by a jack and transported.

The battery packs and the control system of the sub will be enclosed respectively in two waterproof cylinders. The external sensors and motors of the sub will be attached to the frame. All connections between power, control, and sensors will be done with cables running through through waterproof ports.\n===Thrusters===\nThe sub is outfitted with six thrusters which will be able to control all movement in the xyz plane as well as roll (rotating around forward axis) and pitch\/yaw (incline from fore to aft). The thrusters will be directly controlled by the microcontrollers based on commands sent from the PC.\n===Sensors===\nThe sub is outfitted with numerous sensors including audio (three hydrophones), visual (four cameras), accelerometer, magnetometer (compass), thermometer, depth sensor, gyroscope. All sensors other than visual\/audio, which feed directly into the PC, will be polled by a microcontroller at regular intervals. The microcontroller will create a packet with the sensor reading and device information which will be sent to the PC.\n===Grabbing Arms===\n[[File:2014 robosub Marker Dropper.jpg|thumb|left]]\nThe sub has two grabbing arms, each of which is controlled with a stepper motor; one in front and one on the bottom. The front claw also functions as the marker dropper.  As the marker dropper tasks will be completed before the grabbing tasks, the arm will being at fully open and then as it closes will drop the first and then the second marker before closing fully. By telling the arm to close only a certain amount the dropping of the first and second markers can be controlled.\n===Torpedo Launchers===\n[[File:2014 robosub Pneumatic System.jpg|thumb|left]]\nThe sub has two pneumatically controlled torpedo launchers pointing forward. They are actuated by signals from one of the microcontrollers. The compressed air canister that powers the launchers is situated so that it can be quickly and easily replaced.\n===Control System===\nAll sensor and motor functions within the sub are managed by PIC32 microcontrollers, with the exception of the visual and audio sensors which are fed directly to the PC. The PIC32 polls each sensor in series at times based on timer interrupts, packages the data with an identifying header and sends it to the PC through an I2C connection. The PC processes the data and the AI software identifies which motor commands are required. The command packet is sent to the PIC32s over in I2C bus. The packet contains a header specifying the target devices so that the microcontroller will know where to send it.\n===Movement Module Prototype===\n'''The movement module prototype is required to do the following to be useful to the system that was previously described:'''\n::* Gather key events from a keyboard, including single key events, or a polling event in the case of a continuously held key.\n::* Regulate the amount of events processed and data broadcasted as to not overload the socket communication module with too many requests. This feature is required to share the broadcaster and socket communication with the other parallel executing modules. \n::* Evaluate the appropriate movement logic to execute a maneuver effectively.\n::* Produce the required data to be broadcasted back to the micro-controller which will control the thrusters by providing a values to activate each thruster and the its power level.\n===User Input Movement Module: Tested===\n'''The user input movement module has been rewritten to integrate with the other python modules and the updated architecture.'''\n::* Movement is now handled as X,Y,Z values over three fields: location, orientation, and velocity\n::* The updated architecture has removed the broadcaster and now relies on inter-module communication handled by 0MQ and\na message process called the \"grapevine\" which communicates messages to the new logging module and others.\n::* The new X,Y,Z values are contained within Python dictionaries with the intent of being more friendly to future implementation of automated movement and AI integration.\n<br>\n\n==Team Members==\n{| width=\"100%\" border=\"2\"\n|-\n!
