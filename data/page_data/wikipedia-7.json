Vorster was known for his staunch adherence to [[apartheid]], overseeing as Minister of Justice during the [[Rivonia Trial]] in which [[Nelson Mandela]] was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] for [[Nelson Mandela#Arrest and Rivonia trial: 1962\u20131964|sabotage]], and as Prime Minister the [[Terrorism Act of 1967|Terrorism Act]], the [[Separate Representation of Voters Amendment Act, 1968|complete abolishment of non-white political representation]], the [[Soweto uprising|Soweto Riots]] and the [[Steve Biko]] crisis. He conducted a more pragmatic foreign policy than his predecessors in an effort to improve relations between the [[white minority rule|white minority government]] and South Africa's neighbours, particularly after the break-up of the [[Portuguese colonial empire]]. Shortly after the [[Internal Settlement]] in Rhodesia, in which he was instrumental, he was implicated in the [[Muldergate Scandal]] and resigned the premiership in favour of the ceremonial presidency, which he was forced to give up as well eight months later.\n\n== Early life ==\nVorster was born in 1915 at Uitenhage, [[Cape Province]], [[Union of South Africa]], the fifteenth son of a successful [[sheep farmer]].<ref name=\"sahistory\">\n{{cite web |url=http:\/\/www.sahistory.org.za\/pages\/people\/bios\/vorster-bj.htm |title=Balthazar Johannes Vorster |publisher=South African History Online |accessdate=5 January 2011}}\n<\/ref> He attended school there and then, as a law student, entered [[Stellenbosch University]], known as the \"cradle of Afrikaner nationalism.\"  With six out of the seven prime ministers South Africa had between 1910 and 1971 being students there, its influence on the development of [[Afrikaner culture]] has been profound. Vorster involved himself in student politics becoming the chairman of the debating society, deputy chairman of the student council and leader of the junior [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]].<ref name=\"bookrags\">\n{{cite web |url=http:\/\/www.bookrags.com\/biography\/balthazar-johannes-vorster\/ |title=Balthazar Johannes Vorster Biography |author=Bookrags.com |accessdate=5 January 2011}}\n<\/ref>\n\nIn 1938, Vorster graduated to become a registrar (judge's clerk) to the judge president of the Cape Provincial Division of the South African Supreme Court.<ref name=\"bookrags\"\/> But he did not remain in this post for long, setting up his first law practice in [[Port Elizabeth]] and his second in the [[Witwatersrand]] town of [[Brakpan]].<ref name=\"sahistory\"\/><ref name=\"bookrags\"\/>\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Ossewabrandwag ===\nFrom 1939, Vorster attracted notoriety by strongly opposing South Africa's intervention on the side of the Allies and, their former foe, [[UK|Great Britain]] in [[World War II]].<ref name=\"sahistory\"\/> More out of an anti-British feeling than a positively pro-Nazi spirit, many Nationalists enthusiastically hoped for a German victory.<ref name=\"bookrags\"\/>\n\nVorster dedicated himself to an anti-British, pro-Nazi organisation called the ''[[Ossewabrandwag]]'' (''Ox-wagon Sentinel''), which had been founded in 1938 in celebration of the centenary of the [[Great Trek]]. Under the leadership of [[J. F. van Rensburg]], the Ossewabrandwag conducted many acts of sabotage against South Africa during World War II to limit its war effort. Vorster claimed not to have participated in the acts of war attributed to the group.<ref name=\"bookrags\"\/>\n\nVorster rose rapidly through the ranks of the Ossewabrandwag becoming a general in its paramilitary wing.<ref name=\"sahistory\"\/> His involvement with this group led to his detention at [[Koffiefontein]] in 1942.<ref name=\"bookrags\"\/> Following his release in 1944 from that detention camp, Vorster became active in the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], which began implementing the policy of [[apartheid]] in 1948. Although racial discrimination in favour of whites had long been a central fact of South African politics and society, the National Party institutionalised racism through apartheid legislation.\n\n=== House of Assembly ===\nIn 1953, Vorster was elected to the [[House of Assembly of South Africa|House of Assembly]] representing the seat of Nigel in the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]]. He was appointed as Deputy Minister in 1958.<ref name=\"sahistory\"\/> He was an [[Member of Parliament|MP]] during the terms of prime ministers [[Daniel Fran\u00e7ois Malan|D.F. Malan]], [[Johannes Gerhardus Strijdom|J.G. Strijdom]] and [[Hendrik Verwoerd]]. Vorster's past as a [[draft-dodger]] and Nazi sympathiser came back to haunt him. Vorster answered his critics by saying that he had now \"come to believe in\" the parliamentary system.\n\nA leader of the right wing of the National Party, he was appointed Minister of Justice in 1961 by PM Verwoerd, an outspoken mentor and idol of Vorster, and he combined that with Minister of Police and Prisons in 1966.<ref name=\"sahistory\"\/> Upon Verwoerd's assassination in 1966, Vorster was elected by the National Party to replace him. He continued Verwoerd's implementation of Apartheid legislation, and in 1968 abolished the last four parliamentary seats that had been reserved for white representatives of [[Coloured people|Coloured]] (mixed race) voters (realised in 1970).\n\nVorster's rule nevertheless oversaw several other such proposed bills dropped and the repealing of legislation prohibiting multi-racial sports teams to allow for South Africa to be admitted to the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in Mexico. Due to the protests of numerous African nations, however, the proposed team was rejected from competing. As a personal figure Vorster was described as \"flesh and blood\" by [[Progressive Party (South Africa)|Progressive]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Helen Suzman]] in contrast to the \"diabolical\" and \"frightening\" Verwoerd. His supporters held him in great affection for his eccentric and sometimes humorous manner. Notable examples of this were the occasion when he briefed the opposition in his private chambers, his allowing pictures of himself to be taken in often precarious situations and then to be distributed publicly as well as his welcoming of foreigners, in his words, to \"the happiest [[police state]] in the world\". This new outlook in the leadership of South Africa was dubbed \"billikheid\" or \"sweet reasonableness\".<ref>{{cite news| url=http:\/\/www.time.com\/time\/magazine\/article\/0,9171,941074,00.html | work=Time | title=South Africa: A Touch of Sweet Reasonableness | date=31 March 1967}}<\/ref> He alienated an extremist faction of his National Party when it accepted the presence of [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] players and spectators during the tour of the [[New Zealand national rugby union team]] in South Africa in 1970.\n\nMost notably, Vorster was more pragmatic than his predecessors when it came to foreign policy. He improved relations with other African nations, such as by the adoption of his policy of letting Black African diplomats live in white areas in South Africa. He unofficially supported, but refused officially to recognise, the neighbouring state of [[Rhodesia]], whose predominantly white minority government had [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared independence]] from Britain in 1965. Vorster followed white public opinion in South Africa by supporting Rhodesia publicly, but was unwilling to alienate important political allies in the United States by extending diplomatic recognition to Rhodesia. \n\nThe collapse of Portuguese rule in [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]] in 1975 left South Africa and Rhodesia as the sole outposts of [[white minority rule]] on the continent.  While Vorster was unwilling to make any concessions to his country's blacks, he soon concluded that white rule would be untenable in a country where blacks outnumbered whites 22:1.<ref name=\"impression\">{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.aliciapatterson.org\/APF001975\/Wright\/Wright12\/Wright12.html|title=APF newsletter, \"Appraisal of Rhodesia in 1975\"}}<\/ref> In September 1976, under pressure from US Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]], he pressured [[Ian Smith]], the [[Prime Minister of Rhodesia|Rhodesian Prime Minister]], to accept in principle that white minority rule could not continue indefinitely. Smith and non-militant black nationalist leaders signed the [[Internal Settlement]] in March 1978, and in June 1979, following [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia general election, 1979|multiracial elections]], Rhodesia was reconstituted under black majority rule as [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]].\n\n=== Retirement ===\nVorster retired as Prime Minister in 1978, after twelve years in office. He was succeeded by [[Pieter Willem Botha|P.W. Botha]], a hardliner who nevertheless began the first reforms to moderate the Apartheid system. Following his retirement as Prime Minister, Vorster was elected to the largely honorary position of [[State President of South Africa|State President]]. His tenure in that office, however, was short-lived. In what came to be known as the [[Muldergate Scandal]] so named after Dr [[Connie Mulder]], the Cabinet minister at the centre of it, Vorster was implicated in the use of a secret slush fund to establish ''[[The Citizen (newspaper, South Africa)|The Citizen]]'', the only major English language newspaper that was favourable to the National Party. A commission of inquiry concluded in mid-1979 that Vorster \"knew everything\" about the corruption and had tolerated it. He resigned from the presidency in disgrace. In 1982, John Vorster supported the [[Conservative Party (South Africa)|Conservative Party]] of [[Andries Treurnicht]] at its founding congress. He died in 1983, aged 67 years.\n\n== Publication ==\n* B.J. Vorster: ''Geredigeerde toesprake van die sewende Eerste Minister van Suid-Afrika. Deel 1: 1953\u20131974'' .

It was created to prevent what it refers to as \"wrongful disclosure of video tape rental or sale records [or similar audio visual materials, to cover items such as [[video games]] and the future [[DVD]] format].\"  Congress passed the VPPA after [[Robert Bork]]'s video rental history was published during [[Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination|his Supreme Court nomination]]. It makes any \"video tape service provider\" that discloses rental information outside the [[ordinary course of business]] liable for up to $2500 in actual damages. \n\n==Effects of the law==\nIn 2008, a class action lawsuit against [[Blockbuster Inc.]] was filed over the release of customer rental and sales records to [[Facebook]] through the controversial [[Facebook Beacon]] program. The lawsuit alleged the release of the records was a violation of the Video Privacy Protection Act.<ref name=\"VPPAFace\">Vijayan, Jaikumar (2008-04-18), \"[http:\/\/computerworld.com\/action\/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&taxonomyName=standards_and_legal_issues&articleId=9078938&taxonomyId=146 Blockbuster sued over Facebook Beacon information sharing]\".

[http:\/\/www.wired.com\/threatlevel\/2009\/12\/netflix-privacy-lawsuit \"Netflix Spilled Your Brokeback Mountain Secret, Lawsuit Claims\"], ''Wired Magazine''<\/ref>\n\nThis act was referenced in the ''[[Lane v. Facebook, Inc.]]'' class action. Based on this act it is generalized to other forms of rental records such as DVDs and Video games etc.\n\nNetflix cited the act in 2011 following the announcement of its global integration with Facebook. The company noted that the VPPA was the sole reason why the new feature was not immediately available in the United States, and it encouraged its customers to contact their representatives in support of legislation that would clarify the language of the law.<ref name=\"NetflixFacebook\">{{cite web | title=Help Us Bring Facebook Sharing to Netflix USA | work=Netflix Blog | url=http:\/\/blog.netflix.com\/2011\/09\/help-us-bring-facebook-sharing-to.html | accessdate=2011-09-22}}<\/ref>\n\nIn 2012, Netflix changed its privacy rules so that it no longer retains records for people who have left the site.

Strange group of arguments  for deletion: first, that there will be additional entries (there will never be reason to remove them, because once notable the site remains notable no matter what happens to it), and that since this group is very notable and very well known, the list is not encyclopedic. Unless the list is so broad in scope that it is unmanageably long, which it currently is not, there is no reason to divide it. If someone works on it sufficiently to justify making multiple more specific lists, then it can be split, but that an argument for keep and split, not delete, and it would be folly to delete what wee have because we want to write something more extensive.

This list (and the other one, which I can't tell the difference between) purports to list the contents of these categories:\n**[[:Category:Online retailers]] 82\n**[[:Category:Online retail companies by country]] 339 \n**[[:Category:Book selling websites]] 38\n**[[:Category:Online music stores]] 105\n**[[:Category:Online grocers]] 18\n**[[:Category:Commerce websites]] 181\n**[[:Category:Online music stores]] 105\n*If we add this up, it is about 868 articles which could conceivably be placed here. This does not even count *other* retailers which do some form of business online, allowing one to buy gift cards, mobile phone minutes, groceries, etc. I think it would be much more valuable to spend time sorting out the categories that exist, than to try to spend time maintaining this list which should technically have over 800 items in it. Finally the attempt to centrally catalogue what these sites sell, and where they sell to, is not encyclopedic or worth of a separate list; the list of items sold by any of these stores will change constantly; for example, 1-800 flowers, which is on both lists, doesn't only sell flowers; and the Amazon description of 'everything' is a great use of that term for marketing purposes, but also inaccurate; we might say amazon sells *a lot* of things, but they don't sell 'everything'. Thus, this list is too broad. I think a more interesting list might be notable retailers who do *not* have an online shopping available, since that is becoming more and more rare these days. --[[User:Karl.brown|KarlB]] ([[User talk:Karl.brown|talk]]) 15:41, 18 May 2012 (UTC)\n:* '''Comment''' - However, per [[WP:NOTDUP]], \"It is neither improper nor uncommon to simultaneously have a category, a list, and a navigation template which all cover the same topic.

For example, this list purports to provide information on:\n::** ''products sold''\n::** ''Headquarters''\n::** ''countries served''\n::*I would contend that at least two of those are not encyclopedic, and we should *not* attempt to store them. Countries served could be broadly interpreted; is it all countries where they are willing to ship their products? If so, Amazon (and many other retailers) will ship almost everywhere, and the policies about where they will ship will change frequently, so storing this info in wikipedia is not useful. Secondly, in terms of products sold, the preponderance of 'everything' just illustrates the pointlessness of that section - in looking down the list, I haven't found many which are actually correct, and I don't think we should try - JC Penny sells BBQ grills, and patio furniture, and tote bags... We already have categories for the big topics these stores cover - music, books, retail, etc, and I'm sure other useful categories could be created - but we should not have a list of products sold, because it is just guaranteed to be wrong. Finally, headquarters can be captured by the category (e.g. {{cl|Online_retail_companies_by_country}}. Again, as currently framed, or in its full extent, the question is, is this list useful for the encyclopedia to maintain - imagine there are 800 links? What I would suggest, as another option, is that you look at merging into these articles with existing lists of retailers, and note as an attribute where a given retailer has an online presence (which, as discussed before, is more common than not) - like [[List_of_bookstore_chains]] and other lists here {{cl|Lists_of_retailers}}. Then, we could have useful, small lists, and be able to sort on whether they have an option to purchase online - rather than just having a two separately maintained lists, one which has [[JC Penney]] and the other which has [[JCPenney.com]]. But even that is not ideal - as it requires us trying to track, when a given retailer has moved from a brochure-ware website into a website where you can purchase things - and what if they just allow purchase of gift cards, or downloading of coupons but no ordering? is that online shopping? The whole thing is a maintenance nightmare - and the current extent and wrongness of these lists just illustrates the wikipedia hasn't done a good job of maintaining them to date in spite of best efforts by editors. --[[User:Karl.brown|KarlB]] ([[User talk:Karl.brown|talk]]) 18:51, 18 May 2012 (UTC)\n::*'''comment''' one more thing - can the defenders of these lists at least explain what the difference is between the two? --[[User:Karl.brown|KarlB]] ([[User talk:Karl.brown|talk]]) 18:53, 18 May 2012 (UTC)\n::*'''comment''' a recent report: [http:\/\/www.ibisworld.com\/industry\/default.aspx?indid=1930], which suggests there are over 50,000 pure-play online retailers.

I don't believe that Costco.com, for instance, offers F-16s or investment banking services), ''headquarters'', ''date of establishment'', ''revenue'' and\/or ''traffic'' (some measure of number of visitors, customers or registered users).<br \/>Currently, I favor '''keeping''' the list and renaming it to [[List of online retailers]] or perhaps [[List of online-only retailers]]. -- '''[[User:Black Falcon|Black Falcon]]''' <sup>([[User talk:Black Falcon|talk]])<\/sup> 05:25, 21 May 2012 (UTC)\n*'''Delete''' - I am by all accounts a non deletionist and even I can't see a need for this one.

The list would never be completable and if it was would be thousands of rows long. I think the scope of this list is too broad and if kept it should be broken into more realistic and digestible chunks such as List of Online electronics stores, List of Online Shoe stores, etc. Even then I just think this amounts to an unneeded article that is not really very academic or encyclopedic. [[User:Kumioko|Kumioko]] ([[User talk:Kumioko|talk]]) 17:30, 21 May 2012 (UTC)\n*:::Thanks for your detailed response. I agree with the first part, that a list of retailers which are \"online in some form\" would be too broad and lack significance. It is safe to say, I think, that every notable retailer has a website and a large number (perhaps even most) allow online shopping. I suggested, above, limiting the scope of the list of retailers that conduct business primarily or exclusively online. Although I'm changing my mind about the former (How does one determine what constitutes \"primarily\"?), I think the latter idea \u2013 online-only retailers \u2013 would result in a list that is quite narrowly defined. It would exclude retailers such as Costco, Sears, Target and Walmart, focusing instead on ones such as Amazon.com, Bluefly and iTunes Store. Of course, one's mileage may vary as to whether online-only retailing is a significant characteristic around which to organize a list; however, it would be significantly more discriminate than the current list. -- '''[[User:Black Falcon|Black Falcon]]''' <sup>([[User talk:Black Falcon|talk]])<\/sup> 17:57, 21 May 2012 (UTC)\n*::::No problem, so I think limiting the scope would be a good start but I think we would have some trouble marking some since the cross multiple spectrums. Take Ebay and Amazon for example, both of them cater to multiple audiences, both cater only to online but are starting to seed into offline retailers. Amazon even has the multi million item US government NSN's (National Stock Numbers) for government goods so that the cheapest prices can be found. Using another example, and not trying to be too terribly innapropriate how do we define an \"online retailer\"? Would that include Adult sex sites, or porn sites? It could be argued that these are online retailers and it could be argued that these should have a list too since several make in the tens of millions of dollars a year. Even limiting to just Electronics online retailers I think we are going to get a very long list. In the end I just don't think that even if we spend the time to narrow down a set of definitions that the article\/list would be very encylcopedic. What would such an article really be for? How would we keep it updated? How would we keep it referenced? I just think that there are too many factors that makes this a bad list. I hope that helps.

The tendency to group a set of railway lines by report writers and journalists is not my personal responsibility to explain to you the issues raising from whether they 'fit' or 'make sense'.  The main point to be made is that in 1947, a royal commission writer chose to group a specific sense of lines together to explain an issue about the broader system at the time, and in the 2000s journalists have done the same.\n\nAs to sense, the labels 'agricultural railway lines', and 'agricultural railway lines' are labels used by report writer and journalists, and the purpose of the article was not to address whether they are currently open or closed, it has nothing to do with what might in reality be the eventual outcome of earlier or later lines, but in actaul fact the lines 'created' in the terms of the 1947 report writer making a point about the neglkect of the railway system.  \n\nAs to the comment ''Possibly there were previously non-wheatbelt agricultural railway lines and they were all closed'', has nothing to do with the intent or content of either of the articles, and is not part of what the purpose of offering the information on a wikipedia article.

If \"agricultural\" in this quote (and\/or as used for the title of the article) means something other than what the typical modern-day reader would expect ie [[agriculture|\"cultivation of animals, plants ...\"]] etc {{ndash}} for whatever reason {{ndash}} it would probably be helpful to the reader if the article said so explicitly. If the scope of the article is something other than railways for \"all ... agricultural land\" (for any definition of \"agricultural\"), as implied by the lead sentence, then the lead sentence should probably be reworded to define that scope.\n\n:Once it is clear to the average reader (without that reader having to go through the entire royal commission reports or the entire history of agriculture in WA) what the scope of the the articles is, and why there are two articles, the links between the articles and the categorization will make more sense (and\/or can be adjusted to match the article contents).

The map featured exaggeratedly wide streets that offered abundant room for clear labeling of addresses, transportation, and other terrain features.  Hagstrom began selling the map, soon expanding it to cover all of Manhattan, then all of New York City, then its outlying regions, eventually offering over 100 maps.<ref name=hagstrommap \/> \nThe [[New York City Subway]] used a Hagstrom design for its official subway maps during the 1940s.\n\nThe widened-street style was a [[wikt:hallmark|hallmark]] of Hagstrom's product line; although it added clarity in navigation and labeling, the widened streets borrowed their space from the surrounding blocks, in some cases reducing them to slivers; for instance, the [[Flatiron Building]] appeared as \"a speck where Broadway and Fifth Avenue converge\". Hagstrom also produced the \"redlining\" maps of New York City in 1938.<ref>http:\/\/planyourcity.net\/2014\/04\/28\/brooklyns-1938-redline-map HOLC Maps<\/ref> From 1941 to 2002, All of Hagstrom's New York City maps were based on a single master map that was updated by hand. This produced a number of other visual artifacts; new streets and neighborhoods had to be shoehorned into layouts designed around previously existing features. A number of quirky and archaic labels also remained, such as ''\"The Shed\"'', a large disused building on Pier 42 on the [[East River]], and [[Mussel Island]], a long-gone feature of [[Newtown Creek]].  In 2002, Hagstrom switched to all-digital master maps using more conventional layouts and labels.<ref name=times2002 \/>\n\nIn its heyday, the company's lineup included atlases, borough maps, maps of the [[Tri-State Region]] and detailed and quite colorful maps of midtown Manhattan. The midtown maps, which detailed most of the significant buildings and businesses ([[Rockefeller Center]], [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Pennsylvania Station]], [[Saks Fifth Avenue]], etc.) show the changing face of the city's business district, and have started to draw the attention of [[map collector]]s.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Hagstrom's catalog included maps of a number of cities beyond the New York area, including Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Houston, Indianapolis, and Philadelphia, though most of these publications were out of print by the 1990s.<ref name=hagstrommap \/>\n\nHagstrom had three retail stores; one in [[lower Manhattan]], one in [[midtown Manhattan|midtown]], and one in [[Washington, D.C.]]; all had closed by 2010.<ref name=endofroad>[http:\/\/www.nbcnewyork.com\/news\/local\/End-of-the-Road-for-Manhattan-Map-Store-98628834.html End of the Road for Manhattan Map Store]<\/ref>\n\nHagstrom was knighted by the [[King of Sweden]] for his success in America.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*[http:\/\/www.forgotten-ny.com\/STREET%20SCENES\/blissville\/blissville.html Laurel Hill on Forgotten NY Neighborhoods - scroll down to \"Map capital of the world\"]\n*[http:\/\/www.myrecollection.com\/christianog\/hagstromcode.html The Hagstrom Map Company Publication Code]\n\n[[Category:Map companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Queens, New York]]","timestamp":"20160410103141","user-timestamp":"20150410103141"},{"title":"User talk:Dylandla","content":"\n== May 2009 ==\n\n[[Image:Information.png|25px]] Welcome to Wikipedia.

Second, [[:Portal:Energy]] covers the energy topics but that is not a substitute for having a relevant navbox on an article. Third, electric assisted power train has to do with ecological footprints as bicycles with it have a larger footprint then a regular bicycle because of their need for oil and permaculture lowers the ecological footprint of mankind, so I do not see how you can say that. Forth, Behun's work was not wasted as all I did was improve on it; it was a good starting point. Fifth, it is not clutter to have a well organized navbox to help find related articles; it actually reduces clutter by organizing what would be an incomplete and disorganized list under see also.

Please see my comments on the talk page there. Bottom line is that if it's a \"common name\" then it would be in common use and it should be trivial to document its widespread occurrence other than as a search term used on three pest control pages (which is, in all honesty, about all I see using Google). In this case you can't, because it isn't in common use. My dad taught me to call [[carabidae|carabid beetles]] \"gooney bugs\" when I was growing up, and only later did I find out that this was a name he and his brother had made up, and not a \"common name\" at all. Since I identify insects for a living, I get to hear all sorts of names that people learned from ''their'' parents, etc., and they do NOT all get included in Wikipedia. With evidence of common use, sure, I and any other editor will gladly accept the inclusion of ANY legitimate common name, but \"wood bee\" is a [[neologism]], just like \"boring bee\" (which also appears on one of those pest control pages). It might not be a unique term - it's certainly an easy name for people to make up, meaning people could make it up independently, but that is not the same thing as a [[common name]] (if you want a parallel, please look at the [[Dobsonfly]] page; \"dobsonfly\" is their common name, although I've heard numerous people call them \"pincher bugs\" - but that latter name does NOT get included in Wikipedia). Doesn't the fact that you had to ''create'' a \"wood bee\" redirect tell you something about how ''uncommon'' the term is? Again, it's not that I don't believe that there are a handful of people who call them \"wood bees\", it's that this is not a common e\"nough practice to include it in an encyclopedia. It'd be like going to the [[tarantula]] article and editing it to read \"also called '''big, hairy spiders'''\". It might be true in the literal sense, but it's trivial. [[User:Dyanega|Dyanega]] ([[User talk:Dyanega|talk]]) 05:55, 16 August 2010 (UTC)\n\n:\"Doesn't the fact that you had to create a \"wood bee\" redirect tell you something about how uncommon the term is?\" No. Wikipedia of plenty of such deficiencies. --[[User:Belg4mit|Belg4mit]] ([[User talk:Belg4mit#top|talk]]) 15:24, 18 August 2010 (UTC)\n\n: \"Please see my comments on the talk page there.

This is an automated message to tell you about the gradual phasing out of the preference entitled \"Mark all edits minor by default\", which you currently have (or very recently had) enabled.\n\nOn 13 March 2011, this preference was hidden from the user preferences screen as part of efforts to prevent its accidental misuse ([[Help_talk:Minor_edit#Should_we_remove_the_Preference_setting_to_.22Mark_all_edits_minor_by_default.22_.3F|consensus discussion]]). This had the effect of locking users in to their existing preference, which, in your case, was <code>true<\/code>. To complete the process, your preference will automatically be changed to <code>false<\/code> in the next few days. This does not require any intervention on your part and you will still be able to manually mark your edits as being minor in the usual way. \n\nFor established users such as yourself there is '''[[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(technical)\/Archive_78#Preference_to_mark_all_edits_minor_by_default_asked_to_be_removed_in_bugzilla:24313|a workaround available]]''' involving custom JavaScript.

[[User:Optim|Optim]] 19:29, 19 Dec 2003 (UTC)\n\n:Looks great. I have two suggestions. Firstly I think that anyone using this should put a signed, dated message in the talk page (using <nowiki>~~~~<\/nowiki>) to identify themselves. Second, I think there should be a page (perhaps in the Wikipedia namespace) to which this box links, to provide further explanations and to allow dead boxes to be found and removed, perhaps after a specified time period. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] 20:12, 19 Dec 2003 (UTC)\n\n:: Perhaps [[Wikipedia:Edit conflict]] could be used for the link checking. It doesn't have too many links pointing to it. I agree about the username, but it's difficult in practice -- just adding a sig after the box is ugly, and getting it into the box is non-trivial (the sig macro is not parsed when using transclusion).  The name is always in the page history anyway.[[User:Eloquence|&mdash;Eloquence]]\n\n:great idea, Eloquence! [[User:Noldoaran|&mdash;Noldoaran]] [[User talk:Noldoaran|(Talk)]] 21:32, Dec 19, 2003 (UTC)\n\n: There needs to be a date in that box or next to it.  Too laborious to search the history for when it was included.  Personally I would always include something saying \"The edit is expected to be done by 12\/31\/03\" so that if it's 2005 and another wikipedian sees this, they can feel free to attack.  [[User:Tempshill|Tempshill]] 23:58, 19 Dec 2003 (UTC)\n\n::PS:  I didn't intend to merely complain about this -- thanks, this actually is a good idea.  [[User:Tempshill|Tempshill]] 00:14, 20 Dec 2003 (UTC)\n\n::: Point taken. As I said, it's a bit tricky to include this message in a visually appealing way. But I hope that we will eventually expand the MediaWiki namespace to support parameters, so we can do neat stuff like that. In the meantime, I think going with the history will be enough, because I do not expect this problem (messages left in place) to happen very often. I might be proven wrong, of course.[[User:Eloquence|&mdash;Eloquence]]\n\nWhat a terrible idea.  When did an article become the sole possession of a single editor? [[User:RickK|RickK]] 06:11, 20 Dec 2003 (UTC)\n\n:I can see definite disadvantages to it. People putting it on during an edit war to stop their version being reverted for example, or leaving it for hours, if not days, and going mad when someone removes it. If it's just a few minutes, then perhaps that's ok, but I think encouraging people to edit offline or use the preview button is a better solution. [[User:Angela|Angela]][[User talk:Angela|.]] 06:21, 20 Dec 2003 (UTC)\n\n\n::Some of those concerns are easily adressed. Have a guideline that only a page with no significant dispute be eligible for this msg. Frex talk pages should always be fair game for the msg while archiving. I remember trying to archive a page despite some half a dozen edit conflicts with the user who originally requested the archiving (I won't say who, but you are free to speculate), and the file was 'bout 90k at that. Also have a clear guideline that complying with the request is a purely a courtesy, and not even a at the level of a recommendation. -- [[User:Cimon avaro|Jussi-Ville Heiskanen]] 12:55, Dec 21, 2003 (UTC)\n\n:::90kb talk page. Hmmm. Now where could that be? ;) I think if those points are made clear then this notice shouldn't cause any problems. [[User:Angela|Angela]][[User talk:Angela|.]] 13:09, 21 Dec 2003 (UTC)\n\n::::Actually it was [[Talk:Jesus]]. -- [[User:Cimon avaro|Jussi-Ville Heiskanen]] 11:45, Dec 22, 2003 (UTC)\n\n: Thanks for your feedback, Rick. This is not about making articles the possession of an editor, it is about the times when someone is about to make major changes or rearrangements in an article, and wants to avoid the tedious and annoying edit conflict tool -- for himself and for anyone else working on the article. I'm sure you are familiar with that problem.\n\n: Many wikis implement this technically, by either showing a warning message or locking articles that have been recently opened for editing. I consider it better to use a \"soft\" solution that can be ignored when needed.\n\n: We should perhaps make clear somewhere the appropriate time limit for using this message, and that it can be ignored in cases of controversial edits.[[User:Eloquence|&mdash;Eloquence]]\n\n: A good idea, despite the real reservations expressed. Recently, I've been adding a note to talk pages and a link to the rewrite in progress in my user namespace when undertaking major rewrites. I do this to invite contributions to the rewrite as much as a notification. So far, nobody seems to respond, although I've been working in the relatively uncontroversial area of \"high culture\", which may explain that. I like the idea of putting something on the actual article page, but feel it might be good to add an invitation to communicate with the poster so as to possibly contribute to the rewrite? If an article is so controversial that such an invitation might cause problems, then the notice probably shouldn't be there in the first place. [[User:Bmills|Bmills]] 11:56, 22 Dec 2003 (UTC)\n\n==Why it is here==\nI created the ''inuse'' message because there were times when I needed a few minutes to finish an update to an article and didn't want someone else changing it while I was working on it.  Take a look, for example, at [[List of television stations in USA by Call Sign]] and if I'm putting all of the entries for, say,  [[California]] in from the current list by states, that's going to take a while.  If someone else comes in and changes the list (for [[Colorado]] for example) while I'm doing an edit as well, then my work is wasted or at least I have to now go in and re-edit to include their changes, since the list is in alphabetical order.  In this sort of circumstance I don't really want to put a few entries in, save it, then put more in, and so on, I'd prefer to put all of them in as one batch.  I'm less likely to items out if I do it that way.  (Yes, I wrote that last sentence with the intentionally missing word to see if someone would notice.)\n\nSomeone else came along and seriously improved the appearance of the message.  It is intended for a temporary warning that a change which takes several minutes to do is in progress.  If there was a way to have it automatically time-stamped with the time it was saved so someone could know if it had been there 'too long' and thus know it should be considered no longer in effect, that would have been a good idea.  Perhaps it needs a time limit, say, 30 minutes to an hour at most.  Or it needs to have the time it was posted added.  I think I'll fix it to do that.\n-- Paul  [[User:Rfc1394|Rfc1394]] 17:50, 15 Jan 2004 (UTC)\n\nAs noted above, I have since added four new items, so there is now '''<nowiki>{{msg:inuse30}}<\/nowiki>''' at [[Template:Inuse30]] for 30 minutes, '''<nowiki>{{msg:inuse60}}<\/nowiki>''' at [[Template:Inuse60]] for one hour, '''<nowiki>{{msg:inuse90}}<\/nowiki>''' at [[Template:Inuse90]] for 90 minutes, and '''<nowiki>{{msg:inuse120}}<\/nowiki>''' at [[Template:Inuse120]] for two hours, if you only want a short delay message. -- Paul [[User:Rfc1394|Rfc1394]] 19:41, 15 Jan 2004 (UTC)\n\n: I would think that a more generally useful message would not include predictions of how long the article will be occupied with it.  Instead, it would simply say that the message will be removed when the dust settles.  [[User:Mkmcconn|Mkmcconn]] 20:59, 16 Feb 2004 (UTC)\n----\nJengod reverted with the message\n:''Reverted to the lurid, and there more effective, green''\n\nThere has been no evidence at all that the non-lurid version has been ineffective. Why would people ignore the message if it is simply in bold font, but decide \"oh no I really had better not edit the article\" if it has dotted red box around it. It doesn't make sense to me. \n\nI can't imagine what an impression a first-time reader of Wikipedia gets if they see such a fragrant use of colour. [[User:Pcb21|Pete\/Pcb21]] [[User_talk:Pcb21|(talk)]] 08:08, 19 Mar 2004 (UTC)\n:The use of color is valuable in distiguishing administrative notices from running text. The very purpose of the inuse alert, it seems to me, is to prevent confusion. Another use of color, albeit not so lurid, is <nowiki>{{vfd}}<\/nowiki>. Could we perhaps settle on a less lurid green, or something generally less blantant, will retaining some color and the box? [[User:Jengod|jengod]] 08:20, Mar 19, 2004 (UTC)\n\n::Well I guess at the heart of my gripe is the idea of having admin notices on the article page at all, but more people want them than don't, so I should learn to live with it. Yes a more neutral colour scheme, like the current vfd one (although there is discontent about even that at [[MediaWiki_talk:VfD]]), would be a good way of compromising.

It was reverted with the suggestion that the changes did not assume good faith. I disagree with the revert for the following reasons:\n\n# Assuming good faith doesn't mean ''not'' explaining how this template can be properly used. \n# The template is often misused by editors (presumably acting in good faith) who leave long term locks on pages\n# Editors leave this template on pages presumably because they do not understand that here at WP we do not lightly ask others not to edit, and because they believe the text of the default template authorizes them to have sole control of the article\n# Because the encyclopedia has relevant guidelines and policies, it seems appropriate to provide links to these (as many other templates do) for the information of the adding editor and to encourage them to remove the template when appropriate.\n# The information is also of use to others who come across the template on a page and can then decide whether to go ahead and edit or not, or even remove the tag if it has been forgotten.\n\nBad faith means \"deliberate attempt to harm Wikipedia\". And there was no hint of that in my original message. However, I have tried to soften them and have replaced them. It would be appreciated if you would edit the text to improve it if you should feel it is required. -- [[User:Cmh|cmh]] 00:31, 21 May 2006 (UTC)\n\n:A lot of times, this template is either forgotten and stays up indefinently, or worse yet people really do use it to \"reserve\" an article for them suposedly to edit exclusively for weeks at a time. That's simply not what this template is for... so I've been trying to go through and remove it if it's clearly not being used as intended. Like you I think they're acting in good faith... they just really probably don't understand the implications of article ownership and leaving this tag up for a long time.\n:That said, mentioning [[WP:OWN]] in the template might be a bit too preachy, but I like the current version and think it might avoid some misunderstandings.

As I see it, the template and its instructions can be divided into the \"outward facing\" elements and the \"inward facing\" elements.  The \"outward facing\" part is the included template, which is likely to be seen by casual readers and editors wandering by the article; it should contain instructions that will be of use for them if they want to make changes to the article, or if they wonder if they can remove the template.  The \"inward facing\" part is the [[WP:LOCK]] page and the instructions on this Template page, which are likely to be seen by people who are placing the template; these should contain instructions on how to use the template, for the benefit of those putting it in place.  --[[User:Robth|Robth]]<sup>[[User Talk:Robth|Talk]]<\/sup> 00:53, 29 May 2006 (UTC)\n:::I'm in agreement regarding the language as well as the \"outward facing\" and \"inward facing\" elements.

I like the preservation of the subtext as we got it to last week. The key points for me in the subtext are instructions to the current editor to remove after their editing session, and also a link to WP:OWN that can be referenced if the editor really is trying to camp on the article. I also strongly like the general \"if it hasn't been touched in a while\" rather than trying to determine a specific length of time. Most of the cases of inuse \"left on\" are pretty obvious. -- [[User:Cmh|cmh]] 01:23, 29 May 2006 (UTC)\n:As I noted above, I think the reference to [[WP:OWN]] is more of an \"inward facing\" thing, which a problem editor can be directed to on this template page if needed.  That said, my preference isn't so strong that I'd be greatly upset if we end up keeping that in the included bit.  A general instead of specific time reference sounds good to me, as long as it seems relative clear that we mean \"a while\" in the sense of hours, not weeks (and thinking about it, the \"one editing session\" thing pretty much takes care of that). --[[User:Robth|Robth]]<sup>[[User Talk:Robth|Talk]]<\/sup> 01:33, 29 May 2006 (UTC)\n\nI have implimented the suggestions above.

Not quite at GA level yet, but almost there. First, the quick version:\n:'''[[Wikipedia:Good article nominations|GA]] review''' (see [[Wikipedia:What is a good article?|here]] for criteria)\n#It is '''reasonably well written'''.\n#:a ''(prose)'': {{GAList\/check|wtf}} b ''([[Wikipedia:Manual of Style|MoS]])'': {{GAList\/check|aye}}\n#It is '''factually accurate''' and '''[[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiable]]'''.\n#:a ''(references)'': {{GAList\/check|aye}} b ''(citations to reliable sources)'': {{GAList\/check|aye}} c ''([[Wikipedia:No original research|OR]])'': {{GAList\/check|aye}}\n#It is '''broad in its coverage'''.\n#:a ''(major aspects)'': {{GAList\/check|aye}} b ''(focused)'': {{GAList\/check|aye}}\n#It follows the '''[[WP:NPOV|neutral point of view]] policy'''.\n#:a ''(fair representation)'': {{GAList\/check|aye}} b ''(all significant views)'': {{GAList\/check|aye}}\n#It is '''stable'''.\n#:{{GAList\/check|aye}}\n#It '''contains [[Wikipedia:Images|images]]''', where possible, to illustrate the topic.\n#:a ''(tagged and captioned)'': {{GAList\/check|aye}} b ''lack of images (does not in itself exclude GA)'': {{GAList\/check|aye}} c ''(non-free images have [[Wikipedia:Image_description_page#Use_rationale|fair use rationales]])'': {{GAList\/check|}}\n#'''Overall''': \n#:a ''Pass\/Fail'': {{GAList\/check|nay}}\n\n===Suggestions===\nThe main problem with this article is the prose. While it is generally possible to understand the gist of the article, there are a lot of grammatical errors that need to be fixed. The article is in desperate need of a copyedit; perhaps ask at the [[WP:LoCE|League of Copyeditors]] for some assistance. Some specific points (note that this does not encompass every prose-related issue, but is just a starting point):\n#Is it \"Il-76\" or \"IL-76\"? Both versions are used in the article text. If both are correct, use the capital L as the former can look like \"II\" (two capital i's). If only one version is correct, make sure that there is consistency.\n#There are a number of occurrences of ambiguous pronoun references that need to be fixed.\n#The Background section talks about two plane crashes, but switches between them; better organization is needed.\n#Avoid conjunction repetition, especially in the same sentence: \"''...then separated from the main fuselage of the aircraft and plunged into the Indian Ocean, '''whilst''' the rest of the plane flew along the beach at a low altitude '''whilst''' on fire before crashing.''\"\n#There is no consistency for date formatting. I suggest using the full date for each (ie. [[March 24]] [[2007]]), and remember to wikilink it.\n\nWhile the article is very well cited, there are problems with specific references: #5 is a broken link, and #14 gives a server not found error. Also, while not critical, it would be good to eventually replace the references that do not use a cite template with one that does. \n\nMy final concern, though again not critical, is the title. It's overly wordy where I'm not sure it needs to be. This isn't a GA failing point, but something to consider.\n\n===Conclusion===\n*Article in heavy need of copyediting.\n*A couple broken refs should be fixed.\n\nAs such, I have put the GA nomination '''on hold for one week''', pending repairing the above, which I think is doable. Once the fixes have been made, I'd be glad to approve the article for GA. &mdash;[[User:Dvandersluis|Daniel Vandersluis]]<sup>([[User talk:Dvandersluis|talk]])<\/sup> 19:10, 23 April 2007 (UTC)\n\n==Copy edit, first pass==\nIn response to the above, I'm taking a swipe at the copyedit. Some notes:\n*The title is indeed wordy, and will be fixed following the copyedits to conform with aircraft accident standards\n*The correct designation is I(capital i)l{small L)-76.\n*I've moved the text pertaining to the second aircraft to its own section, as it's not directly relevant to the shootdown, and to clarify things.\n*As the cause is alleged, but not concluded, to have been a shootdown, I'm making adjustments in the text to that affect\n*I've converted the altitude figures to feet, rather than meters, as this is the international aviation standard\n*The second paragraph of the \"shootdown\" section, that dealt with the wreckage and dead, was moved up to the overview section\n*The \"background\" header was renamed \"overview\", a standard for aircraft accident articles.\n*I've removed the \"one of the largest in the world\" claims, as the wikiarticle on the aircraft doesn't make such a claim\n*Redundant statments were removed from the \"aftermath\" section.\n\nI would appreciate it if additional feedback is provided, and I'll address any new concerns.[[User:Akradecki|Akradecki]] 20:34, 23 April 2007 (UTC)\n\n:Overall, a pretty good copyedit.

Consider the following:\n:** Retitle the first paragraph of Overview as \"Flight overview\". Remove the last half of the last sentence (\", and their bodies were later flown back to Belarus.\") for now. Move Previous shootdown attempt to be a subsection of this section, and tie it into the scope of the article (ie. why the previous flight is relevant to this flight -- because they were carrying supplies).\n:** Create a new section called Crash or something alike. In it, describe chronologically the relevant sections of the flight (The first sentence of Shootdown, and \"Just before the crash...\" to the end of the section). Add the second paragraph from Overview. Add timing information if available and relevant. \n:** Create a new section called Alleged shootdown. Include the information about the alleged shootdown from Shootdown and elsewhere. Perhaps add\/move some information about Somalia's response to the claim.\n:** The Reactions and aftermath is good where it is. Unless you choose to move some information about Somalia's response to the previous section as detailed above, there is nothing really needed to be changed here. Integrate the removed sentence from the Overview section about the bodies being flown home.\n:* Article completely re-organised.

[[User:Akradecki|Akradecki]] 21:47, 28 April 2007 (UTC)\n\n==10,000 ft or 500 ft...==\n{{tl|contradict}}\nThe article mentions the pilot informing ATC of a suspected fire in number 2 at 10,000. Later it says witnesses saw a SAM hit it 500 feet off the ground. It seems unlikely in the extreme that the aircrew would not have noticed being hit. I'm inclined to think the 10,000 feet figure is incorrect, as the article says \"just after take off while at 10,000 feet...\". 100 feet sounds more plausible for the term just after takeoff being applied to a large cargo plane, but 1000 seems realistic too. [[User:Anynobody|Anynobody]] 05:17, 1 July 2007 (UTC)\n\n:I don't believe it to contradict at all. I mean, if a plane was struck by a missile at 500ft on takeoff, and hit the engine or nearby (which it likely did), causing engine fire warnings, there's a good chance the crew would believe something had 'gone bang' (geting technical, isn't it ;-) inside the engine itself, in which case they would be quite keen to just shut the engine down, pull the corresponding extuinguisher handle and attempt to fly on. 10,000ft and still burining... time to get back. The likely reason for the structural failure was, IMO, not directly the SAM strike, but the subsequent fire weakening the wing structure. I'll go ask the rest of the Air Crash Task Force for their opinions. [[User:Blood Red Sandman|<font color=\"red\">'''Blood Red Sandman'''<\/font>]] <sup>[[User talk:Blood Red Sandman|<font color=\"red\">(Talk)<\/font>]]  [[Special:Contributions\/Blood Red Sandman|<font color=\"red\">(Contribs)<\/font>]]<\/sup> 10:29, 1 July 2007 (UTC)\n\nI appreciate your point, and actually had considered a similar scenario but after considering the following points I changed my mind. Most importantly, even on four engines, it takes a few minutes for an [[Il-76]] to reach 10,000 feet (by a few I mean around 5 - 10 at the extreme). A plane like a F-15, Su-27, or Tornado is a different story, but cargo planes (especially if they're carrying cargo) don't climb very fast. The article mentions a fire warning at 10,000 and their intention to turn around for an emergency landing, in general the only time a pilot would proceed after an engine fire is during war or other special circumstances. This is because if the extinguisher doesn't put out the fire, the other three good engines won't help when the fuel tank explodes once the fire spreads to it. For the article to be correct, the aircraft would have been hit at 500 feet or several minutes before achieving ~10,000 and then having a fire break out, it sounds implausible. The damaged engine would either fail or indicate abnormal functioning, which I admit the crew might have missed, but image what a jet engine knocked out of balance must sound like. (If you're having difficulty, image how much louder your washing machine sounds when it's off balance compared to normal then scale the noise up several times.) Also, and this occurred to me as I typed, besides the engine there are hydraulic system lines\/components in the wing and fuel tanks\/lines. If it was hit by a missile, chances are some kind of fluid(s) were also leaking. Which should've attracted the attention of the crew sooner. [[User:Anynobody|Anynobody]] 11:47, 1 July 2007 (UTC)\n\nHmmm.... If the engine died completely, though, they wouldn't have much chance to feel the fact that it was shaking their plane apart (an even better indicater, or so I believe, than the horrendous noise these things must make in trouble) because it wouldn't be; the same for noise. If we assume for the moment it was a heat-seeking missile, there's a good chance it scored a direct hit on the engine, thus preventing fuel leaks etc since fluid would only be dribbling out of the engine, and there are quick procedures to cut all this stuff from a failed engine in seconds. However, I'm not beyond spoting that that presents us an altogether different problem: is it possible that the drag of the failed engine was not sufficient to cause concern? As you say, big cargo planes climb real slow, so would 500ft be high enough for the autopilot to be on by that point and, if they shut the engine down quick enough for the autopilot not to cut out, is it possible that the drag was within compensatory limits for the autopilot, thus preventing the crew from realising the full seriousness of the situation and possible even causing them to ignore\/disbelieve other warnings in the cockpit? Such confusion has been seen before in airliner cockpits, although no case comes close to the circumstances of this one. That said, very few such accidents are similar to each other, either, and it seems a potentialy realistic scenario... I don't know. Comments?

Witnesses all say it was hit at 500 feet and then crashed right after. I clarified that the contradiction comes from two different sources. Looking at a satellite image of the airport\/city, assuming reports of the plane coming down just North of Mogadishu are correct, then the 500 ft hit seems to me more likely. (I'm not gonna put that in the article of course though, [[WP:OR]] would be thrown out the window if I did.)\n\n:My problem was that the article presented both accounts as the same story, and it just didn't make sense. Now that I know the government says one thing and the media reports another, the contradiction becomes more of a controversy (which is acceptable). [[User:Anynobody|Anynobody]] 05:07, 2 July 2007 (UTC)\n\n::[[User:Blood Red Sandman|<font color=\"red\">'''Blood Red Sandman'''<\/font>]] even though I figured out the contradiction, in case you are curious here is what I would have said to continue the technical discussion, again in case you are curious (I don't want to come off as a know it all jackass). If the engine had died completely, right after being hit then shaking\/noise wouldn't be the trouble sign. Instead the instruments for that engine would indicate lower (or no) temp, pressure, and RPM readings after the engine stops running or the sensors are destroyed. This situation would be apparent to the aircrew, assuming they didn't notice the hit itself or the instruments for the engine, by loss of airspeed (A plane with 3\/4 engines isn't going to fly the same.\n\n::On a side note, I'm thinking a RPG was more likely (easily available there, cheap, low altitude, slow speed right after take off, is the best chance they would have and the Somalis seem to know how to hit aircraft with them.) I'll assume you are correct and it was a heat seeking SAM that squarely hit the engine. It would have thrown shrapnel\/debris into the wing, fuselage and probably engine 1 too offering plenty of chances to create leaks, but I'll further assume the shrapnel missed fuel\/hydraulic lines though and use the situation you described with fuel dribbling out of the damaged engine only. To be blunt;\n::# A dribble of jet fuel is still a fuel leak, which is pretty dangerous.\n::# If we assume they didn't notice the hit, they wouldn't have shut off fuel to the engine; resulting in more of a spray than a dribble. [[User:Anynobody|Anynobody]] 05:45, 2 July 2007 (UTC)\n\n::Fair points... Though I was thinking they might shut it down as an engine failure after the SAM took it out without realising the extent of the damage. But no matter; we now know the truth of the aparant contradiction, so I won't go on to develop my next argument further than that... After all, we both know now what the real situation was, and this could go on forever.

[[User:Anynobody|Anynobody]] 05:15, 6 July 2007 (UTC)\n\n:::Certainly, there tends to be at least a bit of media hype about CVRs and FSRs when they are recovered, and I read a lot of news stuff when researching this crash, including a lot of later ones dealing with cause or aftermath that would likely have dealt with the contents of the 'black boxes' had they been recovered... and based on the crash pictures, recovery would not have been a particularly difficult issue.

Many military transports don't use them, and keep in mind that in the old Soviet days, the line between a military transport and a civilian airliner were often quite blurred...Aeroflot was everything. So in the aftermath of the fall of communism and the rise of \"real\" civilian airlines, and their use of what are essentially military transports, like the Il-76, they didn't have the regulations or budget to do such expensive upgrades like CVRs and FDRs. Of course, that limits their routes. No doubt that's why (i.e. meeting more stringent FAA regs for aircraft and equipment) the Aeroflot Moscow-Los Angeles run uses an American-made 767! '''[[User:Akradecki|<font style=\"color:#62BB32;\">AK<font style=\"color:#006400;\">Radecki<\/font><\/font>]]'''<sup>[[User_talk:Akradecki|<font style=\"color:#62BB32;\">Speaketh<\/font>]]<\/sup> 13:17, 6 July 2007 (UTC)\n\n:What you're saying makes sense, and explains why one doesn't see Russian owned planes in the states very often. I can't speak for other nations Air Forces\/Naval aviation but I'm pretty sure the US military had been using equipment similar to a CVR for quite a while, and more sure that all US military fixed wing aircraft today have both. (Not so much a safety measure as a way to track what causes the loss of expensive aircraft and monitor performance.)\n\n:The irony is that CVR\/FDR equipment is expensive, but much cheaper than losing aircraft after aircraft due to a defect such equipment might detect. (In addition to answering questions in a case like this of course.)

They were the best thing that ever happened as an aid to stamp collecting, as far as I'm concerned.\n:Any hinges that I can find now are made in Germany, and even though they claim to be pealable, I find it not to be true. I came across about half a pack of Dennisons a while back, when a collector friend died, and her daughter gave me a box of her stamps and stamp supplies. I use them to attach the most valuable of my canceled collection.\n:SO, to anyone who reads this, I am crying for HELP in finding Dennison hinges, OR something as pealable.

The truck driver, who drives a daily freight route from Chicago to St. Louis along the highway where the billboard is located, begins fantasizing about having a relationship with the woman. He also takes note at how many traffic accidents have occurred near the billboard (supposedly due to [[distracted driving|motorists becoming distracted]] by the billboard).\n\nEarly one morning (4:45 AM), while his diesel idles nearby, the trucker knocks on the door of the artist who painted the billboard and (presumably) asks for the model's contact information. The painter curtly tells the trucker that the \"girl wasn't real\" and that he'd \"better get the (censored) on his way.\" (An electric guitar riff is used in place of the [[profanity]]). Disillusioned at his fantasy being ruined, the trucker moans that along the highway, \"You'll find tiny pieces of my heart scattered every which a way.\"\n\n===Cover versions===\nIn 2005, Canadian band [[The Road Hammers]] released a [[cover version]] on its [[The Road Hammers (album)|debut album]].

In June 2009, the unit was absorbed into the newly formed Naval Special Warfare Force (''Fuerza de Guerra Naval Especial''). The UOE, which was formerly garrisoned in the ''Tercio de Armada'' in [[San Fernando, C\u00e1diz]], operated under the direct control of the [[Spanish Navy (Armada Espa\u00f1ola)|Admiralty]] and Naval Special Warfare Command. It was thought to comprise approximately 100 men organized into three Operational Teams (''Estoles'') as well as command and support personnel. \n\nThe UOE was tasked with Special Operations in maritime, coastal and inland environments usually up to 50&nbsp;km from the sea, though this was not a restriction and its teams were known to operate deep inland. The unit's remit covered all aspects of modern Naval Special Warfare, including: Maritime [[Counter-Terrorism]], shipboarding (MIO-Non Compliant), [[frogman|combat diving and swimming]], coastal infiltration, airborne insertion, [[Special Reconnaissance]], [[direct action (military)|Direct Action]], VIP protection and escort, and [[Combat Search and Rescue|Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR)]]. \n\nFor these purposes the UOE employed a wide range of naval and other military platforms, including [[submarines]], [[frigates]], soft- and [[RHIB|rigid-hull]] inflatable boats, land vehicles, as well as helicopters and airplanes for airborne insertions.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Origins of the UOE.jpg|thumb|right|Origins of the UOE. (Source: ''Armada Espa\u00f1ola)]]\n''La Unidad'' (\"The Unit\"), as it was informally known in Spain, traces its roots to the Amphibious Climbing Company (''Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Escaladores Anfibios''), established in 1952 as an all-volunteer unit tasked with [[coast]]al [[assault]]s and [[infiltration tactics|infiltration]]. In 1967, using the [[United States Navy SEALs|US Navy SEALs]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Special Boat Service|SBS]] as its guides,{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} the unit expanded its mandate and range of skills to include [[frogman|combat diving]], [[underwater demolition]]s, [[airborne forces|airborne insertions]] and [[direct action]] [[military operation|missions]]. In 1985 the UOE was re-designated COMANFES (''Comando Anfibio Especial''), but reverted to its original name in the early 1990s. Today, the unit is one of two operational elements within the Spanish Navy's Naval Special Warfare Force.\n\nThe UOE collaborated and trained closely with similar NATO units, such as the [[United States Navy]] [[United States Navy SEALs|SEALs]], the Italian Navy's [[Italian commando frogmen|COMSUBIN]], the French [[French commando frogmen|Commando Hubert]], and the Portuguese  [[Special Actions Detachment|DAE]], as well as with special intervention units of the Spanish police forces ([[Unidad Especial de Intervenci\u00f3n|UEI]] and [[Grupo Especial de Operaciones|GEO]]). \n\nThe UOE and its parent Naval Special Warfare Force are one of only three units in the Spanish military formally tasked with Special Operations, along with the [[Spanish Army|Army's]] [[Special Operations Command (Spain)|MOE]] and the [[Spanish Air Force|Air Force's]] EZAPAC.\n\n==Selection and training==\n[[File:UOE in submarine exercise.JPG|thumb|right|UOE commandos rendezvous with a submarine.]]\nAfter completing [[recruit training|basic training]] and having served in a conventional unit, candidates aspiring to attain the \"green beret\" must undergo comprehensive medical and psychological reviews as well as physical trials, and then, if approved, pass a selection course (''Capacitaci\u00f3n''). The course is divided into ''Basic'' and ''Advanced'' phases and is staffed exclusively by UOE officers and NCOs, all of them fully qualified in special operations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nThe ''Basic'' phase lasts for about four weeks and is aimed at testing the physical and psychological endurance of candidates through a gruelling combination of intense physical exercise, long-distance marches carrying up to 50&nbsp;kg of weight, and numerous trials at sea and in mountain environments. The ''Advanced'' phase of selection lasts for about two months and, though the physical rigor of the course steadily increases, candidates also receive more specific [[training]] in basic naval [[commando|commando skills]]:\n* [[frogman|Combat swimming]] \n* Small-craft [[navigation]]\n* Shipboarding\n* Mountaineering and [[rappelling]]\n* Demolitions\n* [[Marksman]]ship\n* [[Military communications|Communications]]\n* Hostage rescue\n* [[Orienteering]] \n* Escape and evasion in enemy territory\n* Land\/maritime [[survival skills|survival techniques]] \n* Battlefield medicine\n\nCandidates are free to drop out of the course at any moment, from the first day to the last. Though some drop-outs result from physical injury (or even death), most instances are voluntary.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} The attrition rate for the UOE selection process can occasionally be as high as 100% and averages from 70 to 80%\u2014the highest failure rate of any course in the Spanish armed forces. It is not uncommon that by the end of the course the instructor-candidate ratio is 3:1. The unit's harsh entrance criteria have furnished its official motto, \"''Entra quien puede, no quien quiere''\" (\"He who can enters, not he who wants\").\n\nSuccessful candidates are immediately sent to [[parachuting|parachuting school]] upon arrival at the UOE and proceed to more advanced and specialised training in Naval Special Warfare skills (diving, sniping, intelligence, etc.).<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http:\/\/www.armada.mde.es\/ArmadaPortal\/page\/Portal\/ArmadaEspannola\/buques_especiales\/03_UOE|title=UOE official Navy website|accessdate=2008-12-07}}<\/ref>\n\n==Deployments==\n[[File:Sosan seizure Spanish Navy.jpg|thumb|right|UOE team boards North Korean vessel. (Source: ''Armada Espa\u00f1ola)]]\nThe UOE always maintains one of its three operational teams on maximum alert (''Alpha-1'') for immediate deployment on a rotational basis. \n\nThe UOE was first deployed overseas in 1969, just two years after it was founded, when it spearheaded the evacuation of [[Spain|Spanish]] citizens from the former [[Spain|Spanish]] colony of [[Equatorial Guinea]] in [[Africa]]. Since then, the unit has been reported to have participated in the fight against [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] violence inside Spain<ref>''Elite Forces: The World's Most Formidable Secret Armies'', by Richard M. Bennett (London: 2003).<\/ref> (though today this is strictly the preserve of civilian police forces).\n\nMore recently, among its publicly known missions, the UOE was deployed to the former [[Yugoslavia]] as part of the [[Spain|Spanish]] IFOR and SFOR contingents. Also, in December 2002, while participating in [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] in the [[Indian Ocean]], UOE [[commando]]s stormed a suspect [[North Korea]]n vessel, the ''So San'', transporting a shipment of SCUD missiles destined for [[Yemen]].<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2002\/WORLD\/europe\/12\/11\/missile.ship.spain\/index.html|title=Spanish official details high seas drama\n|date=December 11, 2002\n|accessdate=2007-04-25\n| work=CNN}}<\/ref> The unit is also known to have recently deployed its teams on undisclosed missions in the Middle East.\n\nThe UOE is a central element of the [[Spain|Spanish]] Maritime [[Counter-Terrorism]] capability.\n\n==Weapons==\n[[File:UOE-Sea-Ex.jpg|thumb|UOE commandos with German Heckler & Koch [[Heckler & Koch G36|G36KE]] carbines.]]\n\nWeapons held at the UOE armory include, but are not limited to, the following:\n*Sound-suppressed [[SIG Sauer P230]] pistol\n*[[MP5]] submachine gun\n*[[HK G36E]] assault rifle\n*[[HK G36KE]] carbine\n*[[Remington 870]] shotgun\n*[[HK MG4]] light machine gun\n*[[CETME Ameli|Ameli]] light machine gun\n*[[M60 machine gun]]\n*[[MG3]] machine gun\n*[[L96A1|Accuracy AW]] sniper rifle\n*[[Barrett M95]] heavy sniper rifle\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of special forces units]]\n*[[Spanish special operations|Spanish special forces units]]\n*[[Spanish Navy]]\n\n==References==\n<references\/>\n\n==External links==\n*{{es icon}} [http:\/\/www.armada.mde.es\/ArmadaPortal\/page\/Portal\/ArmadaEspannola\/buques_especiales\/03_UOE Official website (Spanish Navy)]\n*{{es icon}} [http:\/\/www.uoe5estol.es UOE veterans website (unofficial)]\n*{{en icon}} [http:\/\/www.shadowspear.com\/spain-special-operations\/unidad-de-operaciones-especiales.html ShadowSpear Special Ops Website (includes UOE video)]\n\n[[Category:Spanish Navy]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations of Spain]]\n[[Category:Special forces of Spain]]","timestamp":"20160410103206","user-timestamp":"20150410103206"},{"title":"User talk:66.209.105.226","content":"hi there! as you can see, I am not a very good person :)\nThe reason that I am a vandal is beceause I am not a person, really.

Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]] \n\nIf you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding <code>{{tl|hangon}}<\/code> to '''the top of [[:Double Income, No Kids Yet|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion or \"db\" tag), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Double Income, No Kids Yet|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

He was educated at the [[London School of Economics]] ([[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] Economics 1965) and at the [[University of London]] (MSc 1967). He became a lecturer at the [[Swansea University|University of Wales, Swansea]] in 1966 and remained there until his election to parliament in 1979.\n\n==Parliamentary career==\nSheerman unsuccessfully contested [[Taunton (UK Parliament constituency)|Taunton]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October 1974 election]], and became the MP for Huddersfield East from 1979 to 1983 and for [[Huddersfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Huddersfield]] since the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]]. Sheerman has held the Huddersfield seats since, with his majority as low as 3,955 in 1983 and as high as 15,848 in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]]. In the most recent general election in [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015]], Sheerman's majority was increased to 7,345 with a swing of 6.1% to Labour.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1988 he was the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] spokesperson on education and employment; for [[Home Affairs]] (as Shadow Deputy [[Home Secretary]]) from 1988 to 1992; and for Disabled People's Rights from 1992 to 1994. He was  Chair of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] Education and Skills [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committee]] from 2001 to 2010, renamed the [[Children, Schools and Families Committee]] in 2007. Under his chairmanship, the Committee was often critical of government policy. Sheerman warned the government not to \"lose their nerve\" over reforming secondary education exam system back in 2005,<ref>{{cite web|title=End A-level 'obsession', says MP|url=http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/education\/4284407.stm|website=BBC|accessdate=7 April 2015}}<\/ref> and in 2006 said it was \"naive\" to allocate local school places through parental choice, with lottery selection being the best way to avoid \"bloody awful\" schools existing as a side effect of parents pushing for their children to study elsewhere.<ref>{{cite news|title=Parental school choice 'naive'|url=http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/uk_news\/education\/5237548.stm|accessdate=7 April 2015|publisher=BBC|date=2 August 2006}}<\/ref> During Sheerman's chairmanship, the select committee produced reports on subjects such as home education, education outside the classroom, and young people not in education employment or training (NEETs).\n\nHe is Chair of the Labour Forum for Criminal Justice and of the Cross-Party Advisory Group on Preparation for European Monetary Union. Outside parliament, he is Chair of the National Educational Research and Development Trust, and a trustee of the [http:\/\/yorkshirechildrenscentre.org.uk\/ National Children's Centre]. His political interests are listed as trade, industry, finance, [[further education]], education, economy, the [[European Union]], [[South America]] and the [[United States]]. His recreations include walking, biography and films. In 1993, Sheerman co-wrote, with Isaac Kramnick, a biography of the Labour intellectual [[Harold Laski]].\n\nIn June 2009, Sheerman called for a secret ballot of the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]] on whether [[Gordon Brown]] should continue in office as prime minister. This followed widespread criticism of Brown's performance and the resignation of Cabinet member [[James Purnell]]. Sheerman later reassured his local party chairman that he had not directly called for Brown's resignation.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http:\/\/www.examiner.co.uk\/news\/local-west-yorkshire-news\/2009\/06\/06\/huddersfield-mp-sheerman-called-to-account-by-local-party-members-86081-23804506\/| title = Huddersfield MP Sheerman called to account by local party members| author = Gibson, Barry| date = 6 June 2009| accessdate = 6 June 2009\n| publisher = The Huddersfield Daily Examiner}}<\/ref> \n\nSheerman called for a London catering company to employ \"British workers\" in a [[Twitter]] exchange on 23 April 2012.<ref>Barry Gibson [http:\/\/www.examiner.co.uk\/news\/local-west-yorkshire-news\/2012\/04\/25\/huddersfield-mp-barry-sheerman-demands-british-jobs-for-british-workers-after-disappointing-bacon-buttie-86081-30832588\/ \"Huddersfield MP Barry Sheerman demands British jobs for British workers after disappointing bacon buttie\"], ''Huddersfield Daily Examiner'', 25 April 2012<\/ref> The comments reached the national press.

If the articles exist then link to them, if not they can't be proven as fact and should not be included\n2.

Maybe it's a trifling distinction, but Meier and Dahl did not \"reunite\" in the complete sense of the word. Meier stopped by Dahl's remote broadcast. There's no reason (yet) to think they're getting back together. If I'm wrong, please feel free to correct, but please also support with sources. - [[User:Chabuhi|Chabuhi]] 23:35, 18 August 2006 (UTC)\n\nI find comments like \"...Now that the two work in the same building, it has fueled speculation that Steve and Garry will be reunited permanently (perhaps even making a return to morning drive)....\" to be questionable.

[[User:WinSmith|WinSmith]] 16:25, 17 July 2007 (UTC)\n\n== Inconsitancies in Name Usage ==\n\nThe article variously refers to the subjects by their first names, nick names and last names.  For the casual reader who is not intimately familiar with the personalities discussed, reading the article becomes a dreary scroll up to find out WTF is Steve, or which is Garry and WTH is this other guy.  Last names are best when discussing multiple people.  Clean it up. don't assume all the readers are from Detroit or Michigan or wherever these two jocks are from since these personalities are linked from other articles relating to sports incidents.  Be consistent please.\n\n== WCKG Ratings ==\n\n\"The fate of both Dahls has recently been called into question as WCKG's ratings keep them in the cellar of Chicago radio, tied for 28th with a paltry 1.2 share.

Every one of this user's edits has been to this article, and most have been about WCKG's ratings, which is neither encyclopedic nor important to the biography of Steve Dahl.

[[User:Betaeleven|Betaeleven]] 03:25, 3 October 2007 (UTC)\n\n:If the station's poor ratings and imminent format change are not wiki-worthy then neither is the self-aggrandizing bloviating about ratings that was previously posted. This is not intended to be an advertisment for Mr. Dahl, but rather a factual encyclopedic presentation. This entire entry is so biased it does a disservice to wikipedia.  <small>\u2014Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Chicago1919|Chicago1919]] ([[User talk:Chicago1919|talk]] \u2022 [[Special:Contributions\/Chicago1919|contribs]]) 04:11, 3 October 2007 (UTC)<\/small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\n\n::You're comparing apples to oranges. Steve Dahl's ratings have been, and continue to be, good. The rest of the station's are arguably not good. Thus, it is on-topic for an article about Steve Dahl to include information about his ratings, but it is irrelevant to discuss the ratings of the rest of the station. You don't see an article about 30 Rock discussing the ratings of Scrubs just because both are on NBC. [[User:WinSmith|WinSmith]] 16:59, 3 October 2007 (UTC)\n\n::: It looks like we'll agree to disagree. Steve's ratings are not good. To say you are fifth in the male 25-54 demo in the afternoon drive slot is to say nothing. He's beaten by both sports talk stations in town. His advertisers range from a mortgage broker to a limo company with no real consumer brands to speak of and station revenues underscore this. To the extent that ratings are perceived as \"good\" by anyone, the imminent arrival of Danny Bonaduce will be a rude awakening. Lets keep references to ratings out of the wiki as they are dynamic and they generally don't support the advertising\/promotion efforts of this particularly biased wikipedia entry.--[[User:Chicago1919|Chicago1919]] 17:37, 3 October 2007 (UTC)\n\n::I don't have a problem with Steve's personal ratings being in the article (good or bad), however WCKG's ratings as a whole have no place in here nor does speculation on what might happen to the station regardless of the source.  [[User:Jauerback|Jauerback]] 14:54, 4 October 2007 (UTC)\n\n:If there is an imminent format change at CKG it is certainly pertinent to an article about Dahl's life and career.--[[User:RWR8189|RWR8189]] 03:49, 3 October 2007 (UTC)\n\n::I refer you to: [[WP:NOT#CRYSTAL]] and [[WP:NOT#NEWS]].

This information is certainly notable and has a place in this article--[[User:RWR8189|RWR8189]] 04:40, 3 October 2007 (UTC).\n\n::::Ratings go up and down constantly. People have been predicting WCKG's demise for at least 6 years. Furthermore, my opinions about the reliability of the Sun-Times aside, we're talking about a column not a news article. The columnist in question is frequently wrong, and has shown a clear bias against the subjects. [[User:WinSmith|WinSmith]] 16:55, 3 October 2007 (UTC)\n\n::::RWR, why are you bringing up the [[WP:RS|reliable source]] info anyway?  I never questioned that.

[[User:Jauerback|Jauerback]] 18:57, 4 October 2007 (UTC)\n\nParsnip, your edits have been good. However, I think the fact that syndication failed is an important part of the record and should be included. This is as good of a place as any to put it as it was controversial in nature.  <small>\u2014Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Chicago1919|Chicago1919]] ([[User talk:Chicago1919|talk]] \u2022 [[Special:Contributions\/Chicago1919|contribs]]) 00:08, 9 October 2007 (UTC)<\/small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\n:I don't necessarily object to including information about the failed syndication, but I don't think it's really a controversial topic (certainly not in the same realm as Dahl taping coworkers). If anything, we should restructure it to add a new main head \"Radio Career\", and then include a few subheads underneath it that represent the linear nature of the whole career. Agree? Disagree? Thoughts? Additionally, calling it \"ill-fated\" is POV and OR. [[User:The Parsnip!|The Parsnip!]] 01:11, 9 October 2007 (UTC)\n:I've readded the bit with some editing, and restuctured. [[User:The Parsnip!|The Parsnip!]] 01:17, 9 October 2007 (UTC)\n\nParsnip, given your undying advocacy of the subject of this wikipedia entry I assume you are in some way working for Mr. Dahl. In fact, I assume that you are Mark Czerniec, Dahl's webmaster and otherwise flunky. No, I guess CBS reformatted WCKG because of the HIGH ratings. This wiki entry is a completely biased advertisement for the subject and in no way an objective entry, mainly because of you and, no doubt, Dahl, himself. --[[User:Chicago1919|Chicago1919]] 14:26, 4 November 2007 (UTC)\n\n:Um, have you read [[WP:NPA]]? I recommend you do so. Also, I am not this Mark person, and I don't know who he is. No, I don't work for Dahl. What I am is a concerned Wikipedian who won't sit here while you continually insert weasel words, POV and garbage into this article with your single-purpose account. I think you should give up your crusade to insert negative POV into this article without any independent reliable citations. YOU don't know WHY WCKG decided to restructure, it could be for a multitude of reasons. Saying that they did it because of bad ratings is speculation, and speculation is [[WP:OR]]. [[User:The Parsnip!|Nobody of consequence]] 17:20, 4 November 2007 (UTC)\n\n:Chicago1919, I have to completely disagree with you.  Parsnip's edits have been great:  very balanced and informed.  On the other hand, I don't believe you've had a single edit that hasn't been pushing a POV and full of weasel words.  In fact, you haven't touched a non-WCKG article.  One could easily accuse of you of the very same thing.  You really should read the links that Parsnip provided you.  Maybe they will give you some insight on how Wikipedia works and how an article should look.  [[User:Jauerback|Jauerback]] 22:02, 4 November 2007 (UTC)\n\n::For both of you to use the term \"weasel words\" when chastising me for referencing facts regarding ratings and the reason for the format change as stated by Dahl, himself, tells me a lot. I am not stating POV, I am stating fact. I now understand that you view Wikipedia as a sort of Yellow Pages for advertisement and not fact. Thanks for the education.--[[User:71.239.5.116|71.239.5.116]] 22:13, 4 November 2007 (UTC)\n\n:::Let's try some further explaining.  I have no problem with you putting any controversies in the article about Dahl.  Earlier, you had put something about him not making the Radio Hall of Fame.  I'm not sure why that's not in there anymore, but I doubt that you removed it.  Here's a link to a reference:\n\n:::http:\/\/findarticles.com\/p\/articles\/mi_qn4155\/is_20060808\/ai_n16662475\n\n:::However, when you use a line like, \"Also in 2006, ''this self-described legend'' did not garner enough votes to make it into the Radio Hall of Fame\", (the italics are my own) is considered [[WP:WEASEL|weasal words]] (have you read that link, yet?).\n\n:::Another example: \"...ratings ''keep them in the cellar'' of Chicago radio, tied for 28th with a ''paltry'' 1.2 share...\" (italics mine) are other examples of weasel words that are totally [[POV]] and not necessary to the article. \n\n:::Third example: \"...WCKG's ''long-awaited'' format change was unveiled...\" (italics my own).  Even with sources, this doesn't belong in an article about Steve Dahl.\n\n:::Final example. Why was this change of yours necessary?  From this:  \"Dahl announced on October 29, 2007 that he will move to mornings at WJMK on November 5 as WCKG changes formats...\" to this: \"...Dahl himself, ''lamented WCKG's poor ratings and resultant limited marketing resources as well as the fact that a reformatting of the station was forthcoming''\" (italics my own, again)  Do you not see the weasel words that you are using?\n \n:::Now as an example of \"positive\" weasel-words (and these are not yours) are \"He is considered a pioneer in talk radio...\", however that line now has two sources to back it up.  Without the sources, this line wouldn't belong either.\n\n:::Putting ratings information about Dahl is okay, but about the overall station that he is (now was) on has nothing to do about Dahl.  WCKG's rating belong in the [[WCKG]] article. Look at this way, ten years from now, is anyone going to care about what the ratings of WCKG were when they're reading about Steve Dahl?  No.  For example, are the station ratings necessary for this important line in the article:\n\n:::\"Less than a year later, WDAI changed formats to [[disco]] and fired Dahl on [[Christmas Eve]], 1978.\"\n\n:::No, except that the station changed formats and Dahl was fired, but I'm sure that WDAI's format change had something to do about the ratings of WDAI (and even Dahl's), but it's not important to this article.\n\n:::Oh, and according to the following line from the [http:\/\/www.chicagotribune.com\/business\/chi-tue_wckg_1106nov06,0,7636706.story November 6th Phil Rosenthal article], his ratings were apparently not all that bad:  \"While Dahl remained a reliable draw, WCKG struggled...\"\n\n:::It's obvious that you're neither a Dahl fan nor a WCKG fan, however I won't speculate why that is.  As I said before, every one of your edits has been to add negative information to WCKG-related articles.  That's a bit [[Wikipedia:Single-purpose account|single-purpose]], don't you think?  We need balance to the article, yes, but you're going a bit overboard.

These militia revivals believed in the sanctity of the U.S. Constitution, and that certain groups are conspiring to destroy America.

He was born on 14 October 1891 in [[Villarrica, Paraguay|Villarrica]] and died on 5 January 1988 in [[Asunci\u00f3n]]. He was one of the founders of the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]]. He was the son of Norberta Ramos and Eleuterio Gim\u00e9nez, and was born in Villarrica, of [[Espiritu Santo|el Espiritu Santo]], in the [[Guair\u00e1 Department]]. He married Ina Rol\u00f3n with whom he produced children.\n\n==Education==\nRamos Gim\u00e9nez began studying and writing with [[Manuel Ortiz Guerrero]]. They were companions, they  went to school together, sitting in the same bench. He also interacted with [[Juan Natalicio Gonz\u00e1lez]], who would become one of his loyal friends. From an early age he had already stood out as a promising prose writer, poet and one of the first literaries with socialist ideology in contemporary Paraguay. At various periods he lived in [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]].\n\n==Literary career==\nRamos Gim\u00e9nez began writing in the newspapers of his native city. Then in 1914, he sent some contributions to the literary magazine \"Chronicle\". A few months before he had appeared in the April 1913 edition of ''Asunci\u00f3n Estaba''. His contributions to the literary magazine were short-lived as the magazine was closed down in less than two years. The first collaboration was signed with the acronym: L. R. J. and was published in the \"Correos\" section of the magazine. It was entitled: ''La cumbre del Titan'' (The summit of the Titan). This is a moving elegy on the Aeschylean path of Mcal. L\u00f3pez, when he timidly began the campaign for the vindication of his image.\n\n===Works===\nHe major works include the following:\n* ''Piras sagradas'', Asunci\u00f3n, 1917 - (Sacred pyres)\n* ''Eros, Asunci\u00f3n'', 1918 - (Eros)\n* ''Alas y sombras'', Buenos Aires, 1919 - (Wings and shadows)\n* ''Cantos del solar heroico'', Asunci\u00f3n, 1920 - (Heroic songs of the sun)\n* ''Canto a las palmeras de R\u00edo de Janeiro'', R\u00edo de Janeiro, 1932. - (Song of the palms of Rio de Janeiro) Collection of de verses.\n* ''Tabla de sangre'', libro de combate, contra el r\u00e9gimen de esclavitud imperante en los yerbales y obrajes del Alto Paran\u00e1, Asunci\u00f3n, 1919 - (Table of blood, book of combat against the regime of slavery prevailing in the mate plantations  mills of Alto Parana)\n* ''La bestia blanca'', Asunci\u00f3n, 1919 - (The white beast)\n* ''En el centenario del mariscal L\u00f3pez'', pol\u00e9mica hist\u00f3rica, San Pablo, 1927 - (In the centenary of Marshal L\u00f3pez, historical controversy)\n* ''La yerba mate'', Asunci\u00f3n, 1931 - (The yerba matte)\n* ''El Brasil, su desarrollo econ\u00f3mico-industrial'', R\u00edo de Janeiro, 1932 - (Brazil, its economic and industrial development)\n* ''Siembra blanca'', campa\u00f1a de aproximaci\u00f3n paraguayo-brasilera, R\u00edo de Janeiro, 1932 - (White Sowing, Paraguayan-Brazilian campaign approach)\n* ''El hierro y otros metales en el Paraguay'' - (Iron and other metals in Paraguay)\n* ''Historia cartogr\u00e1fica del Chaco'', Buenos Aires, 1935 - (Cartographic history of the Chaco)\n* ''El Chaco Boreal en la historia y en nuestros d\u00edas'', Buenos Aires, 1934 - (The Boreal Chaco in history and today)\n\nFor theatre he wrote:\n''La inquisici\u00f3n del oro'' (The Inquisition of gold), a drama in three acts and two frames released in the National Theater of the Assumption. The main idea was to raise awareness about the rights of the working masses. It was performed by a cast of amateurs, where the protagonist was himself the author of the work.\n\nOther diverse works are to be added to the above lists as they have come to light in the Asuncion, Buenos Aires, Montevideo and Rio de Janeiro press.\n\n==Journalistic career==\nIn the press, Ramos Gim\u00e9nez directed several newspapers and magazines. In 1913 he founded and directed the fortnightly magazine \"New Era\" and \"Prometheus\" in the following  year. This would be one of the several vocalizers of organized labor in [[Paraguay]].\n\nHe founded, along with P. Alejandro Islas the weekly ''Acci\u00f3n Paraguaya'' (Paraguayan Action) which was widely publicized, but unfortunately short lived. Its main purpose was to defend the interests of Paraguay on the occasion of the peace conference whose deliberations were met at that time in the late 1920s.\n\nDuring 1925 ''Numancia'', ''Patria'', ''Paraguay'' and ''Progreso Nacional'' were created. In 1930 he edited \"Journal of the Military Health System: Annals of Paraguay.\"\n\nIn 1929 he founded the newspaper ''El Censor'' and \"La Uni\u00f3n'', the latter again in 1933. In 1934  he created the newspapers: ''Uni\u00f3n Nacional'' and ''Estrella''.\n\nHe founded, in 1940, the ''Compa\u00f1\u00eda Editorial Paraguaya'' (Paraguayan Publishing Company), successor to the ''Compa\u00f1\u00eda Editora Nacional'' (National Publishing Company), also created by him.\n\n==Political career==\nRamos Gim\u00e9nez was a great promoter of the labor movement and trade unionism in Paraguay. He was strongly influenced by the life and works of Raphael Barret and Jos\u00e9 William Bertotto, influences which would later be revealed in his various journalistic and literary productions, supporting social causes via these means.\n\nJust as those fought and ensured the rights of the proletariat, Ramos Gim\u00e9nez has always been closely linked to these efforts. He founded, on December 3, 1914, along with Rufino Recalde Milesi and several others (among them probably Libre Jara), ''el Partido Obrero'' (the Workers Party), which later, in 1918, was renamed the ''Partido Socialista Revolucionario'' (the Socialist Revolutionary Party).\n\nHe was also a proponent of \"Centro Regional Workers of Paraguay\" along with Rufino Recalde Milesi, Cayetano Raimundi Soler Ignacio Nunez and many others.\n\nDue to his critical and fierce reasoning, but justified opposition, he was shot, becoming the victim of social struggle. Fortunately the attack was not fatal so he was able to slowly recover.\n\n==References==\n<references \/>\n\n{{Persondata \n| NAME              = Ramos Gimenez, Leopoldo \n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES = \n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Paraguayan journalist\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 1891 \n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = \n| DATE OF DEATH     = 1988 \n| PLACE OF DEATH    = \n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ramos Gimenez, Leopoldo}}\n[[Category:1891 births]]\n[[Category:1988 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Villarrica, Paraguay]]\n[[Category:Paraguayan writers]]\n[[Category:Paraguayan journalists]]\n[[Category:Marxists]]\n[[Category:Paraguayan anarchists]]","timestamp":"20160410103221","user-timestamp":"20150410103221"},{"title":"Talk:Cornbread, Earl and Me","content":"{{Film|American-task-force=yes|class=start}}\n{{WikiProject Basketball|class=start|importance=low}}","timestamp":"20160410103221","user-timestamp":"20150410103221"},{"title":"2010 in arthropod paleontology","content":"{{Year nav topic5|2=arthropod paleontology|3=science}}\n{{Portal|Paleontology|History of science}}\nThis '''list of [[fossil]] [[arthropod]]s described in 2010''' is a list of new [[taxa]] of [[trilobite]]s, fossil [[insect]]s, [[crustacean]]s, [[arachnid]]s and other fossil arthropods of every kind that have been [[binomial nomenclature|described]] during the year 2010.

T\u014dfuku-ji takes its name from two temples in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], [[T\u014ddai-ji]] and [[K\u014dfuku-ji]].<ref name=\"jr_tofukuji\">Japan Reference: [http:\/\/www.wa-pedia.com\/japan-guide\/tofukuji_kyoto.shtml  T\u014dfuku-ji]<\/ref> It is one of the so-called [[Five Mountain System|Kyoto ''Gozan'']] or \"five great Zen temples of Kyoto\". Its honorary ''[[Buddhist temples in Japan#sang\u014d|sang\u014d]]'' prefix is {{nihongo|'''Enichi-san'''|\u6167\u65e5\u5c71}}.\n\n==History==\nT\u014dfuku-ji was founded in 1236 by the imperial [[chancellor]] [[Kuj\u014d Michiie]].<ref>Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1956). ''Kyoto: The Old Capital of Japan, 794-1869,'' p. 152.<\/ref>  He appointed the monk [[Enni]] as founding priest, who had studied [[Rinzai school|Rinzai]] [[Zen]] Buddhism in China under the monk [[Wuzhun Shifan]]. The temple was burned but rebuilt in the 15th century according to original plans.  Tofuku-ji was one of the five temples of the [[Five Mountain System]].\n\n===Abbots===\nIn 1486 [[Ry\u014dan Keigo]] became the 171st abbot of T\u014dfuku-ji.  At the end of the 16th century [[Ankokuji Ekei]] was appointed abbot.  From 1980 to 2009 T\u014dfuku-ji has been led by head abbot [[Keido Fukushima|Keid\u014d Fukushima]].<ref>Harris, Ishwar C.

It is a [[National Treasures of Japan|National Treasure]] of Japan. It is two stories high and five bays wide. The central three bays are doors.\n\nCurrently, the T\u014dfuku-ji complex includes 24 sub-temples, though in the past the number has been as high as 53.\n\n==Artwork==\nT\u014dfuku-ji's large ''nehan-zu'' painting depicts Buddha on his death bed.  This massive image (7 x 14 meters) is the second largest in Japan.  The image at nearby [[Senny\u016b-ji]] is the largest of its kind in Japan, measuring 8 x 16 meters. Both images are rarely displayed, most recently in 2003 for three days only.<ref>[http:\/\/search.japantimes.co.jp\/cgi-bin\/nn20030309k1.html  \"Kansai: Who -- What: Giant Buddhas shown for three days only,\"] ''Japan Times Online.''

Plaques of Wuzhun's calligraphy is also kept at T\u014dfuku-ji.\n\n==Garden==\n[[File:Toufuku-ji hojyo7.JPG|thumb|right|The moss garden]]\nThere are a number of [[Japanese garden|gardens]] in the various precincts of T\u014dfuku-ji.\nThe current garden was designed by landscape architect [[Mirei Shigemori]] in the 1930s. The moss garden in particular has been emblematic of the renewal of Japanese gardening principles in the 20th Century.\n\nThe temple features a large number of [[Acer palmatum|Japanese maple]] trees, and is most crowded during the autumn season when people flock to see the autumn foliage.  It is a tradition to view the leaves from the Ts\u016bten-ky\u014d bridge.\n\n==Images==\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Toufuku-ji sanmon4.JPG|Main gate, side view\nImage:FundainZunantei.jpg|View from interior\nImage:Hiroshige People under maple trees by a stream.jpg|Scenic drawing of Ts\u016bten-ky\u014d bridge, by [[Hiroshige]]\nImage:Tsuten-kyo bridge.JPG|Tsuten-ky\u014d bridge during autumn\nImage:Tofukuji Tsutenkyo.jpg|Ts\u016bten-ky\u014d\nImage:ReiunIn GaunNoNiwa.jpg|Dry Zen garden at Reiun-in\nImage:Toufuku-ji kaizandou3.JPG|Garden at Kaizand\u014d \nImage:TofukujiRyoginanToutei.jpg|Garden at Ryoginan-t\u014dtei\nImage:Tofukuji torii.jpg|''Torii'' gates leading to steps\nImage:Tofukuji stairs.jpg|Steps\nImage:Toufuku-ji hondou2.JPG|Main hall\nImage:TofukujiKaisando.jpg|Kaizand\u014d\n\n<\/gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Zen]]\n*[[Enni]]\n*[[Wuzhun Shifan]]\n*[[List of Buddhist temples]]\n*[[List of Buddhist temples in Kyoto]]\n*[[List of National Treasures of Japan (temples)]]\n*[[List of National Treasures of Japan (paintings)]]\n*[[List of National Treasures of Japan (writings)]]\n* For an explanation of terms concerning Japanese Buddhism, Japanese Buddhist art, and Japanese Buddhist temple architecture, see the [[Glossary of Japanese Buddhism]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n* Baroni, Helen Josephine.

He went 15\u20137 with a 1.82 ERA in 24 games that year. Records indicate that he did not play in 1918; however he did play in 1919. He spent most of the year in the minors, pitching for the [[Toronto Maple Leafs (International League)|Toronto Maple Leafs]] of the [[International League]] and going 14\u201310 with a 2.79 ERA in 32 games. On April 24, he made his major league debut. He made two relief appearances with the New York Giants that year, going 0\u20130 with a 5.40 ERA.\n\nOn August 1, 1919, he was traded by the Giants with [[Red Causey]], [[Mickey O'Neil (baseball)|Mickey O'Neil]], [[Joe Oeschger]] and $55,000 to the Boston Braves for [[Art Nehf]].\n\nIn 1920, he mostly pitched for the [[Indianapolis Indians]] of the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]], going 20\u201313 with a 2.52 ERA in 40 games. He pitched three games in the big leagues, starting one of them. He went 1\u20130 with a 6.52 ERA for the Braves. He played his final big league game on May 15.\n\nHe did not pitch professionally in 1921 or 1922. He returned to professional baseball in 1923, pitching for the minor league [[Norfolk Tars]]. That year, he went 12\u201312 with a 2.94 ERA in 41 games. He spent 1924 and 1925 with the [[Richmond Colts]], going 13\u20135 with a 3.16 ERA in 1924 and 4\u20139 with a 5.42 ERA in 1925.\n\nOverall, he went 1\u20130 with a 6.06 ERA in 5 big league games (1 start).<ref>[http:\/\/www.baseball-reference.com\/players\/j\/jonesjo01.shtml Baseball Reference]<\/ref> He went 78\u201366 with a 2.91 ERA in six minor league seasons.<ref>[http:\/\/www.baseball-reference.com\/minors\/player.cgi?id=jones-015joh Baseball Reference Minors]<\/ref>\n\n==Managerial career==\n[[Baseball Reference]] Minors indicates that Jones managed the [[Meridian Metropolitans]] and [[Marshall Indians]] in 1923 and the [[Marshall Tigers]] in 1937. This may be in error though, for multiple reasons: the Meridian Metropolitans ceased to exist in 1913, and the team in Meridian in 1923 was the [[Meridian Mets]]. Furthermore, Jones was actively pitching in 1923 for neither the Metropolitans (or Mets) or Indians, so it would seem difficult for him two manage two teams and pitch a complete season with a third team all in the same year.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Jones, Johnny\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American baseball player\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = August 25, 1892\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Arcadia, Louisiana]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     = June 5, 1980\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Ruston, Louisiana]]\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jones, Johnny}}\n[[Category:1892 births]]\n[[Category:1980 deaths]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball pitchers]]\n[[Category:New York Giants (NL) players]]\n[[Category:Boston Braves players]]\n[[Category:Baseball players from Louisiana]]\n[[Category:People from Arcadia, Louisiana]]","timestamp":"20160410103242","user-timestamp":"20150410103242"},{"title":"Category talk:Films directed by Terence Davies","content":"{{Film|class=Cat}}","timestamp":"20160410103243","user-timestamp":"20150410103243"},{"title":"User talk:Tonywalton\/Archive-May-2012","content":"{{talkarchive}}\n\n== Abuse Filter on the Article Feedback Tool ==\n\nHey there :).

His family fled the [[Ukraine]] for Mexico after the [[Russian Revolution]] to escape Jewish persecution and Filcer grew up in [[Mexico City]]. His interest in painting came early but had to sell a painting before his family would accept his vocation. Strongly influenced by [[Van Gogh]]\u2019s life, he began to draw and paint the struggles of everyday people, something he has continued since. His work has been exhibited in various countries of the world and has been recognized with several medals and membership in the [[Sal\u00f3n de la Pl\u00e1stica Mexicana]].\n\n==Life==\nFilcer was born in [[Zhytomyr]], [[Ukraine]] in 1927 to a Jewish family.<ref name=ownbio>{{cite web |title=Algunos \u2018Tracos\u2019acerca de Luis Filcer |publisher=Luis Filcer |language=Spanish |url= http:\/\/www.luisfilcer.net\/BIOGRAFiA.html |accessdate=November 12, 2013 }}<\/ref><ref name=mladron>{{cite news |author= Margarita Ladr\u00f3n de Guevara\n|title= Lo que me interesa es la vida: Luis Filcer |date=January 24, 2010  |publisher= Diario de Quer\u00e9taro |language=Spanish |url= http:\/\/www.oem.com.mx\/elsoldesanluis\/notas\/n1490822.htm |accessdate=November 12, 2013 }}<\/ref> When he was only six months old, the family fled the country because of Jewish persecution after the Russian Revolution. No one in his family would talk about the horrors they experienced in the Ukraine. After arriving to Mexico City, the family settled in the La Lagunilla neighborhood. His father was able to speak only a few words in Spanish and sold clothing in the streets. He later formed a partnership with other immigrants to open a sweater factory. Since childhood, Filcer disliked school but learned to draw. He also studied accounting in order to help his father.  He stated that although working at the family business was hard, he was able to meet many people in this way, for whom he often drew pictures for fun.<ref name=vision>{{cite book  |title= Vision de M\u00e9xico y sus Artistas |volume=II |year=2001  |publisher= Qualitas  |location=Mexico City |isbn=968 5005 58 3 |language=Spanish, English |pages=241\u2013244}}<\/ref>\n\nWhen he was sixteen he entered the [[Academy of San Carlos]] to study painting, attending class in the morning and working in the afternoon. Each evening after the close of business, he painted.  He later studied at the workshop of Spanish painter Jos\u00e9 Bardasano for three years, focusing on drawing and painting.<ref name=ownbio\/><ref name=vision\/>\n\nAt age seventeen, Filcer read the biography of Van Gogh, and after observing the poverty of the market workers began to draw them. He then decided to travel to [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|Guanajuato]] to learn and draw miners and the difficult conditions under which they worked.<ref name=ownbio\/><ref name=mladron\/>\n\nAlthough his art instructors encouraged him, his father saw painting as nothing more than a hobby. Filcer had decided to make painting a career but could not convince his father to approve until he had sold his first painting at the Galer\u00eda Romano.<ref name=vision\/>\n\nAn award at the C\u00edrculo de Bellas Artes allowed Filcer to obtain a scholarship to live and study for two and a half years in Paris and Rome, beginning at the [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris.<ref name=vision\/> However, in addition to spending hours of his own time drawing models at the academy, he also drew and painted common people such as fishermen, peasants, [[stevedore]]s, factory workers and beggars.<ref name=ownbio\/><ref name=mladron\/><ref name=vision\/> He did this activity with a friend named Juvenal Sans\u00f3, which whom he went to Rome to continue his studies. However, a teacher there asked him why he did not paint more [[Bohemian]] people, which angered him. He left the Italian school after only a month. While in Europe, Filcer spent time traveling and visiting museums in London, Madrid, Amsterdam, Rome and [[Florence]], studying the paintings there.<ref name=mladron\/><ref name=vision\/> He stated that he learned more in this way, with his first views of works by [[Francisco de Goya]] changing his life. Van Gogh\u2019s work also strongly affected him.<ref name=ownbio\/><ref name=mladron\/>\n\n==Career==\nOver his career, Filcer has had over 300 exhibition around the world, especially Mexico, the Netherlands, the United States, Belgium, Japan, France, Israel, Italy and Germany.<ref name=vision\/><ref name=rogallery>{{cite news \n|title= Luis Filcer, Mexican (1927 - ) |publisher= Ro Gallery  |url= http:\/\/rogallery.com\/Filcer_Luis\/filcer-biography.html |accessdate=November 12, 2013 }}<\/ref>\n\nHe began his career in Mexico, where sold his first painting and in 1949 worked at the [[Taller de Gr\u00e1fica Popular]] .<ref name=rogallery\/> He represented Mexico in biennales in Chile, Japan and England, which led to a scholarship to study in Paris and Rome.

The Progressive Conservative Party was, in turn, a renaming of the first Conservative Party of Canada.\n\nDuring Robert Borden's coalition government of 1917-1920, the Liberal Party of Canada split into two groups: the [[Liberal\u2013Unionist]] who supported the coalition and the [[Laurier Liberals]] who opposed it.\n\nThe Communist Party of Canada changed its name multiple times in its history. It was founded as the Communist Party of Canada in 1921. From 1938 until 1943 its candidates ran under the banner Unity or United Progressive. In 1943 it adopted the name [[Labor-Progressive Party]]. It won one seat under this name in 1945. In 1959 it reverted to the name Communist Party of Canada and has kept that name to the present.\n\nThe Marxist\u2013Leninist Party of Canada unofficially uses the name \"Communist Party of Canada (Marxist\u2013Leninist)\", but Elections Canada does not allow it to be registered by that name because of potential confusion with the Communist Party of Canada.\n\nThe first Rhinoceros Party disbanded in 1993. When it was revived in 2006 it used the name \"neorhino.ca\". The party changed its name to Rhinoceros Party in 2010.\n\nThe Party for Accountability, Competency and Transparency was originally called the Online Party of Canada.\n\n== Historical parties==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\"|\n!

As Sandbrook put it, \"Thanks to the enthusiastic salesmanship of McGowan and her fellow presenters, the emerging youth culture that had once been confined to the capital [London] or to the great cities could now be seen and copied almost immediately from [[Cornwall]] to the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]]\".<ref name=Sandbrook\/> The musician and jazz critic [[George Melly]] thought ''RSG'' \"made pop music work on a truly national scale ...

But Lichfield, with his impeccable manners, refused to upset his subjects by letting them know that in advance.<ref>Mark Edmonds in ''Sunday Times Magazine'', 4 May 2008. An \"in group\", published by ''Queen'' in June 1967, included actress [[Susannah York]], actor [[Tom Courtenay]] and model [[Twiggy]]<\/ref><\/blockquote>\n\nHowever, in 1978, McGowan was the subject of a tribute \"I'm in love with Cathy McGowan\" \u2014 by the English band [[Generation X (band)|Generation X]] in the song \"Ready Steady Go\", a single that hit no. 47 on the UK charts.

These nucleotides were found to accumulate rapidly in E. coli cells starved for amino acids, and inhibit synthesis of ribosomal and transfer RNAs.<ref>Cashel M, Gentry DR, Hernandez VH, Vinella D: The stringent response. In ''Escherichia coli'' and ''Salmonella'': cellular and molecular biology, edn 2. Edited by Neidhardt FC, Curtiss III R, Ingraham JL, Lin ECC, Low KB, Magasanik B, Reznikoff WS, Riley M, Schaechter M, Umbarger HE.ASM Press; 1996. <\/ref>\n\n== Absence of (p)ppGpp ==\nA complete absence of (p)ppGpp causes multiple amino acid requirements, poor survival of aged cultures, aberrant cell division, morphology, and immotility, as well as being locked in a growth mode during entry  into starvation.\n\n== Synthesis and degradation of (p)ppGpp ==\n(p)ppGpp is created via pppGpp [[synthase]], also known as RelA, and is converted from pppGpp to [[ppGpp]] via pppGpp phosphohydrolase. RelA is associated with about every one in two hundred [[ribosome]]s and it becomes activated when an uncharged [[transfer RNA]] (tRNA) molecule enters the A site of the ribosome, due to the shortage of amino acid required by the tRNA. If a [[mutant]] bacterium is ''relA''<sup>\u2212<\/sup> it is said to be relaxed and no regulation of RNA production due to amino acid absence is seen. \n\nWhen the amino acid balance in the cell is restored, (p)ppGpp is [[hydrolysis|hydrolysed]] by [[SpoT]]. \n\n== Targets of (p)ppGpp ==\nTargets of (p)ppGpp include [[rRNA]] [[operon]]s, of which there are seven in ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (a commonly used [[bacteria]]l [[model organism]]), all of which have 2 [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]]s. When (p)ppGpp associates with the promoter it affects the [[RNA polymerase]] [[enzyme]]'s ability to bind and initiate [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. It is thought that (p)ppGpp may affect the stability of the open complex formed by RNA polymerase on DNA and therefore affect promoter clearance. Its presence also leads to an increase in pausing during transcription [[Transcription_(genetics)#Elongation|elongation]] and it competes with [[nucleoside triphosphate]] [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]]s.\n\nThere is now a consensus that (p)ppGpp is a determinant of growth rate control rather than nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) substrate concentrations.\n\n== Impact of (p)ppGpp on bacterial physiology ==\n===Inhibition of growth by inhibition of protein synthesis===\nppGpp inhibits IF2-mediated fMet-Phe initiation dipeptide formation, probably by interfering with 30S and 50S subunit interactions. E. coli accumulates more ppGpp than pppGpp during amino acid starvation, and ppGpp has about 8-fold greater efficiency than that of pppGpp. While B. subtilis accumulates more pppGpp than ppGpp. \n\n<!-- No text to explain this\n===Regulation of ribosome number===\n-->\n===Inhibition of DNA replication===\nIn E. coli amino acid starvation inhibited DNA replication at the initiation stage at oriC, most probably owing to the lack of the DnaA replication initiation protein. In B. subtilis, the replication arrest due to (p)ppGpp accumulation is caused by the binding of an [[Rtp protein]] to specific sites about 100-200kb away from oriC in both directions. DNA primase (DnaG) was directly inhibited by (p)ppGpp. Unlike E. coli, B. subtilis accumulates more pppGpp than ppGpp; the more abundant nucleotide is a more-potent DnaG inhibitor. ppGpp can bind with Obg protein which belongs to the conserved, small GTPase protein family. Obg protein interacts with several regulators (RsbT, RsbW, RsbX) necessary for the stress activation of sigma B.\n\n===Impact on phage replication and development===\nThe (p)ppGpp levels of the host seem to act as a sensor for phage lambda development, primarily affecting transcription. Modest ppGpp levels inhibit pR and active pE, pI, and paQ promoters in vivo and have effects in vitro that seem to favor lysogeny. In contrast, absent or high concentrations of (p)ppGpp favor lysis. Modest ppGpp levels favor lysogeny by leading to low HflB (FtsH). When ppGpp is either absent or high, HflB protease levels are high; this leads to lower [[CII]] (a lysogeny-promoting phage protein)\nand favors lysis.\n\n===Impact on transcription===\n\n====Characteristics of affected promoters====\nOne of the key elements of promoters inhibited by (p)ppGpp is the presence of a GC-rich discriminator, defined as a region between TATA-box (-10 box) and +1 nt (where +1 is the transcription start sit). Promoters negatively regulated by ppGpp have a 16-bp linker, in contrast with the 17-bp consensus. Promoters activated by ppGpp seem to have a AT-rich discriminator and linger linkers (for example, the his promoter linker is 18 bp).\n\n====RNAP is the target====\nGenetic evidence suggesting that RNAP was the target of ppGpp came from the discovery that M+ mutants (also called stringent RNAP mutants) display in vitro and in vivo mimicry of physiology and transcription regulation conferred by (p)ppGpp, even in its absence. Cross-linking ppGpp to RNAP reinforced this notion. Structural details of an association between ppGpp and RNAP came from the analysis of cocrystals that positioned ppGpp in the secondary channel of RNAP near the catalytic center.\n\n====DksA augments regulation====\nDksA is a 17-kDa protein, its structure is similar to GreA and GreB, which are well-characterized transcriptional elongation factors. GreA and GreB bind directly to RNAP rather than DNA and act by inserting their N-terminal coiled-coil finger domain through the RNAP secondary channel. Two conserved acidic residues at the tip of the finger domain are necessary to induce RNAP's intrinsic ability to cleave backtracked RNA. DksA also possesses two acidic residues at its finger tip, but it does not induce nucleolytic cleavage activity. Instead, these residues are proposed to stabilize ppGpp binding to RNAP by mutual coordination of an Mg2+ ion that is crucial for polymerization.\n\n===Transcription inhibition and activation===\n\nppGpp directly inhibits transcription from ribosomal promoters.  One model is ppGpp and DksA together and independently decrease the stability of the open complexes formed on DNA by RNAP.  Another model is the trapping mechanism. In this model, RNAP is trapped by ppGpp in closed complexes and is unable to initiate transcription. Thus, ppGpp seems to act at many levels, and the mechanism of its action is a complex outcome of several factors, intrinsic promoter properties not being the least of them. The transcription activation by ppGpp can be direct or indirect. Direct activation occurs when RNAP interacts with effectors, such as ppGpp, DksA or both, to increase transcription from a given promoter. Indirect activation by these effectors of one promoter relies on inhibition of other (strong) promoters, leading to increased availability of RNAP that indirectly activates transcription initiation. The promoters that activated directly by ppGpp include P''argI'', P''thrABC'', P''livJ'', and P''hisG''. The indirectly activation promoters include these dependent on sigma factors: S, H, N, E. When strong promoters, such as ''rrn'', are inhibited, there more RNAP are available for these alternative sigma factors.\n\n===Pathogenesis and (p)ppGpp===\n\nWhen (p)ppGpp is absent, pathogenicity is compromised for reasons that vary with the organism studied. Deleting ''rel''A and ''spo''T genes, but not ''rel''A alone, gave a (p)ppGpp<sup>0<\/sup> state that resulted in strong attenuation in mice and noninvasiveness in vitro. Vaccine tests reveal that 30 days after single immunization with the (p)ppGpp<sup>0<\/sup> strain, mice were protected from challenge with wild-type Salmonella at a dose 10<sup>6<\/sup>-fold above the established LD<sub>50<\/sub>.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading==\n*{{Cite journal|year=1995|journal= Microbiol Rev |volume=59|pages= 623\u201345|pmid=8531889|last1=Condon|first1=C|last2=Squires|first2=C|last3=Squires|first3=CL|title=Control of rRNA transcription in Escherichia coli|issue=4|pmc=239391}}\n*{{Cite journal|year=2004|journal= Cell  |volume=117|pages= 299\u2013310|doi=10.1016\/S0092-8674(04)00401-5|pmid=15109491|last1=Artsimovitch|first1=I|last2=Patlan|first2=V|last3=Sekine|first3=S|last4=Vassylyeva|first4=MN|last5=Hosaka|first5=T|last6=Ochi|first6=K|last7=Yokoyama|first7=S|last8=Vassylyev|first8=DG|title=Structural basis for transcription regulation by alarmone ppGpp|issue=3}}\n*{{Cite journal|year=2005|journal= Trends in Microbiology  |volume=13|pages= 236\u201342|doi=10.1016\/j.tim.2005.03.008|pmid=15866041|last1=Magnusson|first1=LU|last2=Farewell|first2=A|last3=Nystr\u00f6m|first3=T|title=PpGpp: A global regulator in Escherichia coli|issue=5}}\n*{{Cite journal|year=2008|journal= Annu.

Basically, people who favor BCE\/CE either claim that this is an emerging scholarly norm or that these terms are more neutral than AD\/BC which they see as necessarily reflecting a Christian POV.  People who favor AD\/BC either are Christian and think that since this article is about Jesus the terms are appropriate, or believe that these terms no longer carry a Christian connotation and in fact represent an established convention that should be followed in all articles and that there is no POV problem.

[[User:Homestarmy|Homestarmy]] 18:42, 1 December 2006 (UTC)\n:::Jews have their own calendar.  I believe it is the year 5767 atm.  If we want to be fair to Jews, and acknowledge their culture, we should use their calendar.  That would mean that we say AD 2006 \/ Kislev 5767 in respective settings.  CE is not an attempt to be respectful of Jewish culture.  It is an attempt to secularize Christian culture, and its contributions to the world.  In other words, it is a product of a secular attitude that religious contributions to mankind are only beneficial once stripped of their religious nature.  That attitude is as much a threat to Judaism as to Christianity.  The attempt to say that CE is \"tolerant\" of Judaism is simply the secular myth that de-sacralizing public matters is a step toward tolerance, i.e. that secularism is the utopian solution to strife rather than God (and religion).  In this sense secularism is neither tolerant of Christianity nor Judaism, and I think you can well observe that secular movements within the West have hurt Jewish culture as much as Christian. And, SL, to just speak of the West, Judaism did contribute much to western culture, but it did not contribute a calendar - that's the only reason my comments above were framed as such.  [[User:Lostcaesar|Lostcaesar]] 23:38, 1 December 2006 (UTC)\n\n::::This is nonsense. BCE\/CE emerged because the Western numbering system is now used throughout the world, most of which is non-Christian. Yes, others still persist locally, but it is the standard in business and scholarship. Remember the ''internatonal'' celebrations of the year 2000? Chrstianity did ''not'' contribute a calendar, just a start date - not much of an \"achevement\". In English, the names of months derive from Roman deities and of days from Germanic pagan ones. We still persist with these names even though the beliefs are long long gone. The CE notation is not about \"tolerance\" of Judaism, but about recognising non-Christian ''sensitivities''. [[User:Paul Barlow|Paul B]] 00:12, 2 December 2006 (UTC)\n:::::Asia and the Middle East have their own calendars.  Christianity contriubted the notion that history should be counted from the Incarnation, i.e. that time itself changed with the birth of Christ.  In (previously) Christian cultures some wish to employ BCE\/CE because they don't want Christianity (or any religion) to be ''publically'' expressed.  In this way they deny, and insult, what Christianity is about: that Christ is the source of unity of mankind.  Respect for other cultures would be employing their calendars in relevant situations, not asking them to take up a dating system that counts form the Incarnation of the Lord and acting like, if we don't say \"lord\", it will be respectful of who they are and what they believe.  Its like celebrating that certain holiday on December 25 without so much as whispering just what that day is - there is no culture here, just a ghost of a culture.  There is a difference between respecting cultures and destroying cultures. [[User:Lostcaesar|Lostcaesar]] 09:40, 2 December 2006 (UTC)\n\n:I'm sure we all have passionate reasons why BCE is the devil (or the best new thing). But maybe we should keep that to ourselves.

He believed that Jesus, along with [[Buddha]], were essentially good men.\n\n:I disagree; I think a cursory reading of the genealogy of morals would make it clear that Nietzsche wrote Jesus's message off as inherently life-negating, and a cursory reading of the Bible would have made it clear that he was right - e.g. anyone who tries to save his life will lose it.

Now, should there be a discussion of His ethnicity on this page?  That's something to discuss.  But civilly.  I'd suggest that the reason your IP address is banned continually when you fix errors is because the edits you're making are going against discussions being made on the talk page about the same thing.

However, I feel the following is a good discussion on why WaiteDavid137's edit is inappropriate.\n\nThe opening line of the article has been edited to say that the article \"alleges\" that Jesus is a \"hystorical\" figure and then references the article entitled, \"Jesus as a Myth\". There are some problems here. \n\nFirst, the author of line has misspelled the word historical. This doesn't meet wikipedia's standards of quality. It needs to be corrected.\n\nSecondly, the location of the edit is poorly placed and grammatically incorrect. The article should not start with a sentence fragment, particularly one dealing with \"other views\" of the person of Jesus.\nThat is better placed in one of the subsections of the article, not as the article's opening line.\n\nThird, the editor states that the article indicates that Jesus was an actual historical figure, making it \"biased\". However, this is the opinion of the majority of historians and researchers about the character of Jesus Christ. By the editor's standard, an article about the earth could be considered biased because it indicates that the earth is roughly spherical and not flat. Or, an article on Elvis Presley is biased because it indicates that he is deceased due to suicide, rather than hiding out in New Mexico. These views can be expressed in the article, but would not be considered generally appropriate for the opening of the article. <small>\u2014The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[Special:Contributions\/216.53.128.158|216.53.128.158]] ([[User talk:216.53.128.158|talk]]) 20:46, 6 December 2006 (UTC).<\/small><!-- HagermanBot Auto-Unsigned -->\n\n:: you've conflated two seperate things ''Third, the editor states that the article indicates that Jesus was an actual historical figure, making it \"biased\".

[[Pontius Pilate]] was a known historical figure, as were [[Caiaphas]] and many other people mentioned in the Gospels. To single out Jesus as a mythical figure is simply [[selection bias]]. There were many rebellions and attempted rebellions by Jews against the Roman occupation. Many Jews of the time looked to the coming of the Messiah to overthow the Romans and restablish the Davidic dynasty. It's only logical that if someone achieved enough of a following as a Messiah figure, he would run afoul of the Romans. \n::Consider the [[criterion of embarrassment]].

I mean, he did argue with people, and he got arrested, but according to documentation, those were 1) about theology, and 2) a setup.\n\n== Jesus and Islam ==\n\nThe article recognises, eventually, that Jesus is a major prophet of Islam. However, I think it would be pertinent to make a reference to his importance to Islam in the introduction. I thus propose one of the following:\n1) The first sentence be changed to say something like, \"Jesus (8\u20132 BC\/BCE to 29\u201336 AD\/CE),[1] also known as Jesus of Nazareth, is the central figure of Christianity and a major prophet of Islam.\"\n2) A sentence be added to the introduction, saying something along the lines of \"Jesus is also a major prophet of Islam, in which he holds a non-divine status.\" (not very well worded, but you get the idea)\n3) Or the article stays as it is. I don't think this is satisfactory as we get no mention of Jesus' position in Islam, which is significant both for that religion and for comparisons between religions, until waaay down the page.\n\nWhat do people think? [[User:Polocrunch|Polocrunch]] 14:27, 13 December 2006 (UTC)\n\n:What you're really saying is that the section on Views of Jesus, which is down at the end of the articler, be reflected in the introduction. I have no problem with that, but since Jesus is far more important to Christianity than to any other religion, I'd put it last. Possibly a separate paragraph, saying that Jews believe the Christians are mistaken about identifying Jesus as the Christ, and that Muslims accept him as a major prophet but reject the idea that he was the son of God? [[User:PiCo|PiCo]] 02:03, 14 December 2006 (UTC)\n\n::If you look through the history, you'll find that there was a fourth paragraph in the introduction for the Islamic view, but it was removed per concerns about prominence, typified by [[WP:NPOV#Undue_weight]]. The introduction is meant to summarize the major points of the article. The two largest sections are the Gospel\/Christian view and the historical view. Less 'prominent' views of Jesus are confined to the 'other views' section and thus are not necessary required to be summarized in the introduction. However, I personally am indifferent to the inclusion of such a paragraph in the introduction. \u2014[[User:Aiden|<font color=\"077cd0\">'''Aiden'''<\/font>]] 04:23, 14 December 2006 (UTC)\n:::When I read the original post, I was confused because I was thinking about that fourth paragraph.

Although you and I, may have heard the solution a hundred times from the pulpit, our own personal experience is not a subsitute for a source-citation. Omiting the phrase \"legal father\" does not make Joseph unimportant. He was Jesus' guardian, and Mary's husband, that's why he's important. Not because it was legal, illegal, extralegal, or nonlegal. Undue weight must always be taken seriously because in this case, it's pushing a solution that \"half of mankind\" doesn't accept. Only a few scholars and theologians think it *might* be this way, but the best of them are unsure of whether it actually *is* this way. That's why it's POV to simply state it here, unsourced.

In any event, the question here is not what was Joseph's status, but what are the major views from relevant, reliable, verifiable sources, concerning Joseph's status.  Do the Gospel's say \"legal father\" or \"guardian?\"  Do any major historians, Catholic (Meier or Crossan) or non-religious (Sanders, Vermes, Fredricksen) say \"legal father\" or \"guardian?\"  Let's not violate NOR.

[[User:Slrubenstein|Slrubenstein]]   |  [[User talk:Slrubenstein|Talk]] 14:49, 15 December 2006 (UTC)\n\n:Slrubenstein, thanks for your thoughtgul comment. Let me address your points:\n:*Roman law has nothing to say on Jesus' paternity, since Jesus, nor Joseph nor Mary were not Roman citizens but Jews (Roman law only really cared about the connubium, i.e. the right of a Roman citizen and his spouse to be married under Roman law which would result in their children being Roman citizens as well. Marriages and children outside of this were unregulated and could not produce Roman citizens. \n:*Jewish law, I think (though I am no expert), rules that the husband of the mother is the father unless someone contests it. When reading the Gospel of Matthew, we see that Joseph first though there was another man but decided not to put his fiance to shame and to silently accept the child. His protest would have resulted in Mary being stoned as an adulteress.\n:*As for Joseph in the Gospels, he is nowhere called Jesus' guardian. He is called the father in Luke 2,48 (explicitely), Luke 3,23 (Jesus thought to be the son of Joseph) and Matthew 13,55 (Jesus referrred to as the son of the carpenter). That these verses can only intend to refer to a legal fatherhood is clear from the fact that Matthew and Luke clearly state the virgin birth. And of course, the genealogies imply this legal fatherhood. [[User:Str1977|Str1977]] [[User talk:Str1977|<sup>(smile back)<\/sup>]] 15:57, 15 December 2006 (UTC)\nStr1977, to repeat a point I made above, what jewish law was at that time is not at all clear.  If the sources available say \"father\" then I have no objection to this article saying \"father.\"  However, the phrase \"can only intend to refer to\" strikes me as original research.  It is not for us to add the adjective \"legal\" unless we can say that scholar x has made a certain claim about the legality of Joseph's paternity.  Unless a verifiable source discusses the specifically ''leagal'' status of the paternity, it seems to me that we cannot use the word \"legal\" without violating NOR. [[User:Slrubenstein|Slrubenstein]]   |  [[User talk:Slrubenstein|Talk]] 16:04, 15 December 2006 (UTC)\n:Slr, to repeat my point note that I toned down my statements. The sources say \"father\" but they also refer to God as father and sometimes avoid calling Joseph father (as in Marks \"son of Mary\"). My \"can only intend\" is not OR, as it is not research at all, but merely putting two and two together. Matthew and Luke clearly state that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit and not by Joseph. Hence his being called father can only relate to the legal relationship not to a biological one that (at least in the context of these two texts) doesn't exist. So I ahve to say that your statement about what we cannot add is pure and utter nonsense. Sorry about the harsh words but I only tell it like it is. NOR was never intended in such a way, IMHO. And any addition of merely father would be POV pushing.

I am not convinced that this is so (indeed, since Matthew and Luke do not say that Joseph was Jesus's \"legal father\" it seems reasonable for us to infer either that (1) they did not consider him Jesus' father at all or (2) they did not think it was necessary to distinguish between God and Joseph in terms of two distinct ''kinds'' of fathers).  Other society exists that classify fathers differently, or where there are more than three kinds of father.  So this does not go without saying.  In order not to violate NOR, we need a historian who argues that they distinguished between two types of fathers and that Joseph was the \"legal\" type. [[User:Slrubenstein|Slrubenstein]]   |  [[User talk:Slrubenstein|Talk]] 17:48, 15 December 2006 (UTC)\n:::I am assuming only what is clearly visible: you will not dispute that 1st century Jews knew where children came from and hence they knew about biological fatherhood, right? You will also not dispute that they distinguished one another by names and patronyms, so they also had a concept of legal (or whatever you want to call it) fatherhood, right? Of couse, normally they are one and the same. However, there were adoptions, and as the Gospels show, at least some Jews considered Jesus to not having been the biological son of his legal father.

To do so would be to violate NPOV and NOR.  Historians and anthropologists have proven that people with different cultures - non-Western people living today, and people (including people in Europe and the Near East) had different beliefs about the body and the family and, accordingly, about paternity - so it is simply unreasonble to assume that people from aother time and place necessarily share my beliefs about the body and the family.  Perhaps Mary nd Joseph and their neighbors ''did'' share my beliefs about the body and the family.  But that is for historians to demontrate, not for you to guess.

The more traditional way of making this distinction is by calling Joseph Jesus' earthly father, and God His heavenly father. This would be what I'd like to se in this article.

[[User:Lostcaesar|Lostcaesar]] 15:03, 23 December 2006 (UTC)\n:::Lostceaser, whatever the supplement is, it should not violate NOR.  And I donot see why NPOV cannot guide us here.  The issue is ''not'' whether the article claims that Jesus was or was not the biological son of Jesus because articles should never claim ''anything'' on these kinds of matters - our standard is verifiability, not truth.  If there are verifiable sources that have the POV that Jesus was not conceived by the Holy Spirit and was instead the biological son of Joseph, we ''must'' include that POV but we make it clear that it is one POV, identify the POV, and provide the source.  If there are verifiable sources that have the POV that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit and thus not the biological son of Joseph, the same rule applies - we ''must'' include that POV but we make it clear that it is a POV and provide the source.  There is nothing wrong with providing multiple POVs, indeed, we ought to do so.  Now, to specifics: if a Gospel identifies Joseph as the father and says nothing about conception by the Holy Spirit, we need to report that.  If another Gospel says Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit and never identifies Joseph as the father, we need to report that too.  And if another Gospel says Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit ''and'' that Joseph was Jesus' father, we have to report that too.  Remember, we are talking about a section of the article on Gospel accounts of Jesus - if the Gospels differ, we should report that.  Now, I understand that there is a long tradition of Christian clerics and theologians interpreting the Gospels.  This article is not the appropriate place to go into those interpretations (or interpretation, if all Christians agree).  This article is already too long.  We have links to other articles that focus on different themes (e.g. we have a link to an article on the historical Jesus) - we have a link to the article on [[Christology]] and it seems to me that that is the appropriate place to go into detail on differeing interpretations or debates among theologicans, although you may already know of a more appropriate article.

Miller, editor, translation note on Mark 12:35-37: \"With the crowds now properly impressed, Jesus poses his own riddle. He quotes the opening lines of Psalm 110, used in the coronation rituals of ancient Israelite and Judean kings. The (anointed) king referred to is taken by Jesus to mean the Messiah (the Hebrew word meaning \"anointed\"). This little story suggests that Mark does not agree with the tradition that Jesus was a ''son of David'' (a descendant of David's line), since otherwise Jesus' words mean that he is denying his own legitimacy to be considered God's Anointed.\"\n\n[http:\/\/jewishencyclopedia.com\/view.jsp?artid=254&letter=J&search=Jesus#1009 Jewish Encyclopedia: Jesus: Legends Concerning His Birth]: \"Some legends, however, are artificial rather than the natural product of popular fancy. To this category belong those concerning Jesus' birthplace. The fact that Nazareth was his native town\u2014where as the oldest son he followed his father's trade of carpenter (Mark i. 9, vi. 3; comp. Matt. xiii. 55; John vii. 41)\u2014seemed to be in conflict with the claim to the Messiahship, which, according to Micah v. 1 (A. V. 2) (comp. John vii. 42; Yer. Ber. ii. 5a; Lam. R. i. 15), called for Beth-lehem of Judah as the place of his origin; hence, the two different legends, one in Luke i. 26, ii. 4, and the other in Matt. ii. 1-22, where the parallel to Moses (comp. Ex. iv. 19) is characteristic. In support of the Messianic claim, also, the two different genealogies were compiled: the one, in Matt. i. 1-16, tracing Joseph's pedigree through forty-two generations back to Abraham, with a singular emphasis upon sinners and heathen ancestresses of the house of David (comp. Gen. R. xxiii., li., lxxxv.; Ruth R. iv. 7; Naz. 23b; Hor. 10b; Meg. 14b); the other, in Luke iii. 23-38, tracing it back to Adam as \"the son of God\" in order to include also the non-Abrahamic world. Incompatible with these genealogies, and of pagan origin (see Boeklen, \"Die Verwandtschaft der J\u00fcdisch-Christlichen mit der Parsichen Eschatologie,\" 1902, pp. 91-94; Holtzmann, \"Hand-Commentar zum Neuen Testament,\" 1889, p. 32; Soltau, in \"Vierteljahrschrift f\u00fcr Bibelkunde,\" 1903, pp. 36-40), is the story representing Jesus as the son of the Virgin Mary and of the Holy Ghost (taken as masculine, Matt. i. 20-23; Luke i. 27-35). So also the story of the angels and shepherds hailing the babe in the manger (Luke ii. 8-20) betrays the influence of the Mithra legend (Cumont, \"Die Mysterien des Mithra,\" 1903, pp. 97, 147; \"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr die Neutestamentliche Wissenschaft,\" 1902, p. 190), whereas the legend concerning the prophecy of the two Essene saints, Simeon and Anna, and the bar mi\u1e93wah story (Luke ii. 22-39, 40-50) have a decidedly Jewish character.\"\n\n== Christian views of Jesus ==\n\nThe Christian views of Jesus just had a major addition\/overhaul, thanks to LostCaesar.

[[User:Lostcaesar|Lostcaesar]] 00:53, 16 December 2006 (UTC)\nCan I suggest taking a chronologically-based approach to the structure of this section - begin with the views of the very earliest followers, those who actually knew Christ, so far as these views can be known (and they can, from the Gospels and other NT texts), then the views of the early Fathers up to the establishment of the Church under Constantine, then the battles between orthodox and heretical views up to the time of the split between the Orthodox and Latin churches (and my first use of the word orthodox has a small letter, please note), and then the emergence of the Protestant movement, right up to the present day. (Incidentally, I don't think LC's text  needs this sentence: ''In defense of Jesus' divinity, some apologists argue that there is a trilemma, or three possibilities, resulting from Jesus' reported claims that he is the one God of Israel: either he is truly God, a liar, or a lunatic \u2014 the latter two dismissed on the basis of Jesus's coherence.'' I think we can take it as granted that anyone who doesn't believe in the Divinity of Christ (Jesus) simply isn't a Christian, and therefore doesn't hold a Christian view.)\n\n== 2 additions ==\nI know this article is already long, but I made two little additions to the plot summary of the Gospels section that I thought needed to be mentioned because of their significance.

[[User:Lostcaesar|Lostcaesar]] 00:44, 17 December 2006 (UTC)\n\n== the Magi ==\n\nOne of the most common errors made in the birth of Jesus is the inclusion of the Magi (Wise Men) at the actual Nativity, or birth, scene.  This is a HUGE error and one which is quite needless and is proved to be wrong by a very simple reading of some basic text and a little logic.  The Magi are mentioned in Matthew 2:1-12.  When they arrive at the house that the family is at, Matthew 2:14 specifically states, \u201c\u2026they saw the child with his mother\u2026\u201d.  The word for child here is just that, a child, not an infant.  Also, when Herod orders the Massacre of the Innocents, he orders the execution of all male children up to 2 years old.  This is quite unnecessary if Jesus was still an infant.  Logic and Scripture both attest that Jesus was approximately 2 years old at the time of the arrival of the Magi.  [[User:Bkholm2|Bkholm2]] 03:41, 17 December 2006 (UTC)\n\n:Your logic hinges on a few things which you have not made apparent.  The Gospel of Matthew was writen in Greek, not English.  Are you quite sure the underlying Greek word meant \"child\" and that there was *another* Greek word, then used, which meant \"infant\"?  Secondly, are you quite sure that the Massacre followed immediately upon the Magi leaving, and not some unspecified time later? [[User:Wjhonson|Wjhonson]] 03:51, 17 December 2006 (UTC)\n\n::Well first of all, I think calling it a HUGE (and capitalized) error is a big overstatement. Also keep in mind that artistic depictions do fuse events happening over time (e.g. think of depictions of a Saint which cover the Saint's entire life side by side).\n::Secondly, Bkholm's argument is indeed partly reasonable. The \"child\" vs. \"infant\" is nonsense, as even if the difference exists in Greek (I have no clue), it assumes that an infant is not a child, which is wrong. All infants are children but not all children are infants. However, his point about the age of two years is reasonable, has been made before. Also, that the massacre was close upon the Magis' heels is quite obvious, of course reckoning some for Herod realising that he has been duped. But that doesn't allow for two years.\n::Thirdly and most importantly, how to include this? [[User:Str1977|Str1977]] [[User talk:Str1977|<sup>(smile back)<\/sup>]] 15:31, 18 December 2006 (UTC)\n:::Better not to include it at all - not here on the main article. Maybe in the [[Nativity]] article. [[User:PiCo|PiCo]] 04:04, 19 December 2006 (UTC)\n\nIf I can say this without taking sides, I think the \"HUGE\" mistake referred to is huge not due to some sort of importance scale, but rather due to the widely used picture of the nativity scene which includes the magi. If you think that the magi were present about 2 years after Christ's birth, then the fact that most nativity scenes have the magi present would seem like an incorrectable error (or a \"HUGE\" error).\n\n:I would repeat Editor STR, what to do about?  PiCo has suggested including the detail in the Nativity article and I concur.  In the scheme of things this is insignificant having more to do with culture than anything else.  These types of things are relatively common within Christianity.  For example, the names of the Magi were not known until the 9th century.  Could they be the correct names or are they simply the result of the imagination of a creative, well-meaning Christian?  I don't think it really matters.

Things are just not that simple. We have to take all evidence into account and not jump on a simple note.\n:::As for Dioynsius, he placed Christ's birth in the year Herod died, which he know from a source (I think Josephus) was in the 27th year of the reign of Augustus. He calculated from the year in which Octavius adopted the name Augustus and arrived at what we call now the border between 1 BC and 1 AD. However, what Dionysius forgot was that Josephus counted Augustus' reign not from 27 BC but from 31 BC, when Octavius had defeated his rival Marcus Antonius and gained control of the entire Empire.

I have sent you a polite message which you have ignored. '''Jesus is not Chritianity''' that is the point, this is not A Christian article or site, it is a enyclopedia on JESUS, and he is central to two faiths. Your opinion of hatred is a POV, please respect the is an encyclopedia and cool off and think about it. No one opinion without proof carries any weight here!

Furthermore, my suspicion is that you may well come from a non-western culture where these kinds of tones are more normal or acceptable. Obviously, Wikipedia is not supposed to be as western-centric as it is, but it is nonetheless worth bearing in mind that this kind of tone is unlikely to help other people, especially if your \"warning\" was intended to suggest that you may soon contact the moderators.  \t \n\nHowever, regardless of whether that is true or not, it is worth noting that the best thing to do on wikipedia if someone reverts your work is simply to calmly and unemotionally explain your reasoning on the talk page. Doing things like SHOUTING or criticisng your fellow editors is unlikely to make them listen to you. Wikipedia is based upon consensus so you should try to convince your fellow editors gently at first. I have had to leave what I perceieve as being POV edits in wikipedia because of this policy, but it is right that wikipedia has it nonetheless. \t \n\nStr1977 was clearly correct that Islam is a non-Christian religion. Therefore, regardless of whether the article was structured correctly, given that structuring of the article, it is not appropriate for Islam to be outside of non-Christian views. I note that you have changed the name of \"non-Christian\" religions, which makes it make more sense (although I'm not sure the adjective \"worldwide\" is correct, when both Islam and Christianity are worldwide religions.) \t \n\nI do want to throw in one comment, that I don't think makes me want to change the article as it stands. Regardless of the centrality or not of Jesus for Islam, I'm sure you'll agree that Jesus is more central to Christianity than it is to Islam? As in, none of the Christian faith makes any sense at all if one does not hold certain truths about Jesus to be true. This may, in your view, serve only to show the flaws within Christianity, but it is nonetheless true. On the other hand, I have studied Islam at university level, and I am not aware of a single Islamic doctrine that would be affected were the ayas about Jesus removed from the Qur'an (other than the status of Jesus and perhaps Islam's relationship with Christianity). \t \n\nFurthermore, Christianity contains more information about Jesus (with an entire new testament written about Him), and is slightly larger and therefore more notable by Wikipedian policies anyway.[[User:TheologyJohn|TheologyJohn]] 01:33, 27 December 2006 (UTC)\n\nI am not saying Christianity shouldnt be a lead but it is a POV to say he is more Christian property than Islamic.

Wikipedian policies reflect the fact that objectivity is impossible and thus unenforcable, and thus aim at a form of objectivity in reporting other peoples opinions, which is easier to enforce and agree upon.\n\nJesus is in maybe a hundred odd aya's of the Qur'an - that's a sizeable amount, but not as much, and it wouldn't affect Islamic doctrine.  I don't deny that Muslims have strong feelings about their version of jesus.\n\nWhile Paul wrote a lot of the New Testament (though his wordcount is less than that of the gospels), most of the content of his letters is things about Jesus.

As TJohn points out, we all have biases, opinions, and personal POV; however, admitting it does not mean that we can completely strip their impact on articles.  BUT we should attempt to do.  We are generally sufficently self-aware to know some of our shortcomings, but there are areas when we do not see our own shortcomings and the effects of our POV.  This may be one of the for some Christians.  We Christians like to claim Jesus for our own because He is central to our faith.

God had instituted the religion practiced by the Jews, and Jesus was the Messiah who brought this religion to its fulfillment: Christianity.  Jesus was not in conflict with Judaism, only with those who wished to prevent God from finishing the work that he had started.  Thus Christianity is, in a sense, true Judaism.\n:The very first Christians understood this. They continued to go to synagogue. While there, they preached that Jesus was God. On Sunday, the day of the resurrection, they said mass (in a primitive liturgical form, granted, but still a eucharistic feast). It was the Jewish authorities who rejected Christ and then expelled the Christians from the synagogues.\n:The rejection of the Messiah, the destruction of the temple (AD 70), and subsequent expulsion of Jews from Jerusalem (AD 120) were all formative in constructing what we call \"Judaism\". Jesus did not belong to this group of Messiah-rejecting, post-temple destruction Jews. Thus it is perfectly fitting to talk of Jesus as Jewish in the sense that he followed and upheld the religion founded by God, worked through the patriarchs and prophets. But this does not mean he was Jewish (religion) in the modern sense.\n:All of that, of course, is a point of view (well two, since Muslims say something similar).

Jesus cannot be for or against something after he is gone, The works of many people come into light post humous, and people long gone become heroes, do you think Malcolm X could see his face on a US stamp? Or Che see his face on a tshirt? Jesus came did his thing and left, he was made into a god after the fact, he was trinitized 300 years after his death, these are the historical facts. Yes Paul was a Jewish convert who converted to his own religion--Christianity. hence paul followed paul's opinion of Christ, dont follow the laws of old, all Paul's belief.Ask yourself would Jesus look at the Catholic church and recognize it as derived from his ministry? I really dont think so @ all!--[[User:Halaqah|HalaTruth(\u1200\u120b\u12ab\u1215)]] 13:03, 28 December 2006 (UTC)\n:No, these are not the historical facts but simply your POV.\n:As for your question: yes, he would.\n:[[User:Str1977|Str1977]] [[User talk:Str1977|<sup>(smile back)<\/sup>]] 17:01, 28 December 2006 (UTC)\n\n== Jewish view section ==\n\nThe section ends with \"Even if Jesus had produced such a sign, Judaism states that no prophet or dreamer can contradict the laws already stated in the Torah.\" First, I have a question: What laws did Jesus contradict? As far as I know, the [[Expounding of the Law]] was more guidelines for how to ''keep'' the law, both letter and spirit, than a contradiction (\"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.\"). Secondly, I'm not sure about the wording here, because it implies that Jesus did in fact contradict the Torah, something Christians would vehemently disagree with. Perhaps more neutral wording would be to indicate that Jews do believe Jesus contradicted the Torah without stating it as fact? \u2014[[User:Aiden|<font color=\"077cd0\">'''Aiden'''<\/font>]] 17:53, 28 December 2006 (UTC)\n\n:A VERY sensitive area of discussion.\n\n:Well, Rabbi Yeshua never made it into the Talmud, so it's hard to say. ;) What do you mean by Torah? Written or oral? My own opinion is that Jesus kept the written Torah but had a slightly different interpretation of the oral Torah than his contemporaries, or the version that appears in the Talmuds. Even this isn't 100% true: it's been pointed out before thst there are points of both agreement and disagreement between Jesus' teachings and the House of Hillel, for example. IMHO, the Expounding of the Law is simply Jesus' version of the oral torah. OTHOH, Jesus' interpretation of the Sabbath laws seems to have been significantly different than many of his contemporaries.\n\n:I know that Rabbinic Judaism holds that the Oral Torah was handed down from God to Moses alongside the written Torah. As a Christian, I would have to disagree; for that matter, so would Karaite Jews. My own opinion is the Oral Torah was largely a creation of the Pharisees (and was still in flux in the first Century AD\/CE). However, I know that this is OR, and cannot be used in the article; but it might facilitate discussion. I wonder, though, what the Karaite Jewish view of Jesus would be.\n\n:I hope I have not offended anybody here. I have tried to respect other people's beliefs even when I don't agree with them. I'm simply stating my own opinion. I pray that we can keep this civil....\n\n[[User:Archola|Arch O.

It was transmitted from master to student in such a manner that if the student had any question, he would be able to ask, and thus avoid ambiguity. A written text, on the other hand, no matter how perfect, is always subject to misinterpretation.\n\n:::Furthermore, the Oral Torah was meant to cover the infinitude of cases which would arise in the course of time. It could never have been written in its entirety. It is thus written (Ecclesiastes 12:12), \"Of making many books there is no end.\" God therefore gave Moses a set of rules through which the Torah could be applied to every possible case.\n\n:::If the entire Torah would have been given in writing, everyone would be able to interpret it as he desired. This would lead to division and discord among people who followed the Torah in different ways. The Oral Torah, on the other hand, would require a central authority to preserve it, thus assuring the unity of Israel...\n\n::the Written Torah is necessary to provide the basics. If everything was by heart, then you'd have no reference point at all. There has to be a shell from which to extract the vast Torah teachings.\n\n::just a clarification of the purpose of the two torot.

(2011) ''After Capitalism''<\/ref>\n\n== Co-operative federalism versus co-operative individualism ==\nA major historical debate in co-operative economics has been between [[cooperative federalism|co-operative federalism]] and co-operative individualism. In an Owenite village of cooperation or a [[Commune (intentional community)|commune]], the residents would be both the producers and consumers of its products. However, for a co-operative, the producers and consumers of its products become two different groups of people, and thus, there are two different sets of people who could be defined here as its 'users', but are generally referred to as the co-op's \"members\". As a result, we can define two different modes of co-operative organisation: [[consumers' cooperative]], in which the consumers of a co-operative's goods and services are defined as its users (including food co-operatives, credit unions, etc.), [[Worker cooperative|producer co-operatives]], in which the producers of a co-operatives goods and services are defined as its users. (Some consider worker co-operatives, which are owned and run exclusively by their worker owners as a third class, others view this as part of the producer category.) <!-- (which includes [[worker co-operative]], agricultural producer co-operatives, etc.)This is not true. Worker Co-operatives are owned by their workers. Producer co-ops are owned by the owners of the farm, the cheese production, etc, whereever production is taking place. These farms are not required, and are rarely in actuality, owned by workers. For more on this go to the worker co-operative wiki page --> .\n\nThis in turn led to a debate between those who support Consumers' Co-operatives (known as the [[Cooperative Federalism|Co-operative Federalists]]) and those who favor Producers Co-operatives (pejoratively labelled \u2018Individualist' co-operativists by the Federalists<ref>Lewis, p. 244.<\/ref> ).<ref>This analysis is based on a discussion by Gide, Charles; as translated from French by the Co-operative Reference Library, Dublin, \"Consumers' CoOperative Societies\", Manchester: The Cooperative Union Limited, 1921, pp. 192-203.<\/ref>\n\n=== Co-operative federalism ===\nCo-operative Federalism is the school of thought favouring consumer co-operative societies. Historically, its proponents have included [[JTW Mitchell]] and [[Charles Gide]], as well as [[Paul Lambart]] and [[Beatrice Webb]]. The co-operative federalists argue that consumers should form [[cooperative wholesale society|co-operative wholesale societies]] ([[Cooperative Federation|Co-operative Federations]] in which all members are co-operators, the best historical example of which being [[The Co-operative Group|CWS]] in the [[United Kingdom]]), and that these co-operative wholesale societies should undertake purchasing farms or factories. They argue that profits (or surpluses) from these co-operative wholesale societies should be paid as [[dividends]] to the member co-operators, rather than to their workers.<ref name=\"autogenerated192\">This analysis is based on a discussion by Gide, Charles, pp. 192-203.<\/ref>\n\n=== Co-operative Individualism ===\nCo-operative Individualism is the school of thought favouring workers' co-operative societies.  The most notable proponents of this latter being, in Britain, the [[Christian Socialists]], and later writers like [[Joseph Reeves]], putting this forth as a path to [[State Socialism]].<ref>Reeves, Joseph, \u201cA Century of Rochdale Cooperation 1844-1944\u201d, London: Lawrence & Wishart, 1944.<\/ref> Where the Co-operative Federalists argue for federations in which consumer co-operators federate, and receive the monetary [[dividend]]s, rather, in [[Co-operative wholesale society|co-operative wholesale societies]] the profits (or surpluses) would be paid as dividends to their workers.<ref name=\"autogenerated192\"\/> The [[Mondrag\u00f3n Cooperative Corporation|Mondrag\u00f3n Co-operatives]] are an economic model commonly cited by Co-operative Individualists, and a lot of the Co-operative Individualist literature deals with these societies.\n\nPlease note that these two schools of thought are not necessarily in binary opposition a priori, and that hybrids between the two positions are possible.<ref name=\"autogenerated192\"\/>\n\nJames Warbasse's work,<ref>Warbasse, J. (1936) ''Cooperative Democracy''<\/ref> and more recently Johnston Birchall's,<ref>Birchall, J. (1997) ''The International Co-operative Movement''<\/ref> provide perspectives on the breadth of co-operative development nationally and internationally.  Benjamin Ward provided a formal treatment to begin an evaluation of \"market syndicalism.\"  Jaroslav Vanek wrote a comprehensive work in an attempt to address cooperativism in economic terms and a \"labor-managed economy.\"<ref>Vanek, J. (1970) ''General Theory of Labor-Managed Economies'.'<\/ref>  David Ellerman began by considering legal philosophic aspects of co-operatives, developing the \"labor theory of property.\"<ref>Ellerman, D. (1989) ''The Democratic Worker-Owned Firm''<\/ref>  In 2007 he used the classical economic premise in formulating his argument deconstructing the myth of capital rights to ownership.<ref>Ellerman, D. (2007) \"On the Role of Capital in 'Capitalist' and Labor-Managed Firms,\" ''Review of Radical Political Economics''<\/ref> Anna Milford has constructed a detailed theoretical examination of co-operatives in controlled buyer markets (monopsony), and the implications for Fair Trade strategies.<ref>Milford, A. (2004) \"Coffee, Cooperatives, Competition: The Impact of Fair Trade,\" ''Chr Michelsen Institute''<\/ref>\n\n==Other schools==\n\n=== Retailers' cooperatives ===\nIn addition to customer vs. worker ownership, [[retailers' cooperative]]s also utilize organizations of already constituted corporations as collective owners of the produce.\n\n===Socialism and left-wing anarchism===\n[[Socialism|Socialists]] and [[left anarchism|left-anarchists]], such as [[anarchist communism|anarcho-communists]] and [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalists]], view society as one big cooperative, and feel that goods produced by all should be distributed equitably to all members of the society, not necessarily through a market. All the members of a society are considered to be both producers and consumers. [[State socialism|State socialists]] tend to favor government administration of the economy, while left-anarchists and [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] favor non-governmental coordination, either locally, or through [[labor union]]s and [[worker cooperative]]s.\n\n[[Utopian socialists]] feel socialism can be achieved without [[class struggle]] and that cooperatives should only include those who voluntarily choose to participate in them. Some participants in the [[kibbutz]] movement and other [[intentional communities]] fall into this category.\n\n===Co-operative commonwealth===\nIn some Co-operative economics literature, the aim is the achievement of a Co-operative Commonwealth; a society based on [[cooperative]] and [[socialist]] principles. Co-operative economists - Federalist, Individualist, and otherwise - have presented the extension of their economic model to its natural limits as a goal.\n\nThis ideal was widely supported in early-twentieth century U.S. and Canadian leftist circles.  This ideal, and the language behind it,  were central to the formation of the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] party in 1932, which became Canada's largest left-wing political party, and continues to this day as the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]]. They were also important to the economic principles of the [[Farmer-Labor Party|Farmer-Labor Party of the United States]], particularly in the FLP's [[Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party|Minnesota affiliate]], where advocacy for a Co-operative Commonwealth formed the central theme of the Party's platform from 1934, until the Minnesota FLP merged with the state [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] to form the [[Minnesota Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party|Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party]] in 1944.\n\nCo-operative Commonwealth ideas were also developed in Great Britain and Ireland from the 1880s by William Morris which also inspired the Guild socialist movement for associative democracy from 1906 right through the 1920s. Guild socialism thinkers included Bertrand Russell, R.H. Tawney and G.D.H. Cole.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Cooperatives}}\n*[[Economic democracy]]\n*[[History of the cooperative movement]]\n*[[Market socialism]]\n*[[Rochdale Principles]]\n*[[Syndicalism]]\n*[[Cooperative Stock Market]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[http:\/\/fax.libs.uga.edu\/HD3271xG453\/ ''Consumers' Co-operative Societies''], by [[Charles Gide]], 1922\n*[http:\/\/fax.libs.uga.edu\/HD2951xC776\/ ''Co-operation 1921-1947''], published monthly by The [[Co-operative League of America]]\n*[http:\/\/fax.libs.uga.edu\/HD3486xH7\/ ''The History of Co-operation''], by [[George Jacob Holyoake]], 1908\n*[http:\/\/abob.libs.uga.edu\/bobk\/coopp.html ''Cooperative Peace''], by [[James Peter Warbasse]], 1950\n*[http:\/\/fax.libs.uga.edu\/HD2965xW37\/ ''Problems Of Cooperation''], by [[James Peter Warbasse]], 1941\n*[http:\/\/www.historians.org\/projects\/GIRoundtable\/Coops\/Coops_TOC.htm ''Why Co-ops?

The first [[prototype]] engine, the XF3, was manufactured in 1981 and first flew in the XT-4 in July 1985.\n\n==Design and development==\nIshikawajima-Harima began developing a small turbofan engine in the late 1970s as a competitor for the new jet trainer aircraft being developed by [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]]. The developmental engine was named the XF3, and it was selected over the [[SNECMA Turbomeca Larzac]] in 1982 to power the [[Kawasaki T-4|XT-4]] trainer. The early developmental models of the engine produced {{convert|2600|lbf|kN}} of [[thrust]], but later models (including the model selected for the XT-4) produced {{convert|3600|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} of thrust.<ref>[http:\/\/www.flightglobal.com\/pdfarchive\/view\/1982\/1982%20-%202707.html Japanese trainer engine selected].

Accessed February 4, 2010.<\/ref>\n\nThe production engine was designated the F3-30 (alternatively, the F3-IHI-30), and it first flew in the XT-4 aircraft in 1985.

This updated engine was designated the ''F3-IHI-30C''.<ref name=\"janes\"\/>\n\n===XF3-400===\nSoon after IHI began working on the XF-3, they began developing a more powerful variant of the engine as a technology demonstrator for a theoretical [[Supersonic aircraft|supersonic]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]]. This engine was designated the XF3-400. It was designed to be a higher performance, [[Afterburner|afterburning]] version of the XF-3, producing around {{convert|7600|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} of thrust. One distinctive quality of this engine was that it was to have a [[thrust-to-weight ratio]] of 7:1, higher than any similarly sized engine.<ref name=\"-400\">Kashikawa, I., & Akagi, M. (1995). Research on a High Thrust-to-Weight Ratio Small Turbofan Engine. Presented at the 31st AlAA\/ASME\/SAE\/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit, San Diego, CA: American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.<\/ref>\n\nWork on this engine began in earnest in 1986, and a demonstrator engine was built and tested in 1987. IHI was formally awarded a contract for the engine in 1992, after spending the previous years developing and testing the engine internally.<ref name=\"-400\"\/>\n\nThe primary difference between the XF3-400 and the standard F3-30 is the inclusion of an [[afterburner]]. Adding the afterburner is the primary reason why the maximum thrust of the -400 is much higher than the -30. Other changes included [[Axial compressor|compressor]] and turbine blades that were aerodynamically optimized using 3D [[computational fluid dynamics]] techniques, and improved temperature performance in the high pressure turbine.<ref name=\"-400\"\/>\n\nA 1998 report revealed that [[thrust vectoring]] was also being integrated into the XF3-400.<ref>[http:\/\/www.flightglobal.com\/articles\/1998\/10\/21\/44062\/japan-stalls-future-fighter-demonstrator.html Japan stalls future fighter demonstrator]. (1998, October 21). Flight International. Retrieved February 4, 2010.<\/ref>\n\n===Design===\nThe F3 is a two-shaft (or two spool) low-bypass [[turbofan]]. It features a two-stage fan (low-pressure compressor) on the low-pressure shaft, followed by a five-stage high-pressure compressor on the high-pressure shaft. The engine uses an [[Combustor#Annular type|annular combustor]], which feeds a single-stage high-pressure turbine followed by a single-stage low-pressure turbine. The XF3-400 variant includes an afterburner after the low-pressure turbine, the production F3 does not.<ref name=\"-400\"\/>\n\nThe two-stage fan uses wide chord blades, and both the production F3 and the advanced XF3-400 use the same fan.<ref name=\"test\"\/><ref name=\"-400\"\/> Unlike the fan, the five-stage compressor differs between the F3 and the XF3-400, with the advanced XF3-400 benefiting from 3D [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) improvements.<ref name=\"-400\"\/>\n\nThe high-pressure turbine blades are [[single crystal|single-crystal]] blades, and they are cooled by a thin film of air from inside of the blades. The low-pressure turbine blades, like the high-pressure compressor, were improved between the F3 and the XF3-400 using 3D CFD.<ref name=\"-400\"\/>\n\nBoth the F3 and the XF3-400 use a FADEC for engine control.<ref name=\"-400\"\/>\n\n==Variants==\n;XF3\n:Early developmental designation of what became the F3-IHI-30.

He was also a brother of [[Phi Kappa Tau]].\n\nDuring his four-year career with Yankees, he played for the Yankees in the second and last games of the [[1943 World Series]] as the Yankees defeated the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] and he played with such great players as [[Joe DiMaggio|DiMaggio]], [[Phil Rizzuto|Rizzuto]] and [[Bill Dickey|Dickey]]. In the minors before joining the Yankees, Metheny won pennants with Norfolk and the [[Kansas City Blues (American Association)|Kansas City Blues]], as well as the [[Little World Series]] with the [[Newark Bears]].\n\nMetheny joined the Old Dominion athletic staff in 1948 as head baseball coach, compiling a 423\u2013363\u20136 record before retiring in 1980. He was honored by the [[NCAA]] as the Eastern Regional Coach of the Year in 1963 and 1964, a period when his Monarchs captured college division crowns.

In this case the question of whether {{tl|infobox website}} needs a political affiliation parameter (along with potentially some others) was begged by removing it from all the transclusions. It would be best to undo those merges for now. At the very least, a temporary conversion into a wrapper which takes the affiliation parameter and adds the contents to the <code>type<\/code> parameter in the parent would seem sensible, as otherwise very little of the ''what'' in a weblog article is really being presented in its infobox (type: \"blog\", along with loads of trivia on foundation and content licensing).

Well, they can! I'll explain to you how this works.\n\nThere are a few items you will need for this to work.\n\nItem 1) A puppy pad holder.\n[[File:Puppy pad holder|thumbnail|left]]\n\nItem 2) Puppy Pads\n[[File:Pads|thumbnail|left]]\n\nItem 3) bricks\n[[File:Bricks|thumbnail|left]]\n\nItem 4)Pheromone spray\n[[File:Pheromone|thumbnail|left]]\n\nItem 5) Stairs\n[[File:Stairs|thumbnail|left]]\n\nI highly recommend stairs if you're training a puppy or a clumsy dog.\n\nYou start out with putting a puppy pad on the pad holder, the holder will make sure your pup cannot move the pad around. Plus you'll need the holder later on. If your puppy pads do not have the built in pheromone, spray some pheromone spray in the middle of the pad. Place the pad and pad holder in the washroom that you want your dog to use, or in every washroom in your house.\n\nI suggest putting up gates and closing doors to keep the puppy in the area of no carpet and the washroom until the pup understands.\n\nShow your puppy the pad, if the puppy uses it then praise it and stroke it, if the pup uses the floor, do not yell. Pick the pup up and place it on the pad, then clean up the mess. The pup will learn that pad = Attention and No pad = No attention.\n\nTry this for a couple of days, and then move the pad holder and pads near the toilet. Wait two days.\n\nPut 1 brick under each side of the pad holder, wait three days. Keep adding bricks until it gets to toilet height (this is where you need the stairs.)\n\n\nAfter the pup is used to being up that high and using the pad, put the pad holder on your toilet with the seat up. Put the stairs in front and show the pup where it got moved to. If this doesn't work, go back and step and wait a little longer, then try again. Once the pup recognizes that it's there, you can try putting the seat down. Make sure the pad is still there and the pheromone is sprayed in the middle. \n\nYou can move it when a human has to use the washroom.\n\nOnce you think it has been long enough, you can try taking the pad and pad holder away. For extra caution, you can spray the pheromone into the toilet. If your pup doesn't understand, take a step back and do it again.\n\nSoon, you'll be able to stop rewarding the action, and your pup will just do it on his\/her own.\n\nYour dog is then officially toilet trained! You'll never have to go outside in -20 degree weather again.","timestamp":"20160410103342","user-timestamp":"20150410103342"},{"title":"Talk:Siege of Edessa","content":"{{WPMILHIST\n|class=Start\n|attention=\n|collaboration-candidate=\n|past-collaboration=\n|peer-review= \n|old-peer-review=\n|Aviation-task-force=\n|British-task-force=\n|Canadian-task-force=\n|Chinese-task-force=\n|Classical-task-force=\n|French-task-force=\n|Memorials-task-force=\n|Crusades-task-force=yes\n|Napoleonic-task-force=\n|Polish-task-force=\n|US-task-force=\n|Weaponry-task-force=\n|WWI-task-force=\n|WWII-task-force=\n}}\n\n{{WPMA|Crusades-task-force=yes}}","timestamp":"20160410103343","user-timestamp":"20150410103343"},{"title":"Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Ryan griffiths","content":"<div class=\"boilerplate\" class=\"metadata\" class=\"vfd\" style=\"background-color: #F3F9FF; margin: 0 auto; padding: 0 10px 0 10px; border: 1px solid #AAAAAA; \">\nThis page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below.

Detroit bishop [[Peter Paul Lefevere|Peter Paul Lefev\u00e8re]] established the parish of St. Augustine and appointed a permanent pastor in a letter from dated January 22, 1856.  However, by 1869, the structure was no longer safe and inadequate for the growing congregation.  It was replaced by a new church on the same site.  \n\nIn 1883, Father Francis O'Brien became pastor and oversaw construction of a convent, school and rectory.  He invited the [[Sisters of St. Joseph]] to Kalamazoo and aided them in establishing Borgess Hospital in 1889.\n\nIn 1937, the parish became part of the newly created [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lansing|Diocese of Lansing]].  Construction of the current church began in 1950 and Lansing [[Bishop]] [[Joseph H. Albers]] consecrated it December 4, 1951.\n\n[[Pope Paul VI]] created the Diocese of Kalamazoo December 19, 1970, from portions of the Diocese of Lansing and the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Grand Rapids|Diocese of Grand Rapids]].  He selected St. Augustine as the cathedral and the Most Rev. [[Paul Vincent Donovan|Paul Donovan]] was installed as the first bishop on June 15, 1971.  \n\nThe entire St. Augustine campus includes an activities center, named the Fr. Crowley Cathedral Center, the St. Augustine Cathedral School, and the Cathedral itself.  \n\nThe church and school were severely damaged in 1980 when a tornado struck the area.

I turned to shuki many times - and left him messages so we can discuss this matter, including sending him an e-mail, reminding him to respond to my [[User talk:Shuki#The return to zion|posted message at his talk page]] - but have got no answer.\n\nSo I'd like to turn to some administrator, in order to discuss this matter and solve the issue. \n\nfirat, as i wrote on my posted message to shuki - i had translated this article from Hebrew - (also- in consistence with the article [[Pre-Zionist Aliyah]] wich also seem to match it's Hebrew article).\n\n\"The gathering of israel\" - was put in the Hebrew wikipedia as a different subject to \"the return to Zion\" - since it \"gathering\" is the promise of exile and return - and \"the return to Zion\" is a different term by itself - which is only one of the fulfillment of this promise of return (there were other exiles and return - who are subject to different articles). \"The Return to Zion\" also has other related topics of Aliyah and modern Zionism etc - not specifically concerning the promise of exile and return.\n\nIn addition, after shuki's tagging - I had linked \"the gathering of Israel\" to the Hebrew article - and had asked him to see for himself that they put it on a different article then \"the return to Zion\", again couldn't get his answer.\n\nSecond, the article is not an original research, had it been so, i wouldn't have translated it from hebew - look at the Hebrew link i put to \"the return to Zion\" - Hebrew wikipedia has not tagged it this \"original research\". I also referred on my references to :\n\n* Book of Ezra \n* Book of Nehemiah \n\nwich the article is based upon - I just can't think, in case of article on the bible,  of a more \"reliable source\" then the bible itself ? ... \n\nthird, the article \"pre-zionist Aliyah\" is also translated from the Hebrew article (or at list in consistence with the Hebrew article) - but \"pre-Zionist aliyah\" has no references at all and it was not tagged - in contra to my article - wich both is in with consistence with the \"Hebrew- the return to Zion\", the \"English + Hebrew - pre Zionist aliyah\" as well as has the references of which the article is based up on and those are:\n\n* Book of Ezra \n* Book of Nehemiah \n\ni'd like to ask the administrator to remove those tags.

Asking to do so with the article of \"gathering of Israel\" \u2013 is like asking to \"merge\" ''Ben-Gurion'' article to the ''state of Israel'' article, which both are <u>related topics<\/u>, yet subject to different articles, as well as trying to \"merge\" \u2013''Aliyah'' with ''First Aliyah'' for example, \u2013 which doesn\u2019t make any sense \u2013 since the former is the definition and the latter is a practical event. \n\n::Second, \"The Return to Zion\" is such a big piece of History in Judaism 101, Zionism 101 and Aliyah 101, as well as a unique act in Human History, that I can't imagine it not as a \"stand alone\" as much as I can not imagine Ben Gurion article not to be a \"stand alone\" - outside of Zionism or Israel or <u>many<\/u> other <u>related topics<\/u>.\n\n::Third, in addition to what I have written to [[user:Stefan]] (see the above message), the article [[Pre-Zionist Aliyah]], has prepared in advance a link to a future article of \" The Return to Zion\", which I had picked upon and written this article (as I had told stefan, the \"English-The Return to Zion\" article is in consistence with the article of the  Hebrew + English \"Pre-Zionist Aliyah\" - and both are in consistence with the \"Hebrew- the return to Zion\" article,\u2013 as well as fits into the Hebrew +English  table of timelines of  \"Aliyah and settelment in Israel\"-see body of \"The Return to Zion\" article) \n\n::Forth, the Hebrew wikipedia had not combined the \"Henrew-Gathering of Israel\" (Kibbutz Galuyot) article with the \"Hebrew-The Return to Zion\" article for the reasons I had laid above, and especially for the \"Gathering of Israel\" being a definition of a future term of many returns and Aliyot, rather then \"The Return to Zion\" as being just one of practicalities in a series of returns and Aliyot. The Hebrew Wikipedia has not even linked it as \"See Also\" (and it did not even come to my mind to do so in the English article of \"The Return to Zion\"). Both are important part of History and are subject to different articles (\"The Return to Zion\" is even more so because the event itself had tremendous influence over Jewish national aspiration, Identity and modern Zionism ever since the Babylonian exile).\n\n::Fifth, I'd like to suggest something completely different. The article \"Gathering of Israel\" \u2013 which talks about a story in Exodus (if I'm not mistaken) \u2013 which besides being a kind of a \"definition\" to what would become future term of returns and Aliyot, whereas the \"The Return to Zion\", in a different timeline of the book of Ezra and Book of Nehemiah, on the latter part of the bible, is only one in the series of returns and Aliyot (See Hebrew +English table of timelines of ''Aliyah and settlement in Israel'' in the body of the article):\n\n::Since Hebrew +English \"Pre-Zionist Aliyah\" are in consistence with Hebrew +English \"The Return to Zion\" \u2013 whereas the English \"Gathering of Israel\" is not in consistence with the Hebrew article (Kibbutz Galuyot), I'd like to translate the Hebrew \"Kibbutz Galuyot\" (Gathering of Israel) and turn all those circle of article to be one series of article that will be in consistence with each other (and I'll put the current content of \"Gathering of Israel\" as an \"external link\").\n\n::In order to so, and in consistence with the separate articles of the \"Hebrew-The Return to Zion\" article and the \"Hebrew-Gathering of Israel\" (Kibbutz Galuyot) article (see the Hebrew link I have provided to the English article of \"Gathering of Israel) \u2013I'd like to ask you to remove the \"merge\" tag. After removing the \"merge\" tag, you may try to find some other solutions to the English \"Gathering of Israel\" article, other then my offer of help in translation (I suggest \"The Gathering of Israel\" will remain as a \"stand alone\" as well. The fact that \"The Gathering of Israel\" doesn't have \"reliable sources\" shouldn't make one conclude that the sources would some how \"be improved\" by \"merging\" it with another different topic-article, but rather the solution is either adding on \"reliable sources\" or re-writing a new article that does have reliable sources \u2013 as I have offered my help on the issue)\n\n::See Also: \n::*[[Aliyah#Immigration from 1948-1950]]\n::*[http:\/\/www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org\/jsource\/glossK.html Jewish Virtual Library - Glossary- Kibbutz Galuyot]\n::*[http:\/\/www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org\/jsource\/Judaism\/return.html Jewish Virtual Library - The Return to Zion]\n::*See [http:\/\/www.google.com\/ Google]: \"[http:\/\/www.google.com\/search?hl=en&q=the+return+to+zion The Return to Zion]\" and \"[http:\/\/www.google.com\/search?hl=en&q=Kibbutz+Galuyot Kibbutz Galuyot]\" apear on different terms, topics and articles.  <small>\u2014Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Shevashalosh|Shevashalosh]] ([[User talk:Shevashalosh|talk]] \u2022 [[Special:Contributions\/Shevashalosh|contribs]]) 00:28, 11 June 2008 (UTC)<\/small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\n\n\n::ThanX!\n\n::--[[User:Shevashalosh|Shevashalosh]] ([[User talk:Shevashalosh|talk]]) 13:49, 10 June 2008 (UTC)\n==File:Cyrus cilinder.jpg Nominated for Deletion==\n{|\n|-\n| [[File:Image-x-generic.svg|100px]] \n| An image used in this article, [[commons:File:Cyrus cilinder.jpg|File:Cyrus cilinder.jpg]], has been nominated for deletion at [[Wikimedia Commons]] in the following category: ''Deletion requests October 2011'' \n;What should I do?\n''Don't panic''; a discussion will now take place over on Commons about whether to remove the file.

Part of the [[Idol series|''Idol'' franchise]], it was as a spin-off from the UK show ''[[Pop Idol]]''.\n\nThe concept of the series is to find new solo recording artists where the winner is determined by the viewers. Through telephone and [[Short message service|SMS text]] voting, viewers have chosen as winners [[Joy Tobing]], [[Mike Mohede]], [[:id:Ihsan Tarore|Ihsan Tarore]], [[Rini Wulandari]], [[Januarisman|Aris Runtuwene]], [[:id:Igo Pentury|Igo Pentury]] and [[:id:Regina Ivanova|Regina Ivanova]] (listed in chronological order).\n\nThe series employs a panel of judges who critique the contestants' performances. The original four judges were [[Anugerah Musik Indonesia|AMI]] Awards-winning [[jazz]] musician [[Indra Lesmana]], [[Anugerah Musik Indonesia|AMI]] Awards-winning pop singer [[Titi DJ]], [[Radio announcer]] and [[presenter]] [[Meuthia Kasim]] and video director Dimas Djayadiningrat. The judging panel currently consists of musician and solo singer Anang Hermansyah, musician and artist manager [[Ahmad Dhani]], Kotak vocalist Tantri, and [[Anugerah Musik Indonesia|AMI]] Awards-winning pop singer [[Titi DJ]]. Other judges who have been a part of the show are television presenter [[Indy Barends]], [[MTV]] video jockey and comedian [[Jamie Aditya]], musician and conductor [[Erwin Gutawa]], Indonesian Superstar [[Agnes Monica]] and hits-maker [[Ahmad Dhani]].\n\nThe show was originally hosted by radio DJ [[Amelia Natasha]] and TV host Irgi Ahmad Fahrezy. In 2006, [[Daniel Mananta]] replaced Irgi as the main host and [[Dewi Sandra]] replaced Ata in 2008. Since 2010, Daniel Mananta was the only host for this program.\n\nIndonesian Idol won the 2005 and 2006 [[Panasonic Awards]] for the Best Music Variety Show. It also defeated its rival, [[Akademi Fantasi Indosiar]], known locally as [[La Academia|AFI]], but in 2004 AFI won the Best Reality Show award in Panasonic Awards 2004.  [[Singapore Tourism Board]] also rewarded Indonesian Idol Season 1 by inviting the Top 11 contestants of to the [[American Idol]] World Tour there. Joy, the winner of season 1, was the opening singer of the concert.\n\nBut after the fifth season, the event was discontinued because of declining ratings, and resumed its sixth season in 2010. The seventh season was held in 2012 and rapidly became the most successful season in the history of ''Indonesian Idol''. Originally planned to be replaced by UK hit [[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]] in 2013, both shows will still are broadcast on every alternating year.\n\nIn 2014, Indonesian Idol decreased. And in the next year, precisely in November 2015, Indonesian Idol programs otherwise been removed from the list of programs RCTI and replaced in the presence of [[The Voice Indonesia]] are considered more popular in the world.\n\n==Judges and hosts==\nThe show had originally four judges, namely Indra Lesmana, Titi DJ, Meuthia Kasim and Dimas Djayadiningrat aka Dimas Djay. In season three, [[Radio announcer]] and [[presenter]] [[Indy Barends]] replaced Meuthia Kasim because of Meuthia's health. Indy stayed only for one season and left the show before season four. In season four, [[MTV]] video jockey and comedian [[Jamie Aditya]] replaced Indy Barends and musician and solo singer Anang Hermansyah replaced Dimas Djay who left the panel after three seasons. In season five, Jamie left the panel and only three judges, Indra, Titi and Anang were the judges. In 2010, Indra Lesmana and Titi DJ left the panel and replaced by musician and conductor [[Erwin Gutawa]] and Indonesian Superstar [[Agnes Monica]]. And in 2012, the last season of Indonesian Idol, Anang Hermansyah and Agnes Monica return as judges, while musician and hits-maker [[Ahmad Dhani]] replaced Erwin Gutawa in the panel.\n\nGuest judges may occasionally be introduced. In season one, guest judge was Krisdayanti. In season two, [[Yovie Widianto]]<ref>{{Cite news| first=Ine| last=Yordenaya| title=Yovie Keluar, Dimas Djay Masuk Lagi| date=26 May 2005|publisher=DetikHot| url=http:\/\/www.detikhot.com\/read\/2005\/05\/26\/211554\/369194\/231\/yovie-keluar-dimas-djay-masuk-lagi}}<\/ref> replaced Dimas Djay and [[Ahmad Dhani]]<ref>{{Cite news| first=Puteri| last=Fatia| title=Ahmad Dhani Gantikan Meuthia Kasim di Indonesian Idol| date=8 July 2005|publisher=DetikHot| url=http:\/\/www.detikhot.com\/read\/2005\/07\/08\/171558\/399410\/231\/ahmad-dhani-gantikan-meuthia-kasim-di-indonesian-idol}}<\/ref> replaced Meuthia Kasim in any cities audition.

As a result, her place as the 1st ''Indonesian Idol'' winner was granted to runner-up Delon Thamrin.\n\n==Selection process==\nIn a series of steps, the show selects the eventual winner out of many tens of thousands of contestants.\n\n===Contestant eligibility===\nThe eligible age-range for contestants is currently 16\u201327 years old. The initial age limit was 18\u201325 in the first season. The upper limit was raised to 29 in season 5, and then reduced to 27 in season 5. The lower limit was reduced to 16 in season 2. The contestants must be legal Indonesia residents, and must not hold any current recording or talent representation contract by the semi-final stage.\n\n===Initial auditions===\nContestants go through at least three sets of cuts. The first is a brief audition with a few other contestants in front of selectors which may include one of the show's producers. The number of auditionees can exceed 10,000 people each city, but only a few hundreds in each city may make it past this round of preliminary auditions. Successful auditionees then sing in front of producers where more may be cut. Only then can they proceed to audition in front of the judges, which is the only audition stage shown on the show.\n\n===Elimination===\nOnce in Elimination, the contestants perform individually or in groups in a series of rounds.  For most years there were eliminations in three rounds by the judges.  In the first round the contestants emerged in groups but performed individually. For the next round, the contestants split themselves up into small groups and perform a song together.  In the final round, the contestants perform solo with a song of their choice [[a cappella]] or accompanied by a band depending on the season. At the end of the Elimination round, 24\u201332 contestants were selected to move on to the workshop round.\n\n===Audience voting===\nFrom the Workshop round, the fate of the contestants is decided by public vote. During the contestant's performance as well as the recap at the end, a [[toll-free telephone number]] for each contestant is displayed on the screen. Viewers may call or send a text message to their preferred contestant's telephone number, and each call or text message is registered as a vote for that contestant. Viewers are allowed to vote as many times as they can within the two-hour voting window, however, the show reserves the right to discard votes by power dialer.\n\n===Workshop===\nIn the first two seasons, as well as season six, the semi-finalists were split into different groups to perform individually in their respective night. In season one, there were three groups of ten, with the top three contestants from each group making the finals. In season three until five, the girls and boys perform on separate nights and five of each were chosen. These six seasons also featured a wildcard round where contestants who failed to qualify were given another chance. In season one, two wildcard contestant were chosen by the judges (originally one), giving a total of eleven finalists. In seasons two, there were 12 contestants no wildcard. In season three, 2 contestants were chosen by wildcard.\n\nFrom seasons four to seven, as well as season nine, the 24 semi-finalists were divided by gender in order to ensure an equal gender division in the top 12. The men and women sang separately on consecutive nights, and the bottom two in each groups were eliminated each week until only six of each remained to form the top 12.\n\n==Overview==\n\n===Auditions===\nThere were 2 rounds of auditions which usually took place in large convention halls where thousands of people waited in line. The first round judges were the [[Sony BMG]] people. Those who pass the first round of preliminary auditions continued to audition in front of the Indonesian Idol main judges. Contestants were required to sing [[a cappella]] with poor singers often facing intense and humbling criticism from the judges. Typically the judges express disgust or dismay or suppressed laughter. Those who impress the majority of the judges, move on to the elimination round which take place in Jakarta. Usually only 150 to 170 contestants get through to the elimination round in Jakarta.\n\nContestants had to be Indonesian citizens . For the first season, contestants were required to be between the ages 18 to 24 years old. In order to increase variety, in the second and third season the age requirement was lowered from 18 to 16 and the upper age limit was raised from 24 to 28. As a result there were many teenagers that made it to the final 12 such as Monita and Vira  from the second season and also Tesa, Brinet, Christy, Ihsan, Gea and Dirly from the third season. For the fifth season, the eligible age-range for contestants were 17 to 29.\n\n===Elimination Round===\nThere were 3 elimination rounds. In the first elimination round, 170 contestants from around Indonesia were separated in 17 groups of 10 contestants. In the 2nd elimination round, male and female contestants were paired and sang duets. In the last elimination round the remaining contestants sang their choice of song alone in front of the judges. The judges then inform them whether they have made it onto the stage show or not.\n\n===Workshop Round===\n\n====Season 1====\nIn the first season, 30 contestants were separated in groups of 10 and every week three contestants from each group were chosen to the Top 10 or The Spectacular Show. Audiences vote their favorites by SMS and Premium Calls. After 9 contestants were chosen, there was a wild card round. Only one contestant from the Wild Card round could join the 9 contestants at the Spectacular Show. [[Karen Theresia Pooroe]] won the most audience votes, advancing to the Top 10. Although the spectacular show was supposed to have a set of 10 contestants,<ref>[http:\/\/www.kafegaul.com\/musik\/article.php?cat=5&id=21706 Beda Dengan Yang Udah Ada]. Retrieved 6 July 2010<\/ref> the judges announced at the last minute that they would be advancing a second wild card\/eleventh contestant, [[Lucky Octavian]], as well.\n\n====Season 2====\nIn the second season, there was no Wild Card round. 24 contestants were separated into groups of 8. Every week, 4 contestants were picked to move on to the Top 12.\n\n====Season 3====\nFor the third season, the workshop stage consisted of three rounds each for male and female contestants. There were 28 contestants that made it to the workshop stage on the third season. In the first week, eight contestants (four males and four females) were sent home. Six contestants (three males and three females) were sent home in the second week, and the final workshop eliminated four more contestants (two males and two females). Before the spectacular round, pre-gala and wild card show was held. Four of the eliminated contestants were chosen by the judges and two of them, one male and one female, were given a place in the Spectacular Show based on voting result.\n\n====Season 6====\nThe sixth season saw several changes to the format of the show. There were 14 finalists instead of 12. On the Workshop round, 24 semifinalists were divided into 2 groups. Each consists of 6 male and 6 females. Four contestants of each group got voted off in the first and second week, two in third, fourth and fifth week respectively until resulting the top 10 contestants who filled 10 of 14 spots on the Spectacular Shows. The judges selected 8 of the previously eliminated 14 semifinalists to compete in the Wild Card round. Two contestants were picked based on votes by the viewers while the other two were selected by the judges. A total of four contestants (two males and two females) advanced to the final group of 14.\n\n===Spectacular Show===\nThe Spectacular Show, which lasted eleven weeks, each finalist performed a song live (two in the top 4 and top 3 and three in the finale) in prime time with a weekly theme at Balai Sarbini Concert Hall in Jakarta in front of live audiences. Unlike [[American Idol]], Indonesian Idol's Result Show is conducted about 1-hour after the Spectacular Show. For the Grand Final, the Result Show was conducted 7 days after the Grand Final. In the Result Show, some finalists who get the fewest votes are put in the bottom three or bottom two. Each week, finalist with the fewest votes is sent home. This process was repeated each week until the one remaining contestant is declared the winner.\n\n''Indonesian Idol'''s famous sentence for the result is ''Indonesia Memilih!''

Another change in the format, which was revealed on the fourth week of the Spectacular Show, is the one-time veto power for the judges to save a contestant who was eliminated by the viewers' votes.\n\n====Elimination chart====\n<center>\n{| border=\"2\" style=\"border:1px solid gray; border-collapse:collapse;\"\n| style=\"background:#FFFF99; padding-left: 1em;\" width=\"20%\" | Safe First\n| bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\" style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" width=\"20%\" | Safe Second\n| style=\"background:#FFFF00; padding-left: 1em;\" width=\"20%\" | Out\n| style=\"background:gold;\" width=\"20%\"| <center>Judges' Save <sup>2<\/sup><\/center>\n|}\n<\/center>\n<center>\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|colspan=\"2\" align=\"right\"|''Stage''\n|colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\" align=\"Center\"|'''Spectacular'''\n|colspan=\"1\" bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\" align=\"Center\"|'''Finale'''\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" align=\"right\"|''Week:''\n!5\/14\n!5\/21<sup>1<\/sup>\n!5\/28\n!6\/4<sup>2<\/sup>\n!6\/12<sup>3<\/sup>\n!6\/18\n!6\/25\n!7\/2\n!7\/9<sup>4<\/sup>\n!7\/16\n!7\/23\n!8\/7\n|-\n!Ranking\n!Contestant\n!colspan=\"15\" align=\"center\"|Result\n|-\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\"|1\n|bgcolor=\"cyan\"|Igo Pentury\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|bgcolor=\"FFFF99\" align=\"center\"|Btm 3\n|\n|\n|bgcolor=\"FFFF99\" align=\"center\"|Btm 3\n|\n|bgcolor=\"FFFF99\" align=\"center\"|Btm 3\n|bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\" align=\"center\"|Btm 2\n|bgcolor=\"lime\" align=\"center\"|{{nowrap|'''Winner'''}}\n|-\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\"|2\n|bgcolor=\"pink\"|Citra Scholastika\n|\n|\n|\n|bgcolor=\"FFFF99\" align=\"center\"|Btm 3\n|bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\" align=\"center\"|Btm 3\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\" align=\"center\"|{{nowrap|'''Runner Up'''}}\n|-\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\"|3\n|bgcolor=\"cyan\"|Gilang Saputra\n|\n|\n|bgcolor=\"FFFF99\" align=\"center\"|Btm 3\n|\n|\n|\n|bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\" align=\"center\"|Btm 3\n|bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\" align=\"center\"|Btm 3\n|bgcolor=\"FFFF99\" align=\"center\"|Btm 3\n|bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\" align=\"center\"|Btm 3\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"yellow\"|'''Out'''\n|colspan=\"4\" bgcolor=\"666666\"|\n|-\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\"|4\n|bgcolor=\"cyan\"|Ray Generies\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|bgcolor=\"gold\" align=\"center\"|Safe<sup>5<\/sup>\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"yellow\"|'''Out'''\n|colspan=\"4\" bgcolor=\"666666\"|\n|-\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\"|5\n|bgcolor=\"pink\"|Tesa Novliana\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|bgcolor=\"FFFF99\" align=\"center\"|Btm 3\n|bgcolor=\"FFFF99\" align=\"center\"|Btm 3\n|\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"yellow\"|'''Out'''\n|colspan=\"4\" bgcolor=\"666666\"|\n|-\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\"|6\n|bgcolor=\"cyan\"|Windra E.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"yellow\"|'''Out'''\n|colspan=\"5\" bgcolor=\"666666\"|\n|-\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\"|7\n|bgcolor=\"cyan\"|Rio Basir\n|\n|bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\" align=\"center\"|Btm 4\n|\n|\n|\n|bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\" align=\"center\"|Btm 3\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"yellow\"|'''Out'''\n|colspan=\"6\" bgcolor=\"666666\"|\n|-\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\"|8\n|bgcolor=\"pink\"|Keyko Vredhe\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"yellow\"|'''Out'''\n|colspan=\"6\" bgcolor=\"666666\"|\n|-\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\"|9\n|bgcolor=\"pink\"|Diana Tumewa\n|\n|\n|\n|bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\" align=\"center\"|Btm 3\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"yellow\"|'''Out'''\n|colspan=\"7\" bgcolor=\"666666\"|\n|-\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\"|10\n|bgcolor=\"cyan\"|Fendi\n|\n|\n|bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\" align=\"center\"|Btm 3\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"yellow\"|'''Out'''\n|colspan=\"8\" bgcolor=\"666666\"|\n|-\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\"|11\n|bgcolor=\"pink\"|Dea Larasati\n|bgcolor=\"FFFF99\" align=\"center\"|Btm 3\n|bgcolor=\"FFFF99\" align=\"center\"|Btm 4\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"yellow\"|'''Out'''\n|colspan=\"9\" bgcolor=\"666666\"|\n|-\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\" rowspan=\"2\"|12-13\n|bgcolor=\"pink\"|Mona Lengkong\n|\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"yellow\" rowspan=\"2\"|'''Out'''\n|rowspan=\"2\"  colspan=\"10\" bgcolor=\"666666\"|\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"pink\"|Ica Intifada\n|bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\" align=\"center\"|Btm 3\n|-\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\"| 14\n|bgcolor=\"cyan\"|Andi Subagja\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"yellow\"|'''Out'''\n|colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"666666\"|\n|-\n|}\n<\/center>\n\n<sup>1<\/sup> On 2nd Spectacular Show, 2 contestants must voted off\n\n<sup>2<\/sup> Starting from Top 10, the judgess is might to use '''Veto Rights''' which the judges could rescue the voted off contestants.

In 2012, RCTI appointed Fabian Dharmawan to be the Executive Producer and a project leader for Indonesian Idol 2012, while Fremantle Media appointed Glenn Sims to lead the new creative direction and tone for the series.  Both Dharmawan and Sims worked closely to free the show of heavy-handed gimmicks that had bogged down previous seasons and to dramatically lift production values.  As a result, Season 7 went on the become the most successful season in the history of Indonesian Idol.\n\nDaniel Mananta who have previously hosted the show will once again be back as the faces of the show.\n\nCompare to previous 6 seasons, Indonesian Idol 2012 was the highest rating and share in average.\n\nDaniel Mananta who have previously hosted the show will once again be back as the faces of the show.\n\nThe judges for this season would be Anang Hermansyah, [[Agnes Monica]], and [[Ahmad Dhani]].\n\n====Elimination chart====\n<center>\n{| border=\"2\" style=\"border:1px solid gray; border-collapse:collapse;\"\n| style=\"background:#FFFF00; padding-left: 1em;\" width=\"20%\" | Safe first\n| style=\"background:#FFFF99; padding-left: 1em;\" width=\"20%\" | Safe second\n| bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\" style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" width=\"20%\" | Eliminated\n| style=\"background:gold;\" width=\"20%\"| <center>Judges' Save<\/center>\n|}\n<\/center>\n<center>\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|colspan=\"2\" align=\"right\"|''Stage:''\n|colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\" align=\"Center\"|'''Spectacular Show'''\n|bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\" align=\"Center\"|'''Finale'''\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" align=\"right\"|''Week:''\n!4\/13\n!4\/20\n!4\/27\n!5\/4\n!5\/11\n!5\/18\n!5\/25\n!6\/1\n!6\/9\n!6\/16\n!6\/23\n!7\/7\n|-\n!Place\n!Contestant\n!colspan=\"12\" align=\"center\"|Result\n|-\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\"|'''1'''\n|bgcolor=\"pink\"|Regina Ivanova\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"lime\"|'''Winner'''\n|-\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\"|'''2'''\n|bgcolor=\"pink\"|Kamasean Matthews\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|bgcolor=\"gold\" align=\"center\"|Safe\n|\n|\n|\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\"|'''Runner Up'''\n|-\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\"|'''3'''\n|bgcolor=\"cyan\"|Prattyoda\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|bgcolor=\"FFFF00\" align=\"center\"|{{nowrap|Btm 2}}\n|\n|bgcolor=\"FFFF00\" align=\"center\"|{{nowrap|Btm 2}}\n|\n|bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\" align=\"center\"|{{nowrap|'''Elim'''}}\n|colspan=\"1\" bgcolor=\"666666\"|\n|-\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\"|'''4'''\n|bgcolor=\"cyan\"|Dionisius Agung\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|bgcolor=\"FFFF00\" align=\"center\"|{{nowrap|Btm 3}}\n|\n|\n|\n|bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\" align=\"center\"|{{nowrap|'''Elim'''}}\n|colspan=\"2\" bgcolor=\"666666\"|\n|-\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\"| '''5'''\n|bgcolor=\"cyan\"|Febri Yoga\n|\n|\n|\n|bgcolor=\"FFFF00\" align=\"center\"|{{nowrap|Btm 3}}\n|\n|bgcolor=\"FFFF99\" align=\"center\"|{{nowrap|Btm 3}}\n|\n|bgcolor=\"FFFF00\" align=\"center\"|{{nowrap|Btm 2}}\n|bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\" align=\"center\"|{{nowrap|'''Elim'''}}\n|colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"666666\"|\n|-\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\"|'''6'''\n|bgcolor=\"pink\"|Maria Rosalia\n|bgcolor=\"FFFF00\" align=\"center\"|{{nowrap|Btm 3}}\n|\n|bgcolor=\"FFFF99\" align=\"center\"|{{nowrap|Btm 3}}\n|\n|bgcolor=\"FFFF00\" align=\"center\"|{{nowrap|Btm 3}}\n|\n|bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\" align=\"center\"|{{nowrap|'''Elim'''}}\n|colspan=\"5\" bgcolor=\"666666\"|\n|-\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\"|'''7'''\n|bgcolor=\"pink\"|Non Dhera Anggia\n|\n|\n|\n|bgcolor=\"FFFF99\" align=\"center\"|{{nowrap|Btm 3}}\n|bgcolor=\"FFFF99\" align=\"center\"|{{nowrap|Btm 3}}\n|bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\" align=\"center\"|{{nowrap|'''Elim'''}}\n|colspan=\"6\" bgcolor=\"666666\"|\n|-\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\"|'''8'''\n|bgcolor=\"cyan\"|Rosandy Nugroho\n|bgcolor=\"FFFF99\" align=\"center\"|{{nowrap|Btm 3}}\n|\n|bgcolor=\"FFFF00\" align=\"center\"|{{nowrap|Btm 3}}\n|\n|bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\" align=\"center\"|{{nowrap|'''Elim'''}}\n|colspan=\"7\" bgcolor=\"666666\"|\n|-\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\"|'''9'''\n|bgcolor=\"cyan\"|Rio Agung Pangestu\n|\n|bgcolor=\"FFFF99\" align=\"center\"|{{nowrap|Btm 3}}\n|\n|bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\" align=\"center\"|{{nowrap|'''Elim'''}}\n|colspan=\"8\" bgcolor=\"666666\"|\n|-\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\"|'''10'''\n|bgcolor=\"cyan\"|Ivan Saputra\n|\n|bgcolor=\"FFFF00\" align=\"center\"|{{nowrap|Btm 3}}\n|bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\" align=\"center\"|{{nowrap|'''Elim'''}}\n|colspan=\"9\" bgcolor=\"666666\"|\n|-\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\"|'''11'''\n|bgcolor=\"pink\"|Belinda Fueza\n|\n|bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\" align=\"center\"|{{nowrap|'''Elim'''}}\n|colspan=\"10\" bgcolor=\"666666\"|\n|-\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\"|'''12'''\n|bgcolor=\"pink\"|Khanza Dinar\n|bgcolor=\"palegoldenrod\" align=\"center\"|{{nowrap|'''Elim'''}}\n|colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"666666\"|\n|-\n|}\n<\/center>\n\n===Season 8===\n{{Main|Indonesian Idol (season 8)}}\n\nThe eighth season of Indonesian Idol returns in 2014. This season will double as the 10th anniversary of Indonesian Idol. The judges for this season would be Anang Hermansyah, [[Ahmad Dhani]], [[Titi DJ]] and Tantri Syalindri. After a great success in producing X Factor Indonesia, Fabian Dharmawan appointed for the second time as the Executive Producer to lead this series. A little but noticeable different in picture quality in this series. Most of the outdoor scenes were shot in HD and most of the establishments were shot using mechanical heli cameras. Still using the same but slightly improved formula in producing, Fabian invests heavily in the judges chemistry and the raw talents of the contestants.\n\n==Indonesian Idol Extra==\nA supplementary program that features news and updates about the Indonesian Idol contestants, highlights from the show, as well as exclusive behind-the-scenes coverage of Indonesian Idol.

This included a six-year contract with Sony BMG and several appearance commitments including singing at local malls. Joy found this offensive to the Idol title. All traces of her Idol journey were removed from the official site.\n* During the Workshop Round of Season 4 and Season 5, many contestants said ''\"Saya sudah berusaha..\"'' (''\"At least I have tried...\"'') or  ''\"Apabila saya diberi kesempatan untuk minggu depan, saya akan ...\"'' (''\"If people give me the chance to stay here for another week, I will...\"'') when they received negative feedbacks from the panels. This stirred up some rumors among fans that it might have been scripted.\n\n== Awards and Nominations ==\nAt the [[2011 Panasonic Gobel Awards]], ''Indonesian Idol'' lost rival shows ''[[Indonesia Mencari Bakat]]'' to take the award Talent Show.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of awards and nominations\n!

The [[Poor Law (Scotland) Act 1845]] modernized the system, and the [[Lands Valuation (Scotland) Act 1854]] established the foundations of the modern system. \n\nThe [[Valuation and Rating (Scotland) Act 1956]] established a system of five-yearly revaluations, undertaken by an Assessor appointed by the local authority. \n\nIn 1989, domestic properties were removed from the rating system with the introduction of the [[Community Charge]] in Scotland, later to be replaced with [[Council Tax]].\n\n== Scope ==\nThe [[Local Government Finance Act 1988]] amended the existing rating system in Scotland from 1990 at the same time as introducing a new system of business rates in [[England and Wales]] from 1990, and the [[Local Government Finance Act 1992]] made further changes.

They are ill-suited for the standard {{convert|20|ft}} and {{convert|40|ft}} [[ISO]] [[intermodal container|shipping containers]] used around the globe.<ref name=MAE130\/>\n\n== Construction and specification==\nAustralian standard pallets are defined by [[Australian Standard]] AS:4068-1993 ''Flat pallets for materials handling''.<ref name=\"SAI\">{{citation|url=http:\/\/infostore.saiglobal.com\/EMEA\/Details.aspx?ProductID=309594|title=AS 4068-1993 Flat pallets for materials handling|accessdate=30 January 2016}}<\/ref>  They are usually manufactured in Hardwood, but 1165 \u00d7 1165&nbsp;mm pallets can also be manufactured using lighter timber suitable for use as disposable pallets using 16 millimetre boards. Australian standard pallets are extensively used in Australian storage and warehousing as [[pallet racking|racking]] pallets because they can be removed from transport directly onto warehouse racking for storage.\n\nThey have a load limit of 2 tonnes.<ref name=\"SAI\" \/>\n\n== Use ==\nThe Australian standard pallet is designed for use with the [[RACE (container)|RACE container]] of Australian railways.  Originally the pallet was specified at 46 \u00d7 46 inches (from a [[Lumber#dimensional lumber|nominal size]] of 48 \u00d7 48 inches, or 4&nbsp;ft \u00d7 4&nbsp;ft),<ref>''The Magazine of Standards'', vol. 20-21, p. 180, American Standards Association, 1949<\/ref> but this has been metricated to the marginally smaller 1165 \u00d7 1165&nbsp;mm dimensions.  Two pallets will fit closely side-by-side in a RACE container.  They can be stacked on two levels and one container can thus hold 20 pallets.  A standard railway wagon carries three containers and can thus hold 60 pallets.<ref>''Bulletin with Newsweek'', vol. 101, p. 76, J. Haynes and J.F. Archibald, 1980<\/ref>\n\nTwo-thirds of palletized transport within Australia uses the 1165 \u00d7 1165 standard pallet.  For external use, where goods are to be shipped in ISO containers, an 1100 \u00d7 1100&nbsp;mm pallet is used.<ref name=MAE130>Metrication, the Australian Experience, p. 130<\/ref>  This is a pallet size widely used by Japan and Korea, but is also specified in the Australian standard for pallets.<ref name=\"SAI\" \/>\n\n== History ==\nAustralia was one of the first countries to develop a standard pallet.  During [[World War II]] the United States, as part of their logistics effort, used palletized transport on a scale never before seen.  This especially impressed the Australians who were still mostly handling goods by manual effort.  When the war ended, the Americans left behind in Australia their materials handling equipment and a very large stock of pallets.  The Australian government formed the [[Commonwealth Handling Equipment Pool]] (CHEP) to exploit these assets, and it was CHEP that introduced the Australian standard pallet.  The government sold the assets of CHEP in the 1950s, mostly to [[port authority|port authorities]], but the trading name of CHEP was taken by [[Brambles Limited]] and is now the largest pallet rental business in the world.<ref>{{multiref|Ackerman, p. 496|LeBlanc}}<\/ref>\n\nDuring the 1970s, Australia converted to the metric system.  Australia pushed ahead with metrication quickly, and did this with less fuss and opposition than occurred in other countries such as the United States or the United Kingdom.  In order to proceed rapidly, a quick decision was needed on pallet sizes before decisions on metrication of packaging could be made.  Because of this, it was decided to retain the Australian standard pallet, despite it being peculiar to Australia.<ref name=MAE130\/>\n\n== International standardisation ==\nNot using an international standard pallet can increase transport costs of international trade.  Export goods may have to be repalletized to suite the requirements of the destination country.  In some cases they must be repalletized twice in the distribution chain, once on to a pallet suitable for international containers and again at the destination country if they are also not using a standard pallet.  Likewise, import goods will not arrive on an Australian standard pallet and need repalletizing for RACE containers.  The intrinsic advantage of palletized transport is that it minimises manual handling operations. These repalletizations detract from that advantage.<ref name=\"Raballand & Aldaz-Carroll, p. 3\">Raballand & Aldaz-Carroll, p. 3<\/ref>\n\nA 2002 report commissioned by the Australian [[Department of Transport and Regional Services]] examined the possibility of replacing the Australian standard pallet with the [[ISO]] standard size of 1200\u00d71000&nbsp;mm.  Two thirds of Australia's trade is with countries that use either this size, or the near equivalent US standard size of 48\u00d740&nbsp;inches so changing to this standard would be less costly than to other standard pallet sizes.<ref>Raballand & Aldaz-Carroll, pp. 4-5<\/ref>  The report concluded that making this change would be worth a [[net present value]] of $2.5 billion at a [[discounting|discount rate]] of 30%, or $5.1 billion at discount rate of 20%.<ref>Sd+D report, p. 15<\/ref>\n\nDespite the analysis in the report, Australia continues to use the Australian standard pallet.<ref name=\"Raballand & Aldaz-Carroll, p. 3\"\/>  The cost of making the change is estimated at $600 million over ten years, which includes not only the change to the pallets themselves, but also to storage racking and other equipment.  Operating costs are estimated to increase by $100 million over the same ten years: the smaller pallet means more handling operations for the same amount of goods, and a less efficient usage of truck and warehouse space (larger pallets have a greater ratio of goods to pallet and packaging).<ref>Sd+D report, pp. 15, 17<\/ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* [http:\/\/catalogue.nla.gov.au\/Record\/2780672 ''Metrication, the Australian Experience: Proceeding of the North American-Australian Metric Conference''], Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne, April 1975\n* ''Review of Domestic and International Pallet Standards and Ongoing Operational and Cost Implications to Australian and International Logistics: Final Report'', Strategic design + Development, 21 March 2002.\n* Ackerman, Kenneth B., ''Practical Handbook of Warehousing'', Springer, 1997 ISBN 0412125110.\n* Leblanc, Rick, [http:\/\/palletenterprise.com\/view_article\/681\/Another-Sneak-Attack,-War-Heralded-Pallet-in-Industry \"Another sneak attack, war heralded pallet in industry\"], ''Pallet Enterprise'', May 2002.\n* Raballand, Ga\u00ebl; Aldaz-Carroll, Enrique, [http:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=665064 ''How Do Differing Standards Increase Trade Costs?

In addition, the policy does not give any numeric value for ''highly cited'' -- which is frustrating. I looked at some well-known scientists, and their ground-breaking articles are cited in the thousands or tens of thousands of times, not the hundreds. [https:\/\/scholar.google.com\/scholar?hl=en&q=george+smoot&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C5&as_sdtp=], [https:\/\/scholar.google.com\/scholar?q=saul+perlmutter&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5]. From my reading, it looks like this person is primarily known for having developed a markup language, but he did that with a group of scholars at Stanford, so it's hard to know what his contribution was. One of his co-authors on that project has documents that have been cited more than 4K times, and journal articles cited in the high three digits, as a comparison.[https:\/\/scholar.google.com\/scholar?q=debora+l+mcguinness&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5].

[[User:LaMona|LaMona]] ([[User talk:LaMona|talk]]) 19:36, 10 July 2015 (UTC)\n*'''Weak keep'''. [[User:LaMona]] seems to be reading [[Wikipedia:Notability_(academics)#Citation_metrics]] in a sense pretty much contrary to what I read it as saying. It fairly clearly accepts citation metrics as an admittedly somewhat imperfect method of establishing notability through measuring academic impact and is mainly concerned with allowing for these imperfections - for instance, taking account of differing expected citation rates in different subjects and, where these rates are low, supplementing or replacing them by other methods of measuring impact. What seems to be the general consensus does ''not'' expect citation rates to be at the astronomical levels that [[User:LaMona]] cites, but rather at the kind of level where a beginning postgraduate in a related subject at an institution without direct connections with the academic concerned might be expected to come across mentions of them. In this case, I note that the subject of the article actually seems to have slightly higher citation rates than any of the most recent [[Fields Medal]]lists - and, while I would expect slightly higher citation rates in computer science than in mathematics, I am still inclined to agree with [[User:David Eppstein]] that the subject's rates are still at least adequate for notability. Having said that, I do share [[User:LaMona]]'s concerns about [[WP:COI]] - the article as it stands is somewhat over-promotional and, together with the creator's username, this does suggest the possibility of [[WP:AUTOBIO]]. If the article is kept, we do not need every detail of his qualifications, career and relatives.

It\u00b4s a bit complicated to explain, when he lived where during this time: When divorcing, his natural parents agreed that he should live with his mother - what\u00b4s normal in such cases - until she would marry again. (Of course, Magda didn\u00b4t think of re-marriage at that time, so she agreed.) When meeting Goebbels and falling in love with him, she tried to cancel that agreement, but was successful only three years after marrying him, in 1934 after the Nazis took power. Since then, Harald again stayed with her at the Goebbels household until 1940, when he finished school and joined the army.\n\nWith best regards, \nEva\n\n\n\n== ARD programme October 2007 ==\n\nDon\u00b4t mistake me, the information about the ARD feature is quite necessary and interesting, but\nshouldn\u00b4t this part be removed from this article and better been mentioned with G\u00fcnther or Herbert Quandt? I suppose the film ARD made deals with the actions of his father and half-brother during the war, so it should be mentioned more likely with one of them. It\u00b4s nothing Harald himself was engaged in, because he was at war in this years.- It might be interesting, by the way, that these film was shown at ARD only after 11:00 pm, when only few people were watching TV. The reason for this is quite clear: Quandt family is the owner of the German car producer BMW - of cause nobody in the German media can be interested to annoy them!!!\n\nMany regards, Eva  <small>\u2014Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions\/87.79.1.52|87.79.1.52]] ([[User talk:87.79.1.52|talk]]) 02:59, 25 January 2008 (UTC)<\/small><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\n\n\n== Cities of studies ==\n \nI\u00b4ve just added an explanation for his chosen cities to study - he went to Hannover and Stuttgart at all, because he could easily earn some money during the vacations there.

She returned to the [[recording studio|studio]] in 1935, and over the next six years recorded over 100 tracks for [[Decca Records]], usually accompanied by the [[pianist]] Richard M.

Tracks included \"I'll Keep Sitting on It,\" \"Take Me for a Buggy Ride,\" \"Mama Knows What Papa Wants When Papa's Feeling Blue,\" and \"Hot Nuts.\"  Her best-known song was \"You Done Lost Your Good Thing Now\" (1935).<ref name=\"russell\"\/>\n\nWhite formed an all-women band in the 1940s, and also performed with [[Bumble Bee Slim]].  She joined [[Big Bill Broonzy]]'s Laughing Trio in 1949 as pianist. \"She was very easy to get along with,\" said Broonzy. \"Real friendly.\"<ref name=\"russell\"\/> She was a club singer in the 1950s, finally  performing in 1959 in Chicago.  She then resumed performing weekends at the Blue Pub, a bar on Irving Park Road near the Kennedy Expressway, where she quickly won a loyal following.  She arrived and left by cab, always dressed as a star.  She sang many of her famous songs but the one she loved the most and did brilliantly was \"Maybe I'm Wrong Again,\" a ballad from an early Bing Crosby movie.  Crosby had recorded it and one or two British bands.  I know because I arrived in Chicago in September, 1964, from St. Louis and one of my new friends took me to the Blue Pub particularly to hear Georgia as I was in the music business (also a journalist and about to become a teacher).  I was immediately caught up in her music and style and we talked a lot.  I could never find \"Maybe I'm Wrong Again,\" a record or sheet music or anything but I made a record of it using only the lyrics I knew from Georgia's performances. Around 2001 I finally found a British C.D. with Bing's recording and was surprised to find I had gotten the melody and the lyrics exactly right.\n\nOne of her songs, \"Alley Boogie\" (recorded November 9, 1937),<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Blues Women |year=1996 |publisher=[[Orbis Publishing]] |id=BLU NC 073 }}<\/ref> was used as the [[theme music]] for the British romantic comedy drama series, ''[[Love Soup]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.phill.co.uk\/comedy\/lovesoup\/ |title=Love Soup (Summary) |publisher=Phill.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-02-16}}<\/ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http:\/\/www.tv.com\/shows\/love-soup\/ |title=Love Soup |publisher=TV.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-16}}<\/ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of classic female blues singers]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:White, Georgia}}\n[[Category:1903 births]]\n[[Category:American blues singers]]\n[[Category:Classic female blues singers]]\n[[Category:Year of death unknown]]\n[[Category:Place of birth unknown]]\n[[Category:Singers from Chicago, Illinois]]","timestamp":"20160410103436","user-timestamp":"20150410103436"},{"title":"Category talk:Musical groups from Drammen","content":"{{WikiProject Norway}}\n{{WikiProject Organizations}}","timestamp":"20160410103436","user-timestamp":"20150410103436"},{"title":"User talk:71.124.235.208","content":"\n\n== August 2012 ==\n[[Image:Information.svg|left|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia.

The problem apparently is that I'm a completely unapologetic idealist. I would rather lose my bit for making decisions that are in the spirit of Wikipedia but against its rules than follow the rules when they fly directly in the face of the spirit of Wikipedia. The biggest quality that I look for in an administrator is integrity. When I was faced with the choice of surrendering the mop or my own integrity, I chose to surrender the mop. It wasn't a hard decision, really. \n\nWho am I? I'm one of the resident patsies of Wikipedia. I spend the majority of my time working with the Counter-Vandalism Unit. Every single day, Wikipedia is deluged by thousands of vandalism hits. The only thing that prevents the projects from deteriorating into an unusable mess is the group of people that fight every moment of every day to prevent that from happening. What do I do? I clean up all the graffiti off the walls so that the legitimate writers can do their work in peace without having to deal with it. '''I think it's important to note that I tend to get more recognition for removing \"Fuck you\" from an article than most content contributors get for promoting an article to FA status. To that end, be sure to thank a content contributor today.''' \n\nThe most worthwhile Wikipedians are the ones that gain the least recognition and desire the least. These are the ones who really make Wikipedia what it is. \n\nFor all the barnstars and other random crap I have picked up over the years, look [[User:Trusilver\/Awards|here.]]\n\n[[User:Trusilver\/Recall|This editor is subject to recall under certain conditions.]] (Not to be de-sysopped, but rather to take up the mop again)\n\nWhat I've done:\n* {{Admin|Trusilver}}\n* {{usercheck|Trusilver}}\n\n'''Wikiphilosophy:'''\n\n'''Concerning [[WP:RFU|Requests for Unblock]]:''' I don't have a lot of tolerance for unblock requests that sit for days or weeks because nobody can muster up the balls to make a decision. There are remarkably few administrators that are willing to make tough decisions; it's far easier to pass on something and let someone else handle it than to make a difficult decision yourself. The problem is when EVERY administrator just sits on their collective asses waiting for someone else to do something. Wikipedia is run by volunteers, even someone who has been blocked. As such, any serious unblock request deserves respect, and should be acted on with respect. The breakdown in the system occurs when you have a dozen administrators, including the blocking admin, gathered around (pardon the imagery) with their thumbs up their asses because nobody wants to be the one to step forward and say \"Sure, I'll do it... here's my conditions.\"\n\n'''Concerning deletionism\/inclusionism:''' I refuse to attach a label to myself. I think that it is a foolish endeavor that divides us more than it identifies us. I find each extreme to be just as damaging as the other. However, I find that the integrity of the encyclopedia demands that there be more of a criteria for inclusion than just [[WP:V]]. We have guidelines for notability that have been agreed on by consensus and as such I have very little use for the kind of editor that feels that those guidelines don't apply to them or the articles that they have chosen to defend in AfD. Put fifteen Wikipedians in a room together and you will get sixteen distinct opinions on what is \"encyclopedic\", but that is what we have guidelines for. \n\n'''Concerning RfA:''' \"Democracy is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried.\" So said Churchhill, and I feel the same way about the RfA process. The process is ridiculous and cumbersome, not to mention a playground for all of the grudges and pissing matches that are more suited to the schoolyard. So sayeth Jimbo: adminship is [[WP:BIGDEAL|\"no big deal\"]]. I don't treat it as such. My criteria for RfA is summarized [[User:Trusilver\/RFA|'''here.''']]\n\n'''Concerning Edit count, and all the little stupid things we worry too much about:''' I have a huge edit count. Big deal. I have a huge edit count because I spend all of my time reverting vandalism, and doing all of the little background tasks that allow people like [[User:Deacon of Pndapetzim|this guy,]] or [[User:Tarif Ezaz|this guy,]] or even [[User talk:93.96.148.42|this guy,]] to not have to worry about such things while they are working on the encyclopedia. I consider myself a cog in the machine. Not a bigger or more important cog than any of the others, just one among many. Another thousand edits won't change that, another ten thousand won't change that. \n\nMy edits are not always perfect but are always made with the best intentions. If I made a mistake somewhere then I apologize and am happy to discuss it with you. If I copyedited your article and chopped it all to hell, I only ask that you take some time and consider the changes before you get upset about it. Likewise, when I patrol the recent changes I occasionally revert something as vandalism when it turns out not to be. I am only human and when I'm reverting a hundred incidents of vandalism a day, I occasionally make a change that was not warranted.\n\n'''That which must never be forgotten''' (a.k.a. a collection of essays that express the greatest truths that can be offered on the project.

Myers of the U.S. Air Force wears the Desert Camouflage Uniform during a December 2001 visit to the {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71}}.]]\nThe '''Desert Camouflage Uniform''' ('''DCU''') is an American arid-environment camouflage uniform used by the [[United States Armed Forces]]. In terms of pattern and cut, it is nearly identical to the U.S. military's [[Battle Dress Uniform]] (BDU) uniform, but features a three-color desert camouflage pattern of dark brown, pale green, and beige, as opposed to the beige, pale green, two tones of brown, and black and white rock spots of the previous [[Desert Battle Dress Uniform]] (DBDU).\n\n==History==\nFirst issued in very limited quantity in 1990 as experimental test patterns, the DCU and its camouflage scheme, officially known as the Desert Camouflage Pattern, and also known as \"coffee stain camouflage\", was developed to replace the six-color desert camouflage \"chocolate-chip camouflage\" uniform, which was deemed unsuitable for most desert combat theaters. As opposed to the original six-color DBDU, which was meant for a rockier and elevated desert battlefield that was often not encountered, the DCU was created primarily for a lower, more open, and less rocky desert battlefield space which became a common sight throughout the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]]. As a replacement pattern, this meant a new arid region had to be utilized to test the effectiveness of the DCU. Desert soil samples from parts of the Middle East, namely Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait, were used as testing locations to find the appropriate color palettes. All American personnel in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Iraq wore the DBDU during the entire Gulf War campaign, with the exception of some select U.S. Army generals who were issued the DCU a month following the air campaign in Desert Storm. Norman Schwarzkopf, then CENTCOM commander, and leader of American forces during Desert Storm, was issued an M-65 field jacket as well as coat and trousers in the new DCU color pattern shortly before the war ended.\n\nBy 1992, the first wide scale batches of DCU's were issued first by the [[United States Army]], and within a year to the [[United States Air Force]], and replaced the majority of the DBDU by 1993, with the [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] replacing their older six-colored desert fatigues from 1993 through 1995.\n\n===U.S. Army===\n[[Image:ACU-BDU-WWII uniform.jpg|thumb|upright|right|U.S. Army soldiers in May 2005 wearing the [[Army Combat Uniform]], Desert Camouflage Uniform and a World War II-era uniform (left to right).]]\nFielded in 1991, the DCU served as the U.S. Army's primary desert combat pattern from 1992 to 2004. In June 2004, the Army introduced a new digital style pattern called UCP ([[Universal Camouflage Pattern]]). In 2005, the DCU and the BDU was discontinued within the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], being replaced with the [[Army Combat Uniform]] (ACU) by 2008.\n\n===U.S. Marine Corps===\nFollowing the Army, the United States Marine Corps began issuing the DCU from 1993 through 1995 and remained the Marine Corps standard arid combat uniform from 1993 to 2002. In January 2002, the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] became the first branch to replace both its BDUs and DCUs with the [[Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform]] (MCCUU), completely replacing them in October 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.usmc.mil\/maradmins\/maradmin2000.nsf\/0872a7ac9a4c08a6852569b9000bc3f1\/54d1925fde54478885256f170027f0b0?OpenDocument |author=Commandant of the United States Marine Corps |publisher=United States Department of the Navy |work=United States Marine Corps |date=September 22, 2004 |title=MARADMIN 412\/04: MANDATORY POSSESSION DATES FOR THE MARINE CORPS COMBAT UTILITY UNIFORMS (MCCUU) AND MARINE CORPS COMBAT BOOTS (MCCB) |accessdate=September 29, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20040929112751\/http:\/\/www.usmc.mil\/maradmins\/maradmin2000.nsf\/0872a7ac9a4c08a6852569b9000bc3f1\/54d1925fde54478885256f170027f0b0?OpenDocument |archivedate=September 29, 2004 }}<\/ref>\n\n===U.S. Air Force===\nAlong with the Army, the Air Force began issuing the DCU in 1992 and remained its primary desert uniform until 2011.

My experience in episode lists demonstrates that some Wikipedians may have something to say about it though.  In several talk pages about episode lists I've seen comments about articles for each episode of any given show as being \"excessive\" or \"unnecessary\".  Don't be surprised if you take some heat from them.  Good luck.  [[User:Redux|Redux]] 21:25, 9 Jun 2004 (UTC)\n\n::Since you are going to do this, I would suggest that you throw in an episode-by-episode list of the guest stars.  We already have an [[List of guest stars on Friends|article]] about that, but it's just a simple list and there's no way to tell when or in which episode each one was there.  Just a thought.   [[User:Redux|Redux]] 21:39, 9 Jun 2004 (UTC)\n\n:::I've started adding 'as ....' and a brief synopsis of the guest's involvement on [[List of guest stars on Friends]].

I have already looked online and although there are definitely plenty of episode guides out there, they are all canned and not very detailed.  I am hoping that with the wiki format I can create a more relationship-based guide whereby connections between characters, plot consistency, etc. can be explored.  My strongest argument being that [[Star Trek]] obviously has in depth coverage all over the 'net, but I think the wiki [[List of Star Trek TNG episodes]] does a great job.  Thanks for the support and suggestion!\n\n== New Design ==\n\nI think it is time that the episode list is formatted using the template like other episode lists.

It is {{Tld|Episode navigators}}<code><nowiki>{{Episode navigation|parent=[[List of Friends episodes|List of ''Friends'' episodes]]|prev={{{1}}}|next={{{2}}} }}<\/nowiki><\/code>. Just type <nowiki> {{Friends navigation|[[preceeding episode|[[following episode]]}} <\/nowiki> (with pipes in between each piece). I'm working on adding it to articles, and fixing the category sorting. I also noticed that the list isn't uniform. We should probably work on that too. I'll do some if I have the time. [[User:Lachatdelarue|Lachatdelarue]] [[User_talk:Lachatdelarue|(talk)]] 19:23, 16 July 2005 (UTC)\n\n== Standardization ==\n\nPeople, I realize it's a lot of [boring] work, but either we have all the season listings with boards or we have plain lists for them all (as it was before).  But it really doesn't sit well to have half of the listings as boards and the other half as plain lists.  More importantly, it seems that the effort to convert the simple lists into boards has come to a stop.  The boards are not a bad idea, but nor are they essential to an article that is meant to be a simple list of episodes (as the article is structured right now, more details, such as plot summaries, should be located in each episode's article).  If there's no intention of completing this conversion task, I'd favor reverting the whole thing back to it's original appearance &mdash; remember that nothing is completely lost in Wikipedia, so if ever someone decides to complete the change, they can just bring back the boards that had already been done and take it from there.

Per that policy, it is clear that the majority of the individual Friends episode articles should be redirected to this list page where brief plot synopses can be provided; alternatively, the articles should be rewritten to address the notability issues laid out at the guideline. It should be quickly noted that plot summaries, goofs, and trivia are explicitly cited as unencyclopedic and insufficient content for individual episode articles. Over the 3 years that these articles have existed, few aspire to much more than that.

[[User:Brad|Brad]] 18:47, 24 July 2007 (UTC)\n:I don't dispute the rationale. However as the article is 100 kilobytes there is already a valid argument for this article to be divided into seasons, based on [[Article_length#A_rule_of_thumb|this]]. Thus merging the two sections could ironically result in the creation of eight additional articles for the content of these two articles. My advice would therefore be not to merge, although I have no objection to either course of action. [[User:BeL1EveR|BeL1EveR]] 22:29, 29 July 2007 (UTC)\n::Hmm. It looks like that's already begun.

See [[WP:TV-REVIEW]] and [[WP:EPISODE]] for more info.\n\nPer [[WP:EPISODE]], not every episode of a TV show should likely have an individual article.

Approxiamately 90% of the episodes lack any kind of sources. I don't think there are many sources available for the majority of these episodes, however there definitely could be for a few of them; therefore remove redundant content to the LOE page and consider making a season 1 page.

They are not a copy of this article exclusively though, since a paragraph-long synopsis was added to the specific articles, but that alone doesn't seem to indicate that a separate article for each season should exist.

Later on, if there's an actual need for there to be separate articles &mdash; meaning, if there is enough information specific to each season that a breakaway from the main article is justifiable &mdash; we can separate them again.  But I would not recommend keeping the current naming that was used (\"Season X (Friends)\"), since it seems to me that this is not the ideal naming for this type of article &mdash; something like \"Friends (season 1)\", as it is done with the ''American Idol'' season-specific articles, would be more appropriate.

Other episode articles have either met those requirements, or they simply have not been cleaned up and properly merged back to their episode lists. Wikipedia is not a television series guide for providing extensive, lengthy plot summaries of episodes. An episode should only get an article if it can establish real world notability through significant coverage in third-party sources (not including listings in TV guide, et al). The Friends episodes couldn't do that and were properly merged by consensus. Also, in the future, when someone asks you stop your wikifying, stop it already.

Sales rank of one volume of the hardbound edition is 91,661. (Amazon sales rank of ''Think and Grow Rich'' is 391!!!!) So, the book itself is borderline; if someone deeply familiar with it actually wanted to do a good whole article on it, that would be OK, but it's not anything we actually need.  \n\nActually the book described in the article '''not''' seem to match perfectly with descriptions of the Napoleon Hill book, as it says there are ''forty'' chapters altogether, and the Amazon reference is entitled \"The Law of Success In ''Sixteen'' Lessons,\" while as everybody knows (i.e. it's in another book title and is mentioned in our article on [[Think and Grow Rich]]) Hill had ''seventeen'' principles of success.\n\nJudging by past history, I think it is very, very unlikely that the original author or anyone else is going to do much with it.

Often cited as the first Phish \"album\", ''The White Tape'' was originally a collection of original material that the band used as a demo\/sample tape for venues, and was sometimes labelled \"Phish\" or simply \"Demo\".<ref>[http:\/\/phish.net\/discography\/the-white-tape The White Tape History] Phish.net. Online. Accessed: September 14, 2011.<\/ref> The album was widely circulated among Phish fans for more than a decade before being officially released in 1998.\n\nThe album was created from four-track recordings over a period of three years and includes a number of outside musicians performing on various songs. Only \"Alumni Blues\", \"AC\/DC Bag\", \"Slave To The Traffic Light\" and \"Dog Gone Dog\" (a.k.a. \"Dog Log\") have the four band members together. The remaining tracks were recorded separately by various members and blended together to create the finished album.<ref>[http:\/\/phish.com\/#\/music\/the-white-tape Phish's The White Tape] Phish.com. Online. Accessed: September 14, 2011.<\/ref>\n\n''The White Tape'' includes an early version of the Phish epic \"[[You Enjoy Myself]]\", performed ''[[a cappella]]'' with the band members singing the opening guitar lines. The album also contains [[avant-garde]] [[experimental rock|experimental]] pieces, instrumental passages, electronic noises and studio [[Audio engineering|trickery]]. Some songs were further developed and figure heavily in the band's live performances, while a few have rarely been heard since.\n\nAll instruments and vocals on \"Fuck Your Face\", \"NO<sub>2<\/sub>\", \"He Ent to the Bog\" and \"Minkin\" are performed solely by bass guitarist [[Mike Gordon]]. All instruments and vocals on \"Run Like an Antelope\" and \"And So to Bed\" are recorded solely by [[Trey Anastasio]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\n\"The Divided Sky\", \"Ingest\" and \"Fluff's Travels\" are performed by Anastasio, Phish lyricist [[Tom Marshall (singer)|Tom Marshall]], and their friend [[Marc Daubert]] on percussion. \"Aftermath\" has Anastasio and Roger Holloway on guitar. \"Slave to the Traffic Light\" has [[Tom Marshall (singer)|Tom Marshall]] on keyboards and Pete Cottone on drums.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nIn addition to being released on [[Compact Disc|CD]], this album was made available on June 7, 2006, as a download in [[Free Lossless Audio Codec|FLAC]] and [[MP3]] formats at LivePhish.com.\n\nA limited edition white vinyl version was released at Superball IX, Phish's 2011 summer festival with the remainder offered up for sale as part of [[Record Store Day]]'s \"Black Friday\" promotion on November 25, 2011.\n\n==Track listing==\nAll tracks written by [[Trey Anastasio]] unless otherwise noted.\n\n'''Side 1'''\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed=no\n| total_length=\n| writing_credits=yes\n\n| title1=Alumni Blues\n| length1=4:11\n\n| title2=And So to Bed\n| length2=4:44\n\n| title3=You Enjoy Myself\n| length3=0:55\n\n| title4=AC\/DC Bag\n| length4=4:09\n\n| title5=Fuck Your Face\n| writer5=[[Mike Gordon]]\n| length5=2:16\n\n| title6=The Divided Sky\n| length6=1:17\n\n| title7=Slave to the Traffic Light\n| writer7=Anastasio, Dave Abrahams, [[The Dude of Life|Steve Pollak]]\n| length7=4:35\n\n| title8=Aftermath\n| writer8=Trey Anastasio, Roger Holloway\n| length8=2:55\n\n| title9=Ingest\n| length9=1:38\n}}\n\n'''Side 2'''\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed=no\n| total_length=54:27\n| writing_credits=yes\n\n| title1=NO2\n| writer1=Gordon\n| length1=7:38\n\n| title2=Fluff's Travels\n| length2=1:22\n\n| title3=Dog Gone Dog\n| length3=4:03\n\n| title4=He Ent to the Bog\n| writer4=Gordon, Christian McBride\n| length4=3:56\n\n| title5=Run Like an Antelope\n| writer5=Anastasio, [[Tom Marshall (singer)|Tom Marshall]]\n| length5=6:41\n\n| title6=Minkin\n| writer6=Gordon\n| length6=3:00\n\n| title7=Letter to Jimmy Page\n| length7=1:17\n}}\n\n==Personnel==\n:[[Trey Anastasio]] - guitars, vocals\n:[[Page McConnell]] - keyboards, vocals\n:[[Mike Gordon]] - bass guitar, vocals\n:[[Jon Fishman]] - drums, vocals\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http:\/\/phish.com\/ Phish.com - Official Site]\n* [http:\/\/phish.com\/#\/music\/the-white-tape Phish.com: The White Tape]\n* [http:\/\/phish.net\/discography\/the-white-tape Phish.net: The White Tape] - Includes details on cassette versions.\n* [http:\/\/phish.com\/#\/news\/2011\/16\/the-white-tape-and-party-time-vinyl-released-on-black-friday Vinyl White Tape - Record Store Day]\n\n{{Phish}}\n\n[[Category:1986 debut albums]]\n[[Category:Phish albums]]\n[[Category:LivePhish.com Downloads]]","timestamp":"20160410103451","user-timestamp":"20150410103451"},{"title":"Benthophilus pinchuki","content":"{{Taxobox\n| name = Pinchuk's pugolovka\n| image = \n| status = NE\n| status_system = IUCN3.1\n| status_ref = \n| regnum = [[Animalia]]\n| phylum = [[Chordata]]\n| classis = [[Actinopterygii]]\n| ordo = [[Perciformes]]\n| familia = [[Gobiidae]]\n| subfamilia = [[Benthophilinae]]\n| genus = ''[[Benthophilus]]''\n| species = ''B. pinchuki''\n| binomial = ''Benthophilus pinchuki''\n| binomial_authority = [[Dadash Bahman oglu Ragimov|Ragimov]], 1982\n| synonyms =\n* ''Benthophilus ctenolepidus pinchuki'' <small>Ragimov, 1982<\/small>\n| range_map = Benthophilus pinchuki range.png\n| range_map_caption = The range of the Pinchuk's pugolovka\n}}\n\n'''''Benthophilus pinchuki''''', '''Pinchuk's pugolovka''', is a [[species]] of [[goby|gobiid fish]] found along the eastern and western coasts of the [[Caspian Sea]], but absent on the middle part.<ref>Boldyrev V.S., Bogutskaya N.G.

However the shot still has a wrong white balance (too much red for my liking) and doesn't really compare with our [[:Image:Koala climbing tree.jpg|other]] koala FP. The face and a lot of the body is blocked off by the branch and either way it is not in its natural environment (well less natural, that's just a dead tree branch). --[[User: Antilived|antilived]]<sup>[[User_talk:Antilived|T]] | [[Special:Contributions\/Antilived|C]] | [[User:Antilived\/Gallery|G]]<\/sup> 10:47, 20 July 2007 (UTC)\n** Well, I don't remember exactly where they were in the Zoo, but it was one of the first animals I saw, so somewhere close to the entrance, I guess.  There were no bars, just a relatively small wall that allowed me to take the pic easily.  I have seen that other picture of the koala climbing a tree, but didn't see it was an FP.  In my opinion that one is a bit too greenish and yes, it definitely is \"posing\" for the camera, but the light in the background is a bit disturbing and its face is not really on focus.  But anyway, who am I to judge an already elected FP? ;) On the other hand, I think it doesn't make much sense to choose another koala pic, if one has already been a POTD.

I would argue this isn't posing as the creature did not assume its posture due to your presence so we at wikipedia could get a \"cute\" shot, it just worked out that way. I like the detail in the fur and claws as well, the only thing I can fault with it is the fact the face and head isnt really visible but its asleep so thats less important.

I don't know what the statement \"composition is uninteresting,\" has to do with this picture, Wikipedia has plenty of featured fruit pictures with nothing but the subject and a white background. The color balance on this is also rich. I don't think the Flickr images in the link above are better than this one; but I do think this shot is a higher resolution than the featured, first picture, on the article page (and without the blown highlights). - [[User:DMCer|DMCer]] 03:48, 24 July 2007 (UTC)\n*'''Neutral''' I would love to support but the sheer fact that the koala's face is not visible really does it for me.

One day, he and his friend Tori Meadows spot their other friend, Bronk Stone, get beaten in a duel against Reginald \"Shark\" Kastle who takes his deck as a result. When Yuma stands up to him, Shark breaks the key he got from his parents and kicks half of it away, though he gives him a chance to put his own deck on the line in a duel to win back Bronk's deck. Noticing Yuma looking less ambitious but still willing to fight against Shark, Bronk manages to return the second half of his key to him. The day of the duel between Yuma and Shark comes, and Yuma's amateur duel skills put him at a disadvantage against Shark's deck. As Yuma defends himself against Shark's assault, his key suddenly repairs itself and he finds himself in front of a strange door, which he opens with his key. A mysterious being emerges and tries to merge with Yuma, but this fails and the memories and power of the spirit are divided into 99 Number cards, which then fly off in different directions. Upon returning to the real world, Shark is possessed by a Number card and summons the Xyz monster Number 17: Leviathan Dragon, while Yuma is greeted by the mysterious spirit.\n |LineColor = 0CA7ED\n}}\n{{Japanese episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |RTitle = &nbsp;\/ \"My Name is Astral\"\n |KanjiTitle      = \u308f\u304c\u540d\u306f\u30a2\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30eb!\n |RomajiTitle     = Waga na wa Asutoraru\n |EnglishTitle    = Go With the Flow: Part 2\n |OriginalAirDate = April 18, 2011<ref name=\"WN-April\"\/>\n |FirstEngAirDate = October 22, 2011<ref name=\"CW 2\">{{cite web |archiveurl=http:\/\/www.webcitation.org\/62Rtkapzm |archivedate=October 10, 2011 |url=http:\/\/www2.cw56.com\/schedule\/date\/2011-10-22\/ |title=CW October 22, 2011 schedule |publisher=[[The CW Television Network]] |accessdate=October 10, 2011}}<\/ref>\n |ShortSummary    = The being, known as Astral, speaks to Yuma, who is the only one who can see or hear him, explaining he is a duelist whose memories have been divided into 100 Number cards. Yuma manages to inflict some damage to Shark, but it is then revealed that Number monsters can only be destroyed by battle with another Number monster. Realizing he will disappear if Yuma loses the duel, Astral starts sharing his duel tactics with him, and gives him an Xyz Monster, Number 39: Utopia, which Yuma summons to deal some damage to Shark. Although Shark manages to bring Yuma's life points down to 100, Yuma's determination not to give up allows him to draw a Spell card that allows him to double Utopia's attack points and destroy Leviathan Dragon, winning the duel. After the duel, Astral claims the Number card that possessed Shark, even while his gang deserts him.

Later that day, Yuma's sister, Kari, deduces that the origin of the virus came from somewhere in Yuma's school and asks Yuma and Tori to go on a stakeout. They find Caswell, who inadvertently sets off a virus, and with his help they discover the culprit is their teacher, Mr. Kay, who has been possessed by one of the Numbers. With a virus bomb which will spread throughout the network in 30 minutes, Astral reappears and tells Yuma to battle Kay in a duel.

Kite soon resummons Galaxy-Eyes, whilst Yuma summons out Utopia Ray, but Kite manages to survive his attack by utilizing his own Spell card against him. Kite then brings out Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon, which destroys itself with Utopia. Yuma activates a spell to revive Utopia and Utopia Ray, but Kite manages to use the same spell to revive Galaxy-Eyes and Neo Galaxy-Eyes and win the duel.

Meanwhile, in the Barian World, a group of 4 Barian Emperors plot against Yuma and Astral, as Dumon tells his subodinates that since Yuma and Astral were a lot stronger than they thought, they will now have to intervene directly.    \n |LineColor = 008000\n}}\n|}\n\n===Specials===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:98%; margin:auto; background:#FFF; table-layout:fixed;\"\n|- style=\"border-bottom: 6px solid #003000\"\n! style=\"width:5em;\"  | No.\n!

''[[Hamuns|H\u0101m\u016bn]]'' is generic term which refers to shallow lakes (or lagoons), usually seasonal, that occur in deserts of southeast Iran and adjacent areas of Afghanistan and [[Pakistan]] as product of [[snowmelt]] in nearby mountains in spring. The term H\u0101m\u016bn Lake (or Lake H\u0101m\u016bn) is equally applied to [[Hamun-e Helmand|H\u0101m\u016bn-e Helmand]]<ref name=\"geonames_lake_hamoun\">[http:\/\/www.geonames.org\/maps\/google_31_61.25.html Geonames website]<\/ref> (entirely in Iran), as well to shallow lakes [[H\u0101m\u016bn-e Sabari]] and [[H\u0101m\u016bn-e Puzak]], which extend into territory of present-day Afghanistan with latter being almost entirely inside Afghanistan. The Hamun is fed by numerous seasonal water tributaries; the main tributary is the [[Perennial stream|perennial]] [[Helmand River]], which originates in Afghanistan [[Hindu Kush]] mountains. In modern times, and prior to the existence of the dams for agricultural irrigation, spring floods would bring into existence much larger lakes.\n\nIn Iran term ''Dary\u0101cheh-ye S\u012bst\u0101n'' (\u201c'''Lake S\u012bst\u0101n'''\u201d) is also used, with similar meanings, for lake [[Hamun-e Helmand|H\u0101m\u016bn-e Helmand]].<ref name=\"geonames_lake_hamoun\"\/>\n\n==Geography==\nIt is located in [[Afghanistan]] which forms on the [[Sistan|S\u012bst\u0101n]] marshes west of the [[Dashti Margo|Dasht-e M\u0101rgow]] desert where the [[Helmand River]] forms a [[River delta|dendritic delta]]. Water flows in a circular fashion through a string of lakes starting with [[H\u0101m\u016bn-e Puzak]] in the northeast, sweeping into [[H\u0101m\u016bn-e Sabari]] and finally overflows into [[Hamun-e Helmand|H\u0101m\u016bn-e Helmand]] in the southwest.<ref name=\"weier_2002\">{{harvnb|Weier|2002}}<\/ref><ref name=\"partov_1998\">{{harvnb|Partov|1998}}<\/ref>\n\nIt used to cover an area of about 4,000&nbsp;km<sup>2<\/sup> (1,500&nbsp;mi<sup>2<\/sup>) with dense reed beds and [[Tamarix|tamarisk]] thicket fringing on the edges of the upper lakes. Area was thriving with wildlife animals and migratory birds.<ref name=\"weier_2002\"\/>\n\nA trapezoid shaped [[basalt]] outcropping, known as [[Mount Khajeh]],<ref>[[Mount Khajeh]] is named after an Islamic pilgrimage site on the hill: the tomb and shrine of [[Khwaja Ali Mahdi]], descendant of [[Ali|Al\u012b ibn Ab\u012b \u1e6c\u0101lib]]<\/ref> rises up as an island in the middle of which used to be H\u0101m\u016bn Lake and the northeastern edge of [[Hamun-e Helmand|H\u0101m\u016bn-e Helmand]]. Its flat-topped peak rises up 609 meters above sea level with a diameter 2-2.5&nbsp;km, being the only remaining natural uplift in the [[Sistan|S\u012bst\u0101n]] [[flatlands]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Archeological sites===\nThe area has important archeological remains. The ruins of an ancient [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] city [[Dahan-e Gholaman]] (\u201cGate of Slaves\u201d) are near the H\u0101m\u016bn Lake {{coord|31.508625|N|61.753551|E|}}.\n\nIn 1975 the [[Hamun-e Helmand|H\u0101m\u016bn-e Helmand]], together with [[H\u0101m\u016bn-e Sabari]], was designated a [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar site]].<ref>[http:\/\/ramsar.wetlands.org\/Database\/Searchforsites\/tabid\/765\/language\/en-US\/Default.aspx Ramsar sites database]<\/ref>\n\n===Irrigation===\nIn the past five millennia, people around Hamoun Oasis for the most part lived in harmony with the [[wetland]]s and their wildlife. Specific culture formed around the Hamoun with a way of life suited to the desert wetlands. They fashioned long reed boats to navigate the shallow waters and erected squat, red clay houses to withstand the heat of the desert. Their livelihood was based almost entirely on hunting, fishing, and farming.<br>\nUntil the late 20th century, [[irrigation]] waxed and waned in the [[Sistan Basin|S\u012bst\u0101n Basin]] for over 4,000 years without destroying the wetlands, but then population rapidly increased and new more efficient water management technologies were brought to the region. Soon irrigation schemes began to snake their way throughout the basin. Farther west, revolving Afghan governments constructed large dams (Arghandab Dam, [[Kajaki Dam]]) that diverted water from the upper reaches of the river.<ref name=\"weier_2002\"\/>\n\n===Devastation by extreme droughts in 1999-2001===\nPrecipitation variability in the [[Hindu Kush]] results in alternating periods of flooding in the [[Helmand River|Helmand]] and droughts, which may cause entire lagoons to dry up. This occurred several times in the 20th century, when only the uppermost of the lakes remained flooded.  [[Landsat program|Landsat satellite]] imagery show how dramatic decrease in precipitation resulted in decrease of snow-covered area in the Helmand Basin, from 41,000&nbsp;km<sup>2<\/sup> in 1998 to 26,000&nbsp;km<sup>2<\/sup> in 2000. By 2001, Iran and Afghanistan were experienced for the third consecutive year an extreme drought that was so severe that the Hamoun dried out completely.<ref name=\"partov_1998\"\/>\n\n[[Sistan|S\u012bst\u0101n]]'s population, swelled by refugees from war-torn Afghanistan, has been severely affected by water shortages. Irrigation channels have run dry and agriculture has come to a standstill, which has resulted in the abandonment of many villages as people migrate in search of water.<ref name=\"partov_1998\"\/>\n\nCombination of drought and the massive irrigation proved to be a shock to the [[wetland]]s. Within five years period (1998-2002) once fertile wetlands rapidly deteriorated. We could reasonably presume that transformation of Hamoun into arid country, like their surrounding areas, was mainly caused by irrigated agriculture expansion since the 1970s (represent as bright red patches on satellite images, mainly wheat and barley), coupled with one of the worst droughts ever witnessed in Central Asia in 1999-2001 period.<br>\nThe wetlands have been replaced mostly by lifeless [[Dry lake|salt flats]] and decaying [[Reed bed|reed stands]]. The wildlife, the towns, the fisheries, and the agriculture that once surrounded the Hamoun have all fallen away, giving rise to a wasteland.<ref name=\"weier_2002\"\/>\n\nWinds that were once cooled by the waters of the wetlands now drifting dust, sand, and salt from the dried lakebeds onto the surrounding villages, and these sand drifts have submerged nearly 100 villages beneath dunes in a landscape reminiscent of the [[Aral Sea]] disaster. Most of the crops have been reduced to dustbowl conditions, [[livestock]] herds have been decimated, and thriving fishery with an annual catch of around 12,000 tons has been wiped out. Many who had lived around the Hamoun for generations either moved away or lost everything.\n<br>\nLocal bird population disappeared and migratory birds no longer stop for lack of refuge, and wildlife that could not sustain themselves in the desert or make the long journey to another oasis died.<ref name=\"weier_2002\"\/><ref name=\"partov_1998\"\/>  The rest of the [[wetland]]s now give off the harsh glare of dried [[Dry lake|salt flats]]. The only relatively large bodies of standing water are [[Ch\u0101h-N\u012bmeh IV Dam|Ch\u0101h-N\u012bmeh IV reservoir]] maintained for drinking water.<ref name=\"partov_1998\"\/>\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallery\n|style  =align:center; line-height:135%;\n|title  =\n|width  =240\n|height =300\n|lines  =5\n|File:Hamoun_Oasis_wetlands_1976_satelite.jpg|'''1976''' - thriving Hamoun Oasis <nowiki>[<\/nowiki>[[Landsat 3]]<nowiki>]<\/nowiki><br>[[Helmand River]] creates dendritic delta and dissipates itself in a series of ''hamouns'' along with numerous seasonal rivers which converge into [[Endorheic basin|endorheic]] [[Sistan Basin|S\u012bst\u0101n Basin]].\n|File:Hamoun_Oasis_salt_flatlands_2001_satellite.jpg|'''2001''' - vanished Hamoun Oasis <nowiki>[<\/nowiki>[[Landsat 7]]<br> Vanished during largest persistent drought in South and Central Asia (1999-2001), resulted in creation of large [[Dry lake|salt flatlands]] (white area).\n|Image:AfghanistanHelmandKajakaiDamm.jpg|[[Kajaki Dam]] provides flood control, power and irrigation water to the Helmand Valley.

It is now known as [[Dalton Barracks]] and is used by the [[Royal Logistic Corps]]. \n\n==History==\nThe airfield was opened in 1932, initially as a training station for [[RAF Bomber Command]].\n\n===Second World War===\n[[No. 10 Operational Training Unit RAF]] was based at the airfield throughout the [[World War II|Second World War]] and until 1946. From 1940 to 1942, Abingdon's station commander was [[Herbert Massey]].<ref>[http:\/\/www.rafweb.org\/Biographies\/Massey.htm RAF Web]<\/ref>\n\n===1945\u201360===\nAfter the Second World War RAF Abingdon became part of [[RAF Transport Command]], and also became the home of No. 1 Parachute Training School which is now stationed at [[RAF Brize Norton]]. The Parachute Training School, and RAF Abingdon generally, featured heavily in the 1953 Alan Ladd film ''[[The Red Beret]]'' (called ''Paratrooper'' in the USA), and the Parachute Training School was used as a location for some scenes for the films ''[[Carve Her Name With Pride]]'' (1958) and ''[[Operation Crossbow]]'' (1965) as well as the French comedy ''Babette s'en va-t-en guerre'' (1959) which starred [[Brigitte Bardot]]. On 14 June 1968 Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] conducted a royal review at RAF Abingdon to mark the 50th anniversary of the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]].\n\nAbout 1948\u201349 No. 47 Group Headquarters of RAF Transport Command was at RAF Abingdon. The station, its personnel and aircraft (Yorks and Hastings) were involved in the Berlin Airlift.<ref>personal service records<\/ref> \n\nIn 1952 a ferry unit was based at RAF Abingdon. It moved [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]], [[de Havilland Hornet|Hornet]], [[Gloster Meteor|Meteor]], [[de Havilland Vampire|Vampire]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] aircraft. 15 Sabres were ferried from [[Canada]] but only 12 arrived. After checks and servicing the Sabres went to [[RAF Germany]].\n\nIn 1953 all flying units dispersed to other units to make way for Nos. [[No. 24 Squadron RAF|24]] and [[No. 47 Squadron RAF|47 Squadron]]s operating Handley Page Hastings Mks 1, 2 and 4. The three Mk 4 Hastings (\"shiny fleet\") belonged to 24 Squadron, serialled WD324, 326 and 500.\n\nAlso 1953, RAF Abingdon received the freedom of [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]].\n\nOn 22 April 1953 the spy [[George Blake]] arrived at RAF Abingdon, back from [[Korea]] via [[Moscow]] and [[Berlin]].<ref>{{cite book |url= https:\/\/books.google.co.uk\/books?id=jAG563wOhPgC&pg=PT109&lpg=PT109 |first=John Frayn |last=Turner |year=2012 |title=Traitor: British Double Agents 1930\u201380 |place= |publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] |isbn=978-1780967295 |page=109}}<\/ref> \n\nIn 1955 47 Squadron changed its Hastings for the [[Blackburn Beverley]]. Later 24 Squadron moved to [[RAF Colerne]]. It was replaced by [[No. 53 Squadron RAF]] operating the Beverley.\n\n===1961\u201392===\nBesides [[London University Air Squadron]], the [[Oxford University Air Squadron]] was based at RAF Abingdon. Abingdon was also the home of No. 6 AEF (Air Experience Flight) operating between 6\u20138 DHC Chipmunks for ATC\/CCF Air Cadet flight experience training. 6 AEF was one of a very few locations that offered air cadets the \"Air Cadet Navigator\" training course, leading to the award of Cadet Navigation Wings. \n\nIn the late 1960s the Blackburn Beverleys' hangars had dormer extensions put in the roof to take the extra height of the tailplane of the Short [[Short Belfast|Belfast]]<nowiki\/>s of No. 47 Squadron. Once the nose of the Belfast was in the hangar the nose had to be lifted to get the tail fin under the lip of the roof. The nose was then lowered and the tail fin rose up into the dormer roof for that parking position. No. 46 Squadron was also at Abingdon at this time flying [[Hawker Siddeley Andover|Andover]]s, one of their roles being to support UK MAMS (United Kingdom Mobile Air Movements). A small Army Air Dispatch unit was also supported by the airfield at this time. \n\nFrom 1975 through to the 1990s, Abingdon became a maintenance field, with the AMS (Aircraft Maintenance Squadron) servicing [[BAE Hawk]], [[SEPECAT Jaguar]] and [[Blackburn Buccaneer]] aircraft. In the early 80s the [[Battle of Britain Memorial Flight]]'s Lancaster bomber spent a couple of winters at RAF Abingdon to undergo major refurbishment. During this period, RAF Abingdon was also home to the Field Repair Squadron (later Repair & Salvage Squadron) which included Aircraft Repair Flight, Aircraft Salvage and Transportation Flight (formerly 71 MU \"Crash & Smash\") and Battle Damage Repair Flight. \n\nFrom 1986 to 1988 RAF Abingdon became home to the Thames Valley Police Air Support Unit, flying a [[helicopter]] in support of police operations. It was also the home of the London [[University Air Squadron]] in the seventies. An annual [[airshow]] took place at RAF Abingdon until the late eighties.\n\nFrom 1981 many ex-airline [[Vickers VC10]]s were stored at the station following their purchase by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MoD]]. By the early 1990s, the aircraft were either converted to [[Tanker aircraft|tanker]] configuration or scrapped. It was intended that the 3 Air Maintenance Support (3 AMS) unit would move from [[RAF Brize Norton]], only a few miles away, to undertake the major servicing of the VC10 military fleet. This would have involved the modification of a number of hangars to raise the roof to allow access for the VC10 high tail section at a cost of \u00a35m. A white paper to review defence requirements \"Option for Change\" recommended the closure of RAF Abingdon and that a new hangar, known as \"Twin Peaks\" be built at [[RAF St Athan]] with the reforming of 3 AMS, from [[RAF Brize Norton]] to 1 AMS at RAF St Athan in August 1992.\n\n===Squadrons===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The greater part of his life was spent at [[Truro]], where he acted for thirty years as sub-editor and reporter of the ''[[Royal Cornwall Gazette]]'', the old-established Tory paper of the county. He held also the posts of secretary to the Truro Public Rooms Company, and sub-manager of the Truro Savings Bank. For eleven years (1863\u201374) he edited the ''Journal of the [[Royal Institution of Cornwall]]'', and was involved in the management of the society. He died at Lemon Street, Truro, on 22 June 1874, aged 64.{{sfn|Courtney|1887}}\n\n==Writings==\nChorley was a man of wide scholarship, well versed in the classics and several modern languages, and of good classical taste. It was his custom to print for the private gratification of his friends, to whom alone the initials \u2018C. C.\u2019 revealed the authorship, small volumes of translations from the dead and living languages. The most important of them were versions of [[George Buchanan]]'s tragedies of ''Jephtha, or the Vow'', and ''The Baptist, or Calumny'', and two volumes of miscellaneous renderings from the German, Italian, Spanish, and French, as well as from the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. The titles of all these works may be read in the pages of the ''Bibliotheca Cornubiensis''. When the council of the Royal Institution of Cornwall purposed bringing out a volume under the title just given, the preparatory lists of the publications known to them were drawn up by Chorley and [[Thomas Quiller Couch]]. This scheme did not propose the inclusion of more than the works relating to the topography or the history of the county, and even with that limited area the design was beyond the power of persons not acquainted with the treasures of the British Museum.{{sfn|Courtney|1887}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n;Attribution\n{{DNB|wstitle=Chorley, Charles|first=William Prideaux|last= Courtney|volume=10}}\n\n==Sources==\n*''Journal of the Royal Institution of Cornwall'', October 1874, pp. iii\u2013iv, vii\n* G.
