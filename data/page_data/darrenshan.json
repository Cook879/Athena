When Tyler's father accused B of stealing, B's father beat him up. B was having a go at him once until a black girl, called [[Nancy]], stood up for him. B and Nancy ended up having a fight with each other until it was broken up. She was sent to [[Mrs. Reed]]'s office where the principal revealed that she felt the same about immigrants as B's father. \n\nOn a school trip to the [[Imperial War Museum]], B started to see that racism was really horrible. She then saw an Indian woman getting attacked and her baby was stoled. B chased them down and saved the baby, taking on two mutated people wearing hoodies. B was hailed as a hero as a result.\n\nWhen a zombie apocalypse broke out, B escaped from the gym with a few of her friends and other pupils, including Tyler. B took the lead, along with a black kid called [[Cass]], as they tried to escape. Eventually, most of the group was killed off. B was about to be killed when someone shoots the zombies who were trying to kill her. Her father comes to their rescue as they gunman was going after B next and they attempt to leave the school. When they find a blocked fire exit, B's father and some of the group tries to smash their way out. Before the door gave fully, the zombies approached them and B's father told her to throw Tyler to the zombies to buy time. B didn't want to at first but eventually did so. They then exited the building and tried to hold the door up again. \n\nB was sick at what she had done and hated her father because of it. To get away from him, B ended up going back into the building to face th zombies. She met up with the hooded man who stole the baby and she had been scratched by a zombie. The hooded man told her that she would become a zombie if she didn't die first.

Time can flow differently depending on the world you are in. Sometimes, time will flow slower than the Human Universe when in a Demonata world and sometimes it will flow faster. There is usually no way to tell although the more powerful magicians can sometimes tell.\n\nGravity is also different in some places. You can float with ease in some places. You can also jump further than normal in other worlds.\n\n== The Worlds ==\nMost powerful Demonata create a world to live in. These are fashioned in a way that the Demon finds fit to live in. They can be totally different to each other and have a lot of potential hazards in them. \n\n== Travel ==\nThe only known way to travel from world to world is through [[windows]].

He made a few friends in the army, [[Bill Phelps]], [[Abe Lambourne]] and [[Lars Liljegren]]. On Bill's twenty-fourth birthday, they all got drunk. In a bar, the four friends were sitting near two cadets they despised, [[Simon Dale]] and [[Parson McNally]]. A practical joke on them went wrong when Simon stabbed Abe in response. After, a fight broke out and McNally managed to run into the knife and also got stabbed. After this, Ed and the rest of the cadets involved, resigned from the army and went their separate ways.\n\nEventually, Ed ran into one of his old instructors, [[Carter Phell]], on a bar in Mexico. It turned out that Phell had tracked him down and helped him get straight again, helping him off the booze. Eventually, Phell revealed that he was hiring people to become assassins. Ed initially turned him down but Phell told him the offer would always be there.\n\nEd traveled the world a lot after that and eventually ended up in Seattle. Here, he met [[Belinda Darnier]], after he had been gambling and won a large sum of money. They dated for a couple of weeks but Ed thought that she would leave him once the money ran out. Ed got lucky again and won some more money which kept Belinda with him. One night, while Ed was high on coke, he told Belinda about his past with the army and what Phell asked him then she became even more interested in Ed. She started to respect him more, as if he was a celebrity. After the money ran out, Belinda stuck with Ed. Belinda eventually asked Ed to marry her and then they were married. Eventually, Belinda started to suffer from an illness. She came back from the hospital one day to tell Ed that it was cancer, before breaking down into tears. It turned out that it was a rare form of cancer in her brain. The doctor told Ed that the cancer could be treated but it would cost a few hundred thousand dollars for the treatment. Eventually, Ed decided to take Carter Phell up on his offer to get money.\n\n=== Life as an assassin ===\nEd went through two months of tough training, leaving Belinda for this time. He was taught all the skills he would need and he took to these skills well. Even though Ed had doubts, he decided to go all the way with becoming an assassin. A few days later, he was given his first assignment, a businessman in Germany. Ed slipped into his apartment and drowned him in the bath and made it look like an accident. After this, Ed began to see the ghost of the man he had killed. He thought he was going insane and was scared. He started to lash out at the ghost and began to make appointments with psychiatrists, only to break them as that would mean revealing what he had done. He only survived by putting Belinda's needs first. \n\nHis second assignment was a reporter who had been waging war on a major drug cartel. Although Ed begged to not be given this, he reluctantly did it as he was told he would not get another assignment. He tracked her for a week and managed to get past her guard and target her. He paused and the woman begged for her life. Ed might have given in but she then tried to escape so he shot her.\n\nAfter killing the journalist, Ed sunk into desperation. He hated both himself and Carter Phell. He even hated Belinda. He tried to leave Belinda but couldn't do it. He got another assignment, a gangster deserving of death, which went without a hitch. His fourth assignment broke him. He was sent to kill a minor Russian politician. He shot the rear wheel of his BMW as he was driving down a steep cliff, causing the car to veer off and crash. The next day, Ed read a newspaper which said that two had been killed in the \"accident\". It turned out that the politician wasn't alone in his car, his nine year old daughter was with him too, and had also been killed. Ed told Phell that he was quitting and Belinda understood too. Ed hated himself after this and started to withdraw from the world - until he got an unexpected visitor.\n\n=== Lies come to light ===\n\n\n[[Category:Lady of the Shades characters]]","timestamp":"20120924202013","user-timestamp":"20100927154120","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Edward_Sievking","comment":"Will k moved page [[Edward Sievking]] to [[Ed Sievking]] over redirect","content":"#REDIRECT [[Ed Sievking]]","timestamp":"20120925052042","user-timestamp":"20101216140923","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Future_wasteworld","comment":"Created page with '{{Location infobox |name= Earth |image= |location= |owner= |residents= [[Dragons]] |affiliation= |universe= [[The Saga of Darren Shan]] |first= {{Cx10}} |last= {{Cx12}} }}  The '\u2026'","content":"{{Location infobox\n|name= Earth\n|image=\n|location=\n|owner=\n|residents= [[Dragons]]\n|affiliation=\n|universe= [[The Saga of Darren Shan]]\n|first= {{Cx10}}\n|last= {{Cx12}}\n}}\n\nThe '''future wasteworld''' is a term used to describe [[Earth]] in the future.

They needed to find a way to get their numbers up and that is when the [[Demonata]] came into their world. The Demonata bred with the humans and they had babies. Some would transform into a wolfen-like creature in their teens. These were the first Werewolves. They were chained up in a few houses to stop them from killing any one. The lycanthropy gene was passed on through people and so the 'curse' was born.\n\n=== In Modern Days ===\nMany years later, the '''Grady Curse''' as it became known as, was still as strong as ever. The original family had branched off and everyone who suffered lycanthropy could be traced back to the Gardy family. Their was a series of scientists in the Grady family called [[The Lambs]]. These would take the wolfen human and supposedly kill them although it turned out that they were actually experimenting on them to try and cure the curse. They were kept in poor conditions and would often attack each other. Some werewolves were mutated into stronger variations of the other ones.\n\n==== Wolf Island ====\n[[Wolf Island (location)|Wolf Island]] became a haven for the werewolves. Their was a base that would keep the humans on the island safe here. The stronger werewolves would often take the role of leader of the packs. [[Grubbs]] and 12 soldiers and mages came here to stop what was going on. There was a massive fight here and Grubbs unleashed his inner wolf and killed the leader of a pack of werewolves. This led him to become leader. \n\n==== War of Earth ====\nWhen the Demonata started crossing over to kill humans, Grubbs and his werewolf army started an attack on the Demonata. Along with mages and soldiers, they killed many Demonata but still didn't stop them all.

It is a term that relates to their wolf like characteristics after transformation. The human gains wolf like characteristics every time there is a full moon. This will keep happening until the change is permanent. \n\n== The Saga of Darren Shan ==\nThe only known werewolf is the Wolfman. He is a permanent werewolf so may have changed several times if related to the Grady curse. However, since he is from a different series, he may be totally unrelated.\n\n== Demonata Saga ==\n=== History ===\n==== Start of the Curse ====\nThe first werewolf came around between 350 and 400 AD. Distant relatives of the [[Grady family]] were loosing numbers and needed more people. They decided to breed with the [[Demonata]]. This resulted in some warped offspring, only when they reach teenage years. Some become werewolves, others do not. This 'curse' was passed down through generations.\n\n=== In Modern Days ===\nMany years later, the '''Grady Curse''' as it became known as, was still as strong as ever. The original family had branched off and everyone who suffered lycanthropy could be traced back to the Gardy family. Their was a series of scientists in the Grady family called [[The Lambs]]. These would take the wolfen human and supposedly kill them although it turned out that they were actually experimenting on them to try and cure the curse. They were kept in poor conditions and would often attack each other. Some werewolves were mutated into stronger variations of the other ones.\n\n==== Wolf Island ====\n[[Wolf Island (location)|Wolf Island]] became a haven for the werewolves. Their was a base that would keep the humans on the island safe here. The stronger werewolves would often take the role of leader of the packs. [[Grubbs]] and 12 soldiers and mages came here to stop what was going on. There was a massive fight here and Grubbs unleashed his inner wolf and killed the leader of a pack of werewolves. This led him to become leader. \n\n==== War of Earth ====\nWhen the Demonata started crossing over to kill humans, Grubbs and his werewolf army started an attack on the Demonata. Along with mages and soldiers, they killed many Demonata but still didn't stop them all. Grubbs had three loyal Werewolves, [[Curly]], [[Larry]] and [[Moe]] who kept the other werewolves in order. \n\n=== Known Werewolves ===\n*[[Grubbs Grady]]\n*[[Gret Grady]]\n*[[Bill-E Spleen]]\n*[[Curly]]\n*[[Larry]]\n*[[Moe]]\n\n== Appearances ==\n{{appearances}}\n=== [[The Saga of Darren Shan]] ===\n*''[[Cirque Du Freak]]''\n*''[[The Vampire's Assistant]]''\n==== Movies ====\n*[[Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant]]\n=== [[Demonata (series)|Demonata]] ===\n*''{{Dx01}}''\n*''{{Dx03}}'' {{C|mentioned}}\n*''{{Dx04}}''\n*''{{Dx05}}'' {{C|mentioned}}\n*''{{Dx08}}''\n*''{{Dx09}}''\n*''{{Dx10}}''\n\n[[Category:Species]]","timestamp":"20091103214425","user-timestamp":"20100927154120","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Werewolves","comment":"Redirected page to [[Werewolf]]","content":"#REDIRECT [[Werewolf]]","timestamp":"20091103214837","user-timestamp":"20100927154120","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Window","comment":"Created page with 'A '''Window''' is a type of magical doorway that can lead to another world, or even another universe.

The story follows [[B Smith]] as a [[zombie]] apocalypse breaks out.\n\n== Plot ==\n=== Then ===\nIn the small Irish town of [[Pallaskenry]], shouting and screaming wakes [[Brian Barry]] up. He finds his mother eating his father's brain before running out of the house to try and find a way to escape. He eventually comes across a [[Owl man|a man who looks a bit like an owl]] who seems to be immune to the zombies. Brian begs for his life and the man tells him to kneel and pray. After doing so, the man snaps his neck, killing him.\n\n=== Now ===\nReports of this attack start to come across the news in England. However, many think it is a hoax or a publicity stunt. B Smith lives with her racist father, [[Todd Smith]], and mother, [[Daisy Smith]]. Todd has anger issues and beats both B and Daisy if they anger him. B has a relatively normal life otherwise, hanging out with her friends at the park and not doing that well in school. However, B has a constant fight with herself on whether she is actually racist, like her father, or whether she is just acting.\n\nOne day at school, B gets into a fight with a black girl called [[Nancy]] after B was having a go at [[Tyler]]. After this incident, she went to see the principal, [[Mrs. Reed]]. Mrs. Reed agrees with B's father's ways of thinking and calls her a racist. B became upset about this as she didn't want to be racist but was scared that she might be. She didn't want to be like her father.\n\nOn a trip to the [[Imperial War Museum]], B sees displays about the concentration camps from Nazi Germany. These affect her and she begins to see that racism is horrible and not right. After walking through the displays, she goes off alone to think. She then sees an Indian woman have her baby kidnapped by two hooded men and then makes chase after them. She attacks one of them with a knee smash and carries on after the other man. The man drops his hood to reveal a rotted face, like a mutant. After a confrontation, the man throws the baby and B catches it, and is hailed as a hero.\n\nAfter Todd finds out about this, he is angry that B saved an Indian baby. After B's mother disagreed with him, he attacked both her and B. A few days later, B goes back to school and everything seems to go back to normal. However, during a five a side football match, several injured students come into the gym and zombies follow them. All hell breaks loose as the pupils and teachers try and escape. B, several of her friends, Tyler and a few other children, including a tough black kid called [[Cass]], find themselves trapped together. They try a fire exit to find it is blocked. They are then attacked by a zombie who attacks [[Pox]]. They kill the zombie and decide to take Pox with them for the time being. They barricade themselves into a classroom where Pox then turns into a zombie. Pox then attacks both [[Dunglop]] and [[Rick]] before the others run out of the room, leaving them there. They head for another exit, up the stairs. On the way, [[La Lips]] is attacked and [[Copper]] goes to help her, also getting bitten. They start to go up the stairs and Cass is attacked by zombies there. The rest of the group leave him and carry on. Tyler suggests they head to the kitchen to get knifes and they head there and look through the door to see many hooded mutants controlling the zombies. They leave and try the other fire exit to find it locked as well. They then see Mrs. Reed eating [[Jonesenzio]]'s brain, before she then speaks. She asks B to stay as she is full for now, but will be hungry again soon. They then are approached by more hooded mutants before they run again.\n\nOn the way, [[Linzer]] announces that she is hiding. The group leaves her and carries on. B smashes through a window into the courtyard and is followed by most of the group. [[Suze]] doesn't jump as she is scared of heights and [[Ballydefeck]] goes back to help her down. They are then both dragged back by zombies. They then see Linzer, in another window, getting attacked. At that point, only nine of them were left: B, [[Trev]], [[Meths]], [[Elephant]], [[Stagger Lee]], Tyler, [[Seez]] and a Muslim boy and Indian boy. They head through some other corridors and Tyler leads them to the front of the building. They are then attacked by Pox and Rick. Then, someone shoots both of the zombies. They are about to shoot B until B's father comes running in and stops him, yelling \"that's my girl\". Her father than reveals her name is \"Becky\". The group makes their way out of the building, only to find the fire exit that Todd entered from was locked. They smashed through most of the door but needed more time. Todd told B to throw Tyler to the zombies to make time. She does this after a bit of thought and after her father started to yell at her and Tyler is turned into a zombie. The rest of the group make it out of the building but B, now sick at the thought that she had killed someone, just because he was black, headed back into the building to take her chance with the zombies rather than stay with her father. She is then scratched by a zombie before Tyler attacks her and rips her heart out, killing her.\n\n[[Category:Zom-B]]\n[[Category:Books]]","timestamp":"20120927101343","user-timestamp":"20100927154120","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"1","title":"Darren_O'Shaughnessy","comment":"Solar Dragon moved page [[Talk:Darren O'Shaughnessy]] to [[Talk:Darren Shan]] over redirect","content":"#REDIRECT [[Talk:Darren Shan]]","timestamp":"20120924182642","user-timestamp":"20100927154120","lang":"en"},{"namespace":"1","title":"Vampires","comment":"Created page with '== Protection == I have temporarily protected this page until I finish it.

He is a demon with green skin, flames for eyeballs, insects (that vary) constantly eating his scalp and a small mouth in each of its palms filled with sharp teeth (but no tongue).  His bodily proportions are similar to a toddler's, but he has a much bigger head than any human.  He is [[Lord Loss (character)|Lord Loss]]'s favourite familiar, and was partnered with Vein (a wolf demon with a crocodile's head and a woman's hands), until she was killed for disobeying Lord Loss.  He has appeared in every book so far, although his appearance in 'Bec' is debatable as there is a demon with a similar description to him but it is not named.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n*'''''[[Lord Loss]]''''': Artery appeared during the massacre of Grubbs family, and fought Grubbs while Dervish was playing chess against Lord Loss\n\n*'''''[[Demon Thief]]''''': Artery was stolen by Kernel, and Kernel used enormous amounts of magic to sculpt his features into that of a two year old human.\n\n*'''''[[Slawter]]''''': Artery does not have a big part in this book, but he appeared beside Lord Loss during the slaughter.\n\n*'''''[[Bec (character)|Bec]]''''':  His appearance in this book is debatable.

He has definitely appeared in five books, and may have appeared in Bec ''(See above)'', so it is likely that he will play an important role in the series. It is strange that Artery is so important to Lord Loss as he is not one of the most powerful demons.

It is the fourth book released of the series, but so far it will be first chronologically. The protagonist of the book is the central character [[Bec McConn]]. It takes place in [[Ireland]] around 1600 years ago.\n\n==Plot Summary==\nBec is a young orphan living in a small ring fort in Celtic Ireland who is studying to be a priestess. She's not especially powerful, but she has an extraordinary memory, as she can remember her own birth. Her teacher, Banba, believes she can one day prove herself useful to the clan they live with. It is a time of great change -- Christians have arrived at the island and many clans have already converted to the new religion. Bec's clan still clings to the old ways, but they know they cannot stand against the tide of Christianity for much longer. Bec is worried -- where will a priestess of ancient magic like her fit into the new world? But then her people are faced with a far greater threat -- demons invade and take over much of the island. Night becomes a time of fighting and bloodshed. The world seems poised to fall to the demon invaders. When a \"simple child\" named Bran who can run incredibly fast comes to Bec's rath, she and a small consignment of warriors go with him, including the chief's son, Connla, who is \"largely untested\" in battle, Goll an old warrior, Lorcan and Ronan; two teenage twins, Fiachna the blacksmith, and Orna a female warrior. He leads them to a crannog, where everyone is dead except a druid, Drust. The druid tells them about a tunnel to the demon's world, and how he aims to destroy it. They go with him.\n\nDuring their journey, they encounter many demons, including when Bec battles Lord Loss. She appears to absorb power from him, and after the encounter begins to learn magic at a phenomenal rate. Drust gets worried, and asks her for permission to go into her mind (like Dervish Grady asks Grubbs in Slawter). It then turns out that Lord Loss had given her part of his power, opening up her magical side, though no one knows for what purposes.\n\nEventually they arrive at a village, where Bec learns about her heritage and that she is part of those prone to lycanthropy (This is a link to the Garadexes, Grubbs' ancestors). After a long journey, they arrive at the cliffs. Lord Loss appears, intrigued by a chessboard Drust got from the Elders. He is then thrown out magically, and places a geis (a demon curse) on them. Bec and Drust use magic to go down into an underwater cave, and they meet the Old Creatures, who tell them where the tunnel is and how to destroy it. It emerges that a druid or priestess must be sacrificed, with reveals why Drust needs Bec. Back on dry land, while Bec and Drust are talking about the sacrifice, Bran overhears and tries to help.\n\nWhen they arrive at the tunnel, Connla betrays the group, revealing he was working for Lord Loss all along and it was he who caused all the deaths of the others who were once part of their party. Bec pushes him under a waterfall, breaking his protective spell of demonic blood and allowing the demons to slaughter him. When Bec is about to be sacrificed, Drust is knifed in the back by Bran and Bec realizes Bran wouldn't let her die. Drust tells her to use him as the sacrifice, as he is about to die anyway. When the tunnel is destroyed, Brude's mouth starts to close. They appear to be able to make for the exit initially, but Vein (one of Lord Loss' familiar) catches onto her leg. She fights her off, but too slowly. They lost their chance to make it out of the tunnel in time. As the tunnel starts to close, Bec uses her magic to force Bran to use his running skills to escape. The tunnel closes and Lord Loss appears to her, revealing that closing the tunnel makes no difference, and that he has been walking the earth for hundreds of years before this tunnel was opened. He then apologizes to Bec, but says he must go through with the geis he placed on them, and walks off with Drust's chessboard (possibly to be seen in Demon Thief later). In the last sentences of the book she is seen fighting desperately to the death with the demons, trapped in the tunnel. Presumably, the only survivor of the group of warriors is Bran.\n\n==External Links==\n* [http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/exec\/obidos\/ASIN\/0007231318 Amazon.co.uk Listing]\n* [http:\/\/www.darrenshan.com\/monthly\/archive\/2006\/2006-march.html Shanville Monthly 68]\n\n[[Category:Books]]\n[[Category:Books narrated by Bec]]\n[[Category:Demonata Books]]","timestamp":"20080504185039","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Bec_(book)","comment":"moved [[Bec (book)]] to [[Bec]]","content":"#REDIRECT [[Bec]]","timestamp":"20091014215354","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Bec_MacGrigor","comment":"[[Bec MacGrigor]] moved to [[Bec McConn]]","content":"#REDIRECT [[Bec McConn]]","timestamp":"20080503170523","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Bec_McConn","comment":"New page: '''Bec (meaning Little One) MacGrigor''' is a fictional character in Darren Shan's [[The Demonata|Demonata]] series and title narrator of [[Bec]] (which takes place over a thousand years b...","content":"'''Bec (meaning Little One) MacGrigor''' is a fictional character in Darren Shan's [[The Demonata|Demonata]] series and title narrator of [[Bec]] (which takes place over a thousand years before '''Demon Thief'''). She was a member of the MacGrigor clan (though she is raised by the McConn clan) and is distantly related to [[Grubbs Grady]]. She was training to be priestess and was taught by Banba and had an extraordinary memory.\n\n\n== Biography==\n===Death==\nBec dies(presumably) when she tries to escape from the lodestone after killing Drust she and Bran try to flee and come close until Vein, who came back from the demonata realm through a window constructed by Lord Loss, grabs hold of Bec's leg. Bran charms Vein but in that time the hole to escape is so small they would not be able to make it. Bec uses what is left of her magic to send Bran forcibly through the hole. Just before it closes he shouts \"Bec!\" through the hole, this is the first time he says anyones name. She can not reply as the hole closes and she is presumably killed by Lord Loss' familiars after he explains why he helped the group by increasing Bec's power (the reason being that Lord Loss feeds off misery not death; were the world destroyed then his food source would similarly vanish) He also tells her her death was for nothing, as he had been crossing between the demon world and the human world for centuries before, and once he gets bored of playing with is food, he placed a geis (the demon curse of death) upon her. \n\n===Resurrection==\nShe reappears in [[Blood Beast]] when Grubbs is dealing with the family curse he goes to the tunnel where Bec died. He sees her face and hears her whisper a warning, but she is speaking Celtic so Grubbs doesn't understand. Later when Juni helps Grubbs escape he returns there. The whispers are more warning. Grubbs yells at her \"I don't understand you\" and using his magic shakes the cave violently. She then disappears.\n\nAt the end of Book 6, Bec uses the body of the deceased Bill-E Spleen to re-build her own body, and is revealed to be the third piece of the [[Kah-Gash]].\n\n== Powers and Abilities ==\nBec is very powerful and it states in the book \"demon apocalypse\" that she is more powerful than both Beranabus and Grubbs. Her trainer when she was younger was Banba, but she was struck and killed by a demon, thus Bec's training ended and she lost some power. One thing that does sustain is her memory, it is so perfect she can even remember her own birth and the memory allowed her to remember all the spells she is ever taught. After Bran appears she meets Drust who teaches her druid spells and increases her power. However her power truly increases when Lord Loss lends her his power.She is a piece of the Kah-Gash. It is possible that Lord Loss was the one who created the piece of the Kah-Gash inside her (unknowingly), meaning that he could be the one that brings about his own destruction, (the Kah-Gash can be used to destroy universes).\n\n==Appearances==\n\n* '''[[Bec]]''' (narrator)\n* '''[[Blood Beast]]'''\n* '''[[Demon Apocalypse]]'''\n* '''[[Death's Shadow]]''' (narrator)","timestamp":"20080105203927","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Beranabus","comment":"New page: '''The leader of The Disciples''', and a real magician, as opposed to a mage.

Appearance-wise, he wears a very old suit with a sad looking flower in it, and has dirty teeth, leading to an overall very unkempt appearance. Although he is very magically strong, he is often criticised by the other Disciples for being somewhat sadistic, giving up humans in smaller battles for, what he claims is a greater good, the search for the Kah-Gash. He is also criticised for being somewhat cruel in his methods for recruiting mages into The Disciples, and for keeping them in the group against their will. However, he confesses that he really does feel sorry for them, but, once again, claims that its all part of a greater good. Kernel Fleck believes that, although some think that he doesn't have feelings, he simply does a better job of hiding them than others.\n\nThough most about his past is unknown, he claims that a demon universe featuing a waterfall of blood was a favorite place of his mother. He claims that his mother was \"not as such\" a magician, and died after he was born. He has also shown contempt towards his father. He confesses that as a child, he felt confused and alone in the world.\n\nAside from his appearance in The Disciples in Demon Thief, he is mentioned in Slawter, though his appearances in Bec and Blood Beast are debated. Bec features a character \"Bran\" who expresses several magical abilities. There is much speculation that Bran is connected to Beranabus in some way due to their similar names and abilities. It is almost certain that Beranabus appeared in Blood Beast, as Grubbs Grady runs into a man in a suit with an odd accent, and this after his uncle attempted to contact Beranabus. Beranabus may even be a grown-up Bran as it is explained in Demon Thief how time works differently. Beranabus also wears flowers in a buttonhole, Bran had a strange liking for flowers. In Bec, Bran has a short sword, in Demon Thief, Lord Loss shows him a similar sword and claims it used to be his. Nadia explains in Demon Thief that when she and Beranabus returned to the human universe, they stayed in a cave, this may be the cave in which the of Bec was set. Also it is said that Beranabus's mission is to stop demon masters from crossing which was the misson set in Bec.","timestamp":"20070910190049","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Beranabus'_father","comment":"New page: *Spoilers may lie ahead*   '''Kernel Fleck''' is one of the main protagonists of the Demonata series he first apears in Demonata book 2 \"Demon Theif\" where he abducts one of Lord Loss' fam...","content":"*Spoilers may lie ahead*\n\n\n'''Kernel Fleck''' is one of the main protagonists of the Demonata series he first apears in Demonata book 2 \"Demon Theif\" where he abducts one of Lord Loss' familiars in belief that he is his brother.

Dervish and Grubbs saved his life but he was not informed of that fact until a few months later. He also has a noticeably lazy eye.

This begins the reopening of the tunnel seen in [[Bec]]. \n\nBilly's life is ended when Grubbs kills him in [[Demon Apocalypse]] to avoid the reopening of the tunnel. \n\n==Close family==\n===[[Grubbs Grady]]===\n\n'''[[Grubbs Grady]]''', (short for Grubitsch Grady) is Billy's half-brother. Billy befriends him when he moves in with Dervish at Carcerry Vale. Like his [[Dervish Grady|Uncle Dervish]] he also has a cruel taste in pranks. Yet Grubbs never exactly told Bill-E that he was his half-brother as he intended to in the end of Slawter, he still waits for the right moment to bring it up.\n\n===[[Cal Grady]]===\n\n'''Cal Grady''' was Grubbs (and Billy's) father and Dervish's brother.  It appeared that he was happily married to Sharon, his wife, but it turned out that while visiting Dervish in Carcery Vale he had a one night stand with a local woman, resulting in the birth of Bill-E.\n\n===[[Ma Spleen| Ma]] And [[Pa Spleen]]===\n\n'''Ma and Pa Spleen''' are Bill-E's over protective grandparents. In [[Blood Beast]] they are killed by Grubbs when he is struck with lycanthropy, but later revealed to be killed by Juni Swan (or Nadia Moore).\n\n===[[Dervish Grady]]===\n \n'''Dervish Grady''' is Billy's uncle. He battles Lord Loss along side Grubbs when fighting to cure Billy of his Lycanthropy.\n\n== Biography ==\nBilly first meets [[Grubbs]], who is actually his half-brother, in [[Lord Loss]]. They soon become good friends and spend a lot of time with each other. At the end of Lord Loss, [[Dervish]] tells Grubbs that Billy is really his brother, but they decide not to tell Billy.\n\nIn Slawter Grubbs and Dervish take him to the Slawter set with them.\n\nIn [[Blood Beast]], his relationship with Grubbs becomes strained. Grubbs now has a group of new friends, including Loch Gossel, who constantly picks on Billy, and he harly spends any time with Billy anymore. The day after Grubbs's party, he becomes very frustrated with Loch and decides to go look for Lord Sheftree's treasure. After Grubbs explains to Loch what the treasure is and how he and Billy used to go searching for it, Loch decides to join Billy in the search; because he is not feeling well, Grubbs does not want to go, but the other two convince him to join them. After a long time of searching, Loch is about to leave, but Grubbs recognizes the place where they are from when Billy and he were spying on [[Dervish]] in [[Lord Loss]], so he decides to dig one last hole there. What they do not realize at the time is that this is actually the entrance to the cave from [[Bec]] after having been filled in. They begin to think that this must be where the treasure is buried, so the decide to dig here everyday until they find it. One day, after the hole has gotten to be several feet deep, Billy is digging by himself in the hole until he breaks through the dirt that had been used to fill in the hole, revealing the shaft that leads to the cave. After some hesitance from Grubbs, the three go down into the cave. The all begin to explore the cave for the treasure. After giving up on the treasure, Billy and Loch decide to try to climb one of the cave walls, but Grubbs decides not to because he is feeling ill. As they are climbing, Loch slips and falls off of the wall, hitting his head. As Billy goes to get help, Loch dies from [[head trauma]]. Billy blames himself for not catching him as he fell, and he becomes very depressed; Grubbs tries to comfort him be telling him that he would have just been dragged down with Loch because of his weight, but it does not help much.\n\nAt the end of [[Demon Apocalypse]], Grubbs is forced to kill Bill-E to close the tunnel.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n* [[Lord Loss]]\n* [[Slawter]]\n* [[Blood Beast]]\n* [[Demon Apocalypse]]\n\n[[Category: Demonata Characters]]","timestamp":"20080104202718","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Bill_Casey","comment":"Created page with \"[[File:Placeholder|right|300px]] Bill Casey is a kind of antagonist and is the one that killed everyone that Al was near to.

It is narrated by Grubbs Grady, the narrator of Lord Loss and Slawter. The plot is part of a two part story, along with book six. Though the previous four books have not been in chronological order, this book is the furthest book into the future. It mainly deals with whether or not Grubbs Grady will be struck with lycanthropy and how he will deal with this problem.\n\nThe title was originally announced at the Edinburgh Book Festival, and Darren Shan read a small sequence about a demon attack on a plane, which featured Lord Loss.\n\n= Plot =\n\nBlood Beast is set about a year after Slawter. It begins back Dervish's house where Grubbs begins to feel alarming symptoms in connection with the full moon. He is having dreadful nightmares full of Demons and his sister, Gret, who keeps coming close to killing him. Also, in these dreams he has changed to a werewolf, but Grubbs attempts to convince himself that these nightmares are only normal. On top of this, his magicians prowess is growing all the time. He makes water change direction as it goes down the plughole (defying gravity) and claims to have woken from his nightmares levitating.\n\nGrubbs has got back to life as usual, and has got a crowd of friends, including a new best friend, Loch Gossel, who constantly bullies Grubbs half brother, Bill-E. At school there is a certain girl he likes called Reni Gossel, the sister of Loch. After Dervish has to go away for the weekend to say goodbye to Meera Flame, Grubbs throws a big house party. Reni, Loch, Bill-E and a few more stay the night. They play spin the bottle and Grubbs kisses with Reni for the first time. He is so excited by this, he accidentally uses his magic powers. The bottle starts levitating and then explodes. He freezes the bottle in time and turns the shattered glass into Butterflies and flower petals. Half way through the night, Grubbs wakes up to a howling noise. He finds himself in the bathroom. He then realises the growling is coming from him. He looks in the mirror to find that he has become a werewolf, but somehow he changes himself back to normal.\n\nThe next morning, Bill-E and Loch decide to go and look for Lord Sheftree's treasure, but Grubbs isn't feeling well and protests greatly, but eventually gives in. The three set about digging and just as Loch is about to go home, they find a spot that Grubbs remembers Dervish being before. They start digging, but there are big rocks in the way which are hard to move. The boys go home but make a pact to come back after school every day until they find the treasure. Dervish returns home, but was drunk the previous night and fell into a deep sleep, so Grubbs couldn't tell him about the nightmares and fear of lycanthropy.\n\nGrubbs goes to sleep, but later wakes up and finds himself at the hole moving the heavy rocks, by himself. He runs back to the house and goes back to sleep. When Bill-E and Loch see the hole the next day, they are amazed and believe that Lord Sheftree planted bombs to kill those that tried to get his treasure, but the simply were old and detonated late. As they are digging, they begin to get very angry at each other and bicker, even try to kill each other. Grubbs feels magic in the air, and feels that it may be affecting the three, but tells the other two that it must be chemicals in the soil.\n\nLoch and Grubbs climb out of the hole and start to talk to each when they hear a scream. The floor has given way and Bill-E is hanging on for his life. They hoist him up, and look down. The rocks gave way to a deep tube, but one that might be able to climb down. After a debate, the three decide to go down. At the bottom, they find a cave full of stalactites and stalagmites with a large waterfall. They start looking for the treasure but find none.\n\nBill-E and Loch decide to climb a wall of the cave. At this point, Grubbs begins to feel very ill (possibly because of the full moon) and looks to the floor of the cavern. He sees a girls face in the rock similar to his sister's[1]) whispering in a strange language, but then she suddenly goes silent. Grubbs hears a scream from behind him and a thud. He turns around to find Loch's lifless body lying on the floor, blood seeping out of his head. Grubbs attempts to heal the wounds while Bill-E leaves to get help. While Bill-E is gone, Grubbs needs to recussitate Loch several times. The first two times it works, but then on the third, Loch stops breathing, his heart stops beating, and he dies. The whispering starts again and Grubbs starts to freak out. When he calms down he looks at Loch, and lifts up his head and notices something odd - all the blood is gone.\n\nEventually Dervish and Bill-E turn up at the cave, however there is nothing that can be done to save Loch's life and Grubbs soon realises that there is no ambulance. Dervish says that they cannot let an ambulance come to the cave. The boys protest, but he says that he will explain to them later. The three of them move the body of Loch to a nearby quarry and throw it over a cliff edge.\n\nDervish explains later the Grubbs why this is necessary - the cave is one where demons can create a strong doorway into the human world (presumably the same cave from Bec). Dervish has been given the duty to protect the cave and make sure nobody else can unleash the Demonata. Although hard to accept at first, Grubbs and Bill-E play along after being investigated by the police.\n\nOne week later Grubbs returns to school. The psychologist has left the school, and a new one has come as a replacement. Grubbs is sent to meet her and finds out it is Juni Swan, a psychologist that Grubbs and Dervish met on the set of Slawter. Juni helps Grubbs, Bill-E, and their friends to cope with Loch's death, and soon everyone seems to be dealing fine. However tensions increase as Juni meets up with Dervish and both become romantically involved, eventually moving in with Dervish. Juni tells Grubbs and Dervish that since Slawter, her magic has advanced tremendously. This encourages Dervish, and he teaches her more spells and continues to see her more and more.\n\nIn the following days Grubbs becomes more aware of the impending doom of his curse. Not only that, but he begins to notice a tramp coincidentally appearing around Carcery Vale. The tramp has an appearance nearly identical to Beranabus from Demon Thief, and may in fact be him. This is supported by the fact that Dervish attempts to contact Beranabus slightly before the tramp appears. On one of his late night jogs, Grubbs notices the tramp near by the cave, the tramp tells him, \"It won't be long.\" This immediately leads to Grubbs suspicion that Dervish called the Lambs. Grubbs gets Juni to ask Dervish about this for him, and she claims that Dervish did call them, but also goes on to tell him that she'll do whatever it takes to stop Grubbs from being killed, and that she sees him as her own son.\n\nFor several nights around the time of the full moon, Grubbs has what he describes as a battle between his human and werewolf sides. During these times, he is in extreme pain while Juni and Dervish need to hold him down. Grubbs suggests that they put him in a cage that Dervish owns for the next night. During that evening, while in the cage, Juni suggests that Dervish leaves while she performs a dangerous spell to help Grubbs. Once Dervish is gone, she frees Grubbs from the cage, then passionately kisses him when he shows his desire to die at the hands of the Lambs, claiming that she will not let him be killed while there may be hope. She says that they should go to meet up at the cave. he then breaks out of the cage, and battles 3 of what he believes are Lambs, dispatching them easily. It is not known whether Dervish did actually call the Lambs or if the people Grubbs attacks while escaping the cellar are actually Lambs, as Juni may very likely have lied to Grubbs about Dervish's call.\n\nGrubbs runs to the cave, where he loses control again and turns into a werewolf. When he returns to his normal state, Grubbs finds that he has killed Ma & Pa Spleen, Bill-E's grandparents and legal guardians. Not wanting to kill again, Juni says that the two of them need to run away from Dervish and the Lambs to protect Grubbs, both from his own death and the deaths of others.\n\nThe two of them go to an airport, and board a plane, all of which is very distant to Grubbs. He falls asleep while on the plane. When he awakes, the plane is shaking, apparently due to turbulence. However, soon the cockpit opens and demons appear on the plane, Artery first and then the scorpion like creature from the front of the book. They both begin killing the passengers on the plane along with another rabbit-like demon. Finally, Lord Loss appears in the plane, stunning the passengers. Juni appears next to him and reveals that she summoned him and is actually a familiar of Lord Loss. The book ends with her declaring, \"He's all yours now- master.\" The book then on a to be continued, with the words \"What the hell's coming next?\" underneath the title Book Six...\n\n= Notes =\n\n*On page 255 in place of the normal Chapter Heading, \"Fly Me To The Moon\", the font is somewhat mirrored. Behind this is the name of the first chapter of the book \"Damn the Sandman\". Many fans thought that there was a significance to this, but the author confirmed that it was only a typo.\n*The face Grubbs saw is most likely Bec, as she is a distant cousin of Grubbs. Also, they are presumably in the cave where she died 1500 years before, and the cave had previously had another face in it. If this is Bec, it will be the first time in the series that a narrator has appeared in a book that they have not narrated.\n*It is possible that Loch was murdered by Bill-E; we are not shown the exact circumstances of his death, and given the corrupting powers of the cave it is possible that Bill-E pushed him to his death. If so, then again it would count as a sacrifice.\n*Dervish said to contact \"him\", asking for a magician to re-enact the spells sealing the cave. This could mean that [[Beranabus]] might appear in the next book, along with Kernel, in the cave, with Grubbs and Bec... This would explain a possible concurrence of the three narraters.","timestamp":"20070909155931","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Blooding","comment":"Created page with ''''Blooding''' someone is the act of turning them into a [[vampire]] (or half-vampire, in [[Darren]]'s case).

The movie began filming on February 8, 2008 in New Orleans and ended June 3, 2008. The film is distributed by Universal Studios. Some of the movie was filmed on a set constructed within New Orleans City Park, approximately 1000 feet off of the side of the road, along Harrison Avenue. The film was originally set for release on January 15, 2010, but was moved forward to October 23, 2009.\n\n==Plot summary==\n\nThe Vampire's Assistant is a fantasy-adventure about a teenager who unknowingly breaks a 200-year-old truce between two warring factions of vampires. Pulled into a fantastic life of misunderstood sideshow freaks and grotesque creatures of the night, one teen will vanish from the safety of a boring existence and fulfill his destiny in a place drawn from nightmares.\n\n16-year-old [[Darren]] (Chris Massoglia) was like most kids in his suburban neighborhood. He hung out with his best friend [[Steve]] (Josh Hutcherson), got decent grades, and usually stayed out of trouble. But when he and Steve stumble upon a traveling freak show, things begin to change inside Darren. That\u2019s the exact moment when a vampire named [[Larten Crepsley]] (John C. Reilly) turns him into something bloodthirsty.\n\nNewly undead, he joins the Cirque Du Freak, a touring sideshow filled with monstrous creatures from a [[Evra Von|snakeboy]] (Patrick Fugit) and a [[wolfman]] (Tom Woodruff, Jr.) to a [[Madame Truska|bearded lady]] (Salma Hayek) and a [[Mr. Tall|gigantic ringmaster]] (Ken Watanabe). As Darren flexes his newfound powers in this dark world, he becomes a treasured pawn between the vampires and their deadlier counterparts. And while trying to survive, one boy will struggle to keep their brewing war from devouring what\u2019s left of his humanity.\n\n==Cast==\n\n''See main article: [[Cast]]''\n\n==Production==\n\nCirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant was shot in New Orleans, the village of Folsom and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Some of the characters required a great deal of prosthetics and makeup led by Steve Koch, Brian Sipe and Mark Garbarino. Prosthetics did not quite add the height needed on certain shots for the character of Mr. Tall played by Academy Award-nominated Ken Watanabe. Although Watanabe\u2019s height of 6 feet is tall, a body double was cast for certain shots. Trevon Flores, a local basketball player, stands at 6-foot-10, 210-pounds and was used for certain shots to show the abnormal height of Mr. Tall. Additionally, Ken Watanabe utilized dialogue coaches Kathleen S. Dunn and Francie Brown in pre-production and production to further enhance his performance as the circus barker. The filmmakers will be taking advantage of computer-generated imagery to portray other fantasy elements.\n\nRecently, John Marshall High School (Los Angeles) was used to film a few parts of the movie. They also used Lusher Charter School in New Orleans to shoot a couple of scenes from the film.\n\nAccording to IMDb, filming of The Vampire's Assistant is now finished.\n\nThe film is rated PG-13 for sequences of intense supernatural violence and action, disturbing images, thematic elements, and some language.\n\nThey also changed Darrens love interest Debbie Hemlock, but because of so many complaints they claim they will bring her into one of the later films.\n\n==Music==\n\nThe score to The Vampire's Assistant was composed by Stephen Trask, marking his third feature film with director Paul Weitz. He recorded his score with an 86-piece ensemble of the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Newman Scoring Stage at 20th Century Fox.\n\n==External links==\n\n* [http:\/\/www.thevampiresassistant.net\/ Official site]\n* [http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0450405\/ The Vampire's Assistant at IMDb]\n\n[[Category:Content]]","timestamp":"20091007224641","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Cirque_du_Freak_Wiki","comment":"Redirected page to [[Main Page]]","content":"#REDIRECT [[Main_Page]]","timestamp":"20091007224320","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"City_of_Snakes","comment":"Created page with ''''''City of the Snakes''''' is the third volume in [[The City trilogy]].

Steve paints a picture of the Vampanese being rightous and kind whereas Vampires are cold and kill those from which they feed then bloods his son making him a half-vampanese. He teaches him to shoot with an&nbsp;arrow gun and sends him to the Cirque when it comes back to Darren&nbsp;and Steve's hometown. Darius then tricks Darren into giving him a ticket to the Cirque Du Freak which he brings back to his father&nbsp;who gives the ticket to his childhood friend Tommy Jones which also results in his death by the hands of R.V and Morgan at his championship soccor game at which Darren is attending. Later on Darren almost kills Darius but spares his life knowing that Steve will want his son in exchange for Evra's son Shancus whom he is holding hostage. After Steve kills Shancus, Darren almost kills Darius again but cannot when Steve announces that Darius is not only his son but Darren's nephew. Darren takes Darius home to Annie (who believed Darren to be dead) \nand tells her they must leave but not before he reveals the fact that Darius has been blooded and that something must be done because Vampanese must kill when they feed.

But after he encounters the demon Spine and his eyes are torn away from their sockets, he has to rebuild them so that he can see again. With these new eyes in place, he begins to see some new lights that he cannot move, and which seem to be whispering to the Disciples, manipulating them. However Kernel realises that he is unable to tell anyone of his concerns as no-one else can see the lights. When the whispering lights lead them to a ship where the groups most terrifying foe yet \u201cThe Shadow\u201d, Kernel guards the portal and is approached by a ball made up of the whispering lights, which tells him to leave his friends and follow it. Kernel is unwilling but is forced through the window by the sphere of lights. The lights take the shape of Art - the boy Kernel once thought was his brother - to gain Kernel's trust.\n\n\"Art\" then tells Kernel that he is needed to save the universe and is taken to the point where the Demonata's and humanity\u2019s universe meet. Kernel is told that the universe used to look like a chess board, the white squares belonging to the demons and the Black belonging to the Old Creatures, with the sections being separated by the Kah-Gash. However the demons broke down the Kah-Gash and its soul split into three pieces. He also learns that the Kah-Gash will not destroy a universe, it will bring it back to its original state, thus wiping everything in our universe out. Having learnt this Kernel tries to escape, but \u201cArt\u201d is killed and another light sphere appears, who takes the form of Raz, another dead disciple. He tells Kernel that he has been chosen to be \"Noah\" and protect a vessel holding the best of each intelligent species in the universe. Kernel chooses to go back and help Grubbs and Bec beat \"The Shadow\" now revealed to be Death. However before Raz leaves he warns Kernel that Bec's piece of the Kah-Gash may have been corrupted by Lord Loss' possession of it (Bec\u2019s piece was stolen from Lord Loss in the fourth book of the series) and to beware of her. Kernel returns in the midst of a huge battle between the disciples (including Bec and Grubbs) and an army of the Demonata. He is initially frightened of Grubbs' newly wolfen form, but soon grows used to it. Everyone exchanges stories, but Kernel senses that Grubbs is hiding something. The band of fighters and mages decide to try to use the Kah-Gash against the oncoming hordes of demons. This plan is an amazing success and the three pieces of the Kah-Gash (Kernel, Bec and Grubbs) defeat the oncoming demons.\n\nBec and Grubbs begin arguing over whether or not to search for Beranabus' soul, and when Kernel thinks of Beranabus some lights begin to pulse - indicating that his soul can be found. Grubbs is still not happy about the idea, but when Bec reveals that Bill-E Spleen may also be there, Grubbs jumps at the opportunity to save his brother. Kernel begins opening a window, but also catches a glimpse of a world where Lord Loss is talking to millions of demons. He shrugs this off and continues to build the window which leads them to a world engulfed in shadow, which they then find out is death itself and that the windows led right into it's 'body'. The disciples realise that their magic does not work here, and that sound does not travel. However they discover that magic just works differently and that they can communicate telepathically thanks to Bec. Kernel can see differences in all the shadows, which then turn out to be the spirits of people, all of which seem to have gone insane, all screaming \"free me!\" Kernel then sends out a sort of sonar bleep and calls out to Beranabus, he follows Beranabus' \"voice\" and they talk about how to defeat Death, They are told by the ancient magician that it is impossible, Bec and Beranabus then have a private discussion, which makes Grubbs and Kernel wary of her. Beranabus tells them how to set the spirits free, thus unraveling death's physical form, but says that it will come back stronger. When Grubbs asks Kernel where Bill-E is and if Kernel could lead him to him, when Beranabus tells them quite flatly that it has taken all his effort for him not to go mad in Death and it is impossible for someone with such a weak mind to stay sane. Grubbs is extremly angered and upset with this and tells Kernel to tell him where Beranabus is so he can murder him again. Death then becomes aware of their precence inside it and begins to attack them, the heroes run to a side of death and begin to claw and attack it, death unravels and the spirits trapped inside quickly escape including Beranabus and whats left of Bill-E. The shadows disappear and the heroes fall into the world Kernel had seen before. They are surrounded by demons, with little hope of escape. Bec, Grubbs and Kernel join to form the Kah-Gash, and create a shield, however Grubbs refuses to give it more power as it would mean he was no longer in control of it. So they fight the demons. Kernel begins working on forming the window back to their universe, whilst being defended by Dervish. Meera Flame is fatally wounded but as her final act, kills herself and Juni Swan, who now has no hope of return as Death is incapacitated. Kernel opens the window and calls to everyone to follow, however Bec is in the clutches of Lord Loss and tells them to leave her.\n\nBefore they escape Kernel notices that Bec and the demon master are not fighting as violently as before, and suspects Bec of betrayal. When the remaining warriors return Dervish is in very bad shape, and asks to be taken outside to die. Kernel tells Grubbs he is returning to the ark. Grubbs says he understands and asks if Kernel would save the world \"regardless of the consequences\" Kernel agrees. Grubbs tells Kernel that he will hate him for what he is about to do, and then destroys Kernel's magically formed eyes and tells him that he needs him to stay. Kernel begins to warn Grubbs about Bec, but Grubbs has taken his uncle outside. The story ends with Kernel blind and alone, imagining Beranabus telling him that this is the end of the universe.","timestamp":"20090607114602","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Darren","comment":"Redirected page to [[Darren O'Shaughnessy]]","content":"#REDIRECT [[Darren O'Shaughnessy]]","timestamp":"20091007225935","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Darren_Shan","comment":"New page: '''Darren Shan''' (born [[July 2]], [[1972]] in [[London]], [[England]]) is the [[pen name]] of the [[Ireland|Irish]] [[author]] '''Darren O'Shaughnessy''', as well as the name of the [[pr...","content":"'''Darren Shan''' (born [[July 2]], [[1972]] in [[London]], [[England]]) is the [[pen name]] of the [[Ireland|Irish]] [[author]] '''Darren O'Shaughnessy''', as well as the name of the [[protagonist]] of his [[book series]] ''[[The Saga of Darren Shan]]''. This series is also known as ''The Cirque Du Freak Series'' in the [[United States]]. He also is currently writing [[The Demonata]] series, which has had good reception in several different countries as of late 2007. \n\n[[Universal Studios]] have bought the film rights to the first three books of ''The Saga'' and plan to combine them to make a single movie. If it is successful, they might make 4 movies in total, each film combining a trilogy of books from the series. [[Lauren Shuler Donner]] is producing the film, [[Paul Weitz]] is directing it, and the script has been written by [[Brian Helgeland]]. The movie will most likely be called ''Cirque Du Freak''.\n\n==Biography==\nDarren O'Shaughnessy was born on [[July 2]], [[1972]], in [[St Thomas' Hospital]], [[London]], [[England]]. He lives in Pallaskenry, County Limerick, in Ireland. At the age of three he started school at English Martyr's in London. When he was six, he moved, with his parents and younger brother, to [[Limerick]], [[Ireland]], were he has been living ever since. He received his [[primary education]] in [[Askeaton]], and went to [[High school|secondary school]] at Copsewood College in [[Pallaskenry]]. He then traveled back to London to study [[Sociology]] and [[English studies|English]] at [[Roehampton University]].\n\nDarren worked for a [[cable television]] company in Limerick for a few years and then decided to become a full-time writer. He bought his first [[typewriter]] when he was fourteen and wrote several short stories, comic scripts, and books that he never finished. His first success came to him at age fifteen, when he was a runner-up in a TV script-writing competition for [[Radio Telef\u00eds \u00c9ireann]] in Ireland, with a dark comedy story entitled ''A Day in the Morgue''. He finished his first novel at age seventeen. ''Mute Pursuit'' was never published, but Shan loved the writing experience, so he started focusing on novels more and not on short stories. \n\nAll of Shan's first books were oriented to adults. He thought writing children's books would be a nice idea for the future but adult books were his main focus. His first breakthrough was with his book, ''Ayuamarca'', written under his full name instead of his pen name. It was published in February [[1999]] by [[Orion Publishing Group]], and did not sell very well. The sequel, ''Hell's Horizon'', published in February [[2000]], was thought to be a better book, but it sold fewer copies than did the first.\n\nThen between the two adult books, Darren published his first children's book, ''[[Cirque Du Freak]]'', and it launched him into becoming a best selling author as he started ''[[The Saga of Darren Shan]]'' which he would finish twelve books and five years later. After ''The Saga'', he started his new series, ''The Demonata'' with six books already released and four more on the way.\n\nBy [[2007]], Shan's books were on sale on every continent, in 35 countries, and in 28 languages (36 and 29 if you include the illegally published versions on sale in Iran!). He has been a children's bestseller in the [[United States]], [[Great Britain]], [[Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], and other countries, and he has topped the adult bestsellers charts in [[Hungary]], [[Japan]], and [[Taiwan]]. His books have sold over 10 million copies worldwide.\n\nDarren has a collection of thousands of movies, and he also likes to collect original artwork. He enjoys reading books and comic books, taking long walks, watching football (he is a [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.]] and [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] fan), listening to [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music]], and traveling worldwide.\n\n==Bibliography==\n===''[[The Saga of Darren Shan]]''===\nThe series is comprised of 12 volumes:\n\nThe Cirque du Freak trilogy (''[[Vampire Blood]]'')<br>\n*1.

Though it is the second book in the series, it is a prequel to Lord Loss, the first book in the series. The protagonist is also different from that of the first book, a character called Kernel Fleck, who is the narrator of the book. Demon Thief takes place thirty years before Lord Loss so most of the characters from the first book did not appear, though a few did.\n\n== Plot ==\n\n'''Cornelius (Kernel) Fleck''' has never been normal. He has spent all of his life seeing strange glowing shapes floating through the air, which he could manipulate and join. One day, being particularly depressed he is playing with some shapes that are flashing, joining them together. He opens a window and something (later discovered to be Lord Loss) passes through before returning. Kernel follows it and disappears. A few days later Kernel returns with his baby brother, Art. However, Kernel doesn't remember anything of the past few days. When he gets back he has no recollection of what happened, and is clutching his brother. The parents are troubled by this and move.\n\nAfter a year in the new town he is confronted by the local supposed witch and discovers she too sees the floating lights. Later during school she attacks and explodes. A portal is created and cadaver (a demon) comes through followed by four 'disciples'. Cadaver kidnaps Art and retreats followed by the disciples and Kernel. Kernel learns that the disciples leader Beranabus is a magician and him Nadia, Sharmila and Raz are on a mission to find a piece of the Kah Gash (a weapon which could destroy the demon universe) and that Cadaver might know where it is. While chasing Cadaver the group arrive on a demon planet full of Kallin (demons) and engage in a gruesome battle in which Raz is killed. Cadaver sets a trap and Kernel and Nadia are forced to run away. Kernel opens up a window to a random city and Nadia takes that chance to run away from Beranabus. In order to get back to the demon universe he finds a nearly open window and meets Shark and Dervish outside a building where a punk concert is taking place.\n\nShark says that they are trying to stop a demon being summoned. Kernel helps them find the man that's summoning it, but is to late and the demon passes through the window. It causes terror and kills a few people, including the person who summoned it, but Dervish and Shark fight it back.\n\nKernel persuades them to go through the window with him. They do, and find themselves in a universe where they are standing on clouds. Kernel makes a portal to Beranabus and they go through.\n\nThey meet Beranabus, and he forces Kernel to make a window to Nadia. A few hours later, he comes back with Nadia and commands Kernel to take the window apart. Grudgingly, he does. Nadia swears to kill Beranabus, but he isn't very bothered. They continue to follow Cadaver until they reach the castle of Lord Loss. They enter to find Lord Loss with Cadaver, holding Art on his lap. Beranabus demands that Lord Loss turn over Cadaver to them. Loss agrees in exchange for a member of the group. Kernel thinks that the demon wants him because he can see the lights, however Loss chooses Nadia. He then causes her to explode, much to everyone's horror. Kernel, Dervish, and Shark then begin to argue for the release of Art.\n\nLord Loss pulls out an ancient chess board and says that their souls will be sealed inside it. Kernel will have three guesses to who the \"real thief (who stole Art)\" is. If he guesses correctly, everyone can go and Kernel can have his brother back. If not, they spent an eternity in the board. Inside the board, Kernel is unable to see anything. He realizes that he is on a black space and uses magic to cause the orange marbles he still has to light everything. He then manages to find a white space which has a lava river in it. He sees a demon that looks like a child and pursues it, however he is knocked into a river of molten lava by a winged demon. He is rescued, to his surprise, by Nadia. She tells him that when she exploded her soul was not in her body. She had seen ahead and asked Lord Loss privately to take her, since she hated working for Beranabus. Saving Kernel was her last act of help to him.\n\nAfter searching the board, Kernel finds both Dervish and Shark. He then uses the marbles to find Cadaver, who he believes is the thief. As he chases Cadaver down, he again sees the demon child. Finally catching Cadaver, he names him as a thief, which Lord Loss says is incorrect. Kernel then realizes that Cadaver was just a puppet and thinks that the real thief was Lord Loss, however that is also incorrect. With one chance left, Kernel again sees the demon child. Realizing that it's a clue, he finally knows who the real thief is: It's himself. When Kernel, Dervish, and Shark are released from the board, Lord Loss tells the group who the demon child is. Its name is Artery and it's one of his favorite familiars. When Kernel stepped through the portal at the beginning of the book, he was very lonely. He found Artery outside the castle, caught him, transformed him to look like a regular child, and shortened the name to Art. Since transformation magic was highly complex, Lord Loss decided to find out more about Kernel. Kernel's parents, who had lost a daughter when Kernel was four, decided to keep Art even though they knew he wasn't theirs. They moved to the village so that the people who lived in the city and were familiar with the family wouldn't find out about Art. Sharmila then asks if Kernel wants Art back. Lord Loss is willing to give Kernel Artery, who can easily be transformed back into a human, however warns them that Art will always be a demon on the inside and while he will never attack Kernel, he is certain to hurt others.\n\nKernel, heartbroken, decides to leave Artery and go home. However, upon arriving home, things were even worse. Seven years passed since his departure and his parents had gotten used to the loss of their children. Kernel realized that they could never truly accept him back, so he travels back to Beranabus.\n\nKernel then shows Beranbus how, when chttp:\/\/darrenshan.wikia.com\/index.php?title=Demon_Thief&action=edit&section=&preload=&editintro=oncentrating on making portals to anything that's with them, the lights don't pulse. For anything that's not with them, the lights pulse. When concentrating on the promised piece of the weapon, the lights don't pulse, and Kernel concludes that the piece of the Kah Gash must be him.\n\n== Tag Lines ==\n\n*''Go to hell''\n*''It's in the blood''\n\n== Time ==\n\nThe story is set in the 1970s. Evidence suggesting this is the fact that at a rock concert during the story, Dervish Grady (as a punk) clearly says \"It's the new movement\". It was during this movement the Sex Pistols came into the public eye and that Kernel mentions packing up his records when moving to a new house.","timestamp":"20080209215010","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Demonata","comment":"Created page with '{{Infobox Species | name             = {{PAGENAME}} | image            = [[File:DemonataHorde.jpg]] | skin             = Multiple<br>Sometimes none | hair             =  | univer\u2026'","content":"{{Infobox Species\n| name             = {{PAGENAME}}\n| image            = [[File:DemonataHorde.jpg]]\n| skin             = Multiple<br>Sometimes none\n| hair             = \n| universe         = [[Demonata universe]]\n| bookuniverse     = [[The Demonata]]\n| book appearance  = {{Dx01}}\n| movie appearance =\n}}\n\n:''For the book series, see [[The Demonata]]''\nThe '''{{PAGENAME}}''' are demons who have no feeling or emotions and can kill humans or even eachother without regret.

At first, Beranabus was reluctant but later he just let them go on and do what they want, keeping in touch with only a few of his Disciples at a time. Their main job was to stop crossings into the human universe but a select few traveled around with Beranabus in the Demonata's universe to try and find the legendary universe destroyer, the [[Kah-Gash]]. \n\n===[[Slawter (book)]]===\n\n===[[Bec (book)]]===\nWith the help of humans and other intelligent beings, they moved onto planets in the [[Human universe|other universe]] and killed just for fun. Later, when the humans needed to keep their numbers up, they mated with the Demonata and hence, the [[Grady curse]] was made.\n\n===[[Blood Beast]]===\nFor the entire chapters there are no demons except in the end of the chapters.\n\n===[[Demon Apocalypse]]===\n\n===[[Death's Shadow]]===\n\n===[[Wolf Island (book)]]===\n\n===[[Dark Calling]]===\n''Dark Calling'' reveals that both the Old Creatures and the [[Demonata]] are creatures of the original universe which preceded the two universes in the series. This universe was structured like a [[chessboard]]; it consisted of sixty-four squares, half of them [[White and Black in chess]] and half of them [[White and Black in chess|black]], each square containing infinite space within. The Demonata inhabited the white squares, the Old Creatures the black; the different zones were kept separate by a force which the Old Creatures called the Kah-Gash. While the Demonata were capable of reproduction, the Old Creatures were sterile, but this did not bother them; since time did not exist in the original universe, everything therein was ageless and immortal. They can still get killed.  \n\nOriginally, the peaceful Old Creatures contented themselves with exploring their realms, undisturbed. The Old Creatures and the Demonata were unaware of each other, and it is stated that they were never intended to mix. However, out of curiosity, the demons eventually crossed into the black zones, discovered the Old Creatures, and attempted to wipe them out. At first the Old Creatures fled, hoping in their innocence that the demons would lose interest and leave them alone. When it became clear that this would not happen, the Old Creatures were forced to engage the demons in open war.\n\nAs the conflict escalated, pressure was put on the Kah-Gash, and it ultimately fractured under the strain. When this happened, the entire universe collapsed into a single speck, [[explosion|exploding]] a split-second later in what came to be called the [[Big Bang]]. The explosion formed two new universes: one (this universe) for the Old Creatures and ultimately the numerous species which developed on various planets; the other for the Demonata. The Kah-Gash split into three pieces, which for the next several billion years moved between the two universes inhabiting various life forms. Its last act was to create structures separating the universes, so that the two groups would never come into conflict again.\n\nFollowing the explosion, time came into existence; everything in both universes began to age, and therefore became mortal. \n\n=== [[Hell's Heroes]] ===\nAfter the Kah-Gash had been unleashed and the universes were both destroyed, [[Grubbs Grady]], [[Bec McConn]] and [[Kernel Fleck]] traveled to the Crux to finish off the Demon Masters for good. There, they wiped out the entire population of Demon Masters except for [[Lord Loss (character)|Lord Loss]] as Bec had struck a deal with him to keep him alive. Hence, all Demon Masters had been killed meaning very limited or no crossing in future after the universe had been recreated.\n\n==Appearances==\nThe Demonata are an unimaginative race. They just steal their shapes off of other creatures from the human universe. Some, however, just take on random forms that no one can name. Some Demonata are also so big, they can be mistaken for stars.\n\n==Personality==\nThe Demonata are mostly cruel and only want to kill. However only such as Lord Loss, that feed on misery and suffering of humans. Most just want to kill and eat their prey. \n\nIn Death's Shadow they hated the Old Creatures but they had a lot of respect for them.\n\n==Ranks==\nDemonata can be split into ranks from weak to strong.\n\n=== 1st tier Demonata (The [[Fomorii]]) ===\nThe Fomorii are what the ancient people of Ireland thought were the worst of all demons, as evidenced in ''[[Bec (book)|Bec]]''. They fought them usually during the night. However the Fomorii were mostly weaker demons, and would often merge their bodies with those of the human dead and animals before fighting others. They are named after a race of demonic creatures from Irish legend.\n\n=== 2nd tier Demonata ===\nSome are the size of stars, and some are only a few feet long.  All of them are deadly, however. They tend to have animal qualities. Many serve other higher demons but care not for the lower demons. Lots of 2nd tier demons tend to dwell inside their own universes with demons of a similar type. Such examples of 2nd tier demons in the book would be [[Vein]], [[Artery]] or [[Gregor]].\n\n===[[Demon Master]]===\nDemon Masters are the most powerful Demonata of them all. They are so strong that they can kill even the most powerful of mages easily. Each Demon Master usually creates their own realm in the Demonata universe to live in, sometimes with their familiars. Some Demon Masters can also lay dormant until requirements are fulfilled, such as sacrifices.\n\n== List of Demonata == \n'''+''' means that the demon has died\n===Leader===\n*[[Death]]\n\n===Demon Masters===\n*[[Lord Loss (character)|Lord Loss]]\n*Living lake demon '''+'''\n*Demon with multiple eyes, and claws with Burning mucus '''+'''\n*A leech like demon with one eye '''+'''\n*Demon with multiple eyes and bulges, looks like nothing on earth.

There is at least one demon in every book.\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe demons seen thus far in the series are all hideously deformed creatures. Most of them are a combination of creatures from our world, such as Vein, who is a combination of a dog, a crocodile, and a female human. They are a combination of magic and of age. Also, many have special abilities to kill their prey, such as spitting acid. They range in size from about a foot tall to the size of planets (see below). The entity [[Satan]], if indeed he exists in the universe of The Demonata has yet to be revealed.\n\n== Types of Demons ==\n\nThere appears to be a sort of [[class system]] among demons in the Demonata universe.

They control entire worlds created by themselves where they envelop their own rules of both time and space. They are guarded by their own demons (referred to as 'familiars') however powerful or vile they tend to be. The main Demon Master featured in the book series is Lord Loss, a demon who feasts not on humans, but on their pain and suffering. Lord Loss also has the power to reverse the effects of lycanthropy.\n\n=== The Old Creatures ===\nIt is not determined what the Old Creatures are - if they are demons or some other form of magical being. It is believed that they are not demons, but they are known to have been alive since the start of such known creatures. They are said to be the Creators, assumed to be the creators of the multiverse. It is also mentioned that they could possibly be the result of a higher more technically advanced society that evolved to such beings of high exhaltation. In the book Bec, it is said that they are dying out and moving on from [[Earth]].\n\n== Worlds ==\n\nThere are thousands of demon worlds.  They can be created by Demon Masters, but most demons just flip through existing worlds.  In each world, time works differently.  For example, one could spend a day in [[Lord Loss (character)|Lord Loss]]'s world while years pass on Earth. Likewise, one could spend a month in a world and come back an hour after you left.  \n\nMost other natural laws work differently as well. Magic is much stronger in the Demonata Universe, so magicians and mages can draw it in and do lots of spells they would be unable to do on Earth universe. Also, many of the demonata's worlds defy the laws of physics. For example, one race of demons lives on a pinnacle of rock that may be suspended in space, or may be balancing on the ground.  Either way, it would be impossible on Earth. In one other world, it is possible to stand on the clouds; in another it is possible to [[walk on water]].\n\n== List of Demons ==\nBelow is a list of named or featured demons in the series so far.\n\n===[[The Kallin]]===\n*Description ; long, black haired, spider like creatures but they have no limbs (legs, arms) .

Mr Tiny makes his appearance in the [[The Vampire's Assistant|second]],[[The Vampire Prince|sixth]], seventh, tenth, eleventh, and final book of the Darren Shan series,and we find that he is the master of strange creatures called the [[Little People]] who work at the Cirque du Freak. Later on, we find out that the Little People are creations of Mr. Tiny using the souls and body parts of the dead. We also find that Mr. Tiny controls and looks after [[destiny]] as well as [[predicts]] it. Yet, it is said by his daughter [[Evanna]] that he can not influence the future without releasing trapped horrors of the world. This could possibly refer to the [[Demonata]]. \n\nMr. Tiny is described as very short and he wears wellies. He also carries a heart shaped watch. During the series we find that Mr. Tiny enjoys watching and causing suffering to all. He is also responsible for the [[prophecy|prophecies]] made for the [[Vampires]] and the [[Vampaneze]] (and perhaps the humans but this is never mentioned).

He also gave the [[vampires]] the [[stone of blood]] and the [[vampaneze]] the [[coffin of fire]] and tried to make the [[Lord of Shadows]] come alive. Mr. Tiny interferes in the world's goings-on to adhere to his own purposes, and many people have come to power because of his work. His goal is for complete destruction, although he calls it 'art and beauty'. He has an interest in the arts, and takes it from wherever he can, even claiming to own the original Mona Lisa (it is said the one in Paris was a fake).

He is the protagonist of the first book, Lord Loss, the third, Slawter, the fifth, Blood Beast, and the sixth book, of which the title has not yet been announced. In Blood Beast Grubbs is afflicted by Lycanthropy.\n\nLike his Uncle Dervish he also has a cruel taste in pranks.\n\n\n\n= Family =\n\nGrubbs is the son of Cal and Sharon Grady.He has two siblings; his sister Gret and his half brother Bill-E Spleen. He is the nephew of Dervish Grady, Mike and Rosetta (Sharon's brother and his wife). He has three cousins Conor, Lisa and Laura.\n\nThe Garadex (or Grady, as they are currently known) family has a curse placed upon it. At any time in their teenage years, a Grady child can turn into a werewolf. In the time of Grubbs,the curse's origins are unknown. It is later revealed in the fourth book of the series Bec that many years before, when the demons invaded, their clan, The MacGrigors, had bred with lesser demons, thus creating a lycanthropy gene that could appear in any member of the clan. Bec was part of this clan, so it is possible that she is very distantly related to Grubbs.\n\n= Biography =\n\n== Lord Loss ==\n\nGrubbs Grady grew up in Ireland (most likely County Clare, although not confirmed). He lives in a house where the playing of chess is enforced strictly by both of his parents.\n\nWhen he hears his parents and sister talking behind his back and treating him differently, Grubbs gets suspicious that something is going on. One day, his parents bought ballet recital tickets and Grubbs didn't want to go so he went to spend a night with his aunt. Grubbs sneaks back to his house and sees his murdered parents and sister as well as the demon Lord Loss (character) and his minions, Artery and Vein. After fighting the demons, Grubbs is traumatized by this event, and is admitted to a mental hospital. The doctors try to calm him and convince Grubbs that what he saw was a hallucination, but Grubbs will not believe them. After a few months, his Uncle Dervish visits him at the institute and tells him that what he saw was real, and that he can explain to him the truth of it all.\n\nGrubbs then, after being given permission to visit realtives, moves in with his Uncle in Carcery Vale, where he befriends a child in his new town called Bill-E who often spends time with Dervish. Bill-E thinks that he is actually Dervish's son and Grubbs' cousin.\n\nGrubbs and Bill-E tour the house together and the come to a hall full of paintings, of dead family members. Grubbs and Bill-E are suspicious that there are a large number of children and young adult paintings and Bill-E tells Grubbs of his suspiscions.\n\nAfter looking through books and noting Dervish's behavior, Bill-E and Grubbs start suspecting that Dervish is a werewolf, but when the two of them follow him into the woods, Grubbs soon discovers that Bill-E is the actual werewolf. Grubbs alsio finds out that Bill-E is his brother. Dervish explains to Grubbs about their family past and how they have always had the lycanthropy curse (where family members turned in to werewolves). Dervish also reveals the nature of Lord Loss and explains that he is a Demon Master who has the power to reverse the curse. Most Demon Masters are violent and brutal just like other Demons. But Lord Loss is different, because he feeds off the suffering of people and enjoys playing chess. Dervish continues to explain that hundreds of years before a family ancestor, known as Bartholomew Garadex, bargained with Lord Loss and in return for teaching Lord Loss chess he would cure a family member. After a time lord Loss grew inpatient because Bartholomew would only play when he wanted a family member cured. After Bartholomew died if a family member needed curing then two members of the family would be chosen to face Lord Loss at a midway point between the human universe and Lord Losses universe. One would fight Lord Loss's familiars and the other would face Lord Loss in the best of five simultaneous games of chess. If they could win three of the games, the curse would be reversed, but the one who faced Lord Loss in chess would fight him alone in the Demonata's universe. If they lost the chess match or the fight with the familiars, then they would be killed. Grubbs and Dervish go to fight Lord Loss in the chess match. Before they go to fight, Dervish confides to Grubbs that Bill-E is not Grubbs' cousin, but is actually his brother.\n\nThe battle against Lord Loss starts with playing chess with Dervish and Grubbs was fighting the familiers, where he discovers that he can harness some of his magical powers in the demon world. Half way through, Grubbs is struggling and due to Lord Loss's fondness of Grubbs he decides to bend the rules this once and allows Grubbs to swap places with Dervish.\n\nAt the start, Lord Loss beats Grubbs easily. But once Grubbs realizes that Lord Loss feeds off his discomfort, he loosens up, heckles him and easily beats Lord Loss. Bill-E is cured and Dervish must return to the demon universe to fight Lord Loss single handedly.\n\nDervish's body continues to function in the normal universe but with no discernable personality, while his soul and mind is fighting in the Demon universe. When Bill-E comes to, Grubbs lies to Bill-E and tells him that they actually are cousins, and that Dervish has been cured of his werewolf curse but he was forced to cast a calming spell on Dervish as to account for his trancelike state. After many months, Grubbs wakes up to find blood-red stains lining the outside of his cheeks, and dirt and hairs under his nails. He had been warned by Dervish before he stepped into Lord Loss's realm that he could change into a werewolf at any given time. Grubbs thinks twice about calling the Lambs, the 'family executioners' who kill people\/werewolves with the curse, but his troubles are put aside when Dervish's voice sounds from the corner. Grubbs turns and sees his uncle holding a woolen scarf, ripped into tatters, a tin of red paint and a pot of soil, grinning at him and apparently well and unharmed.\n\n== Slawter ==\n\nSlawter is set about a year after Lord Loss takes place. When the story takes place Dervish, who has just returned from his battle with Lord Loss, is having mental problems. He has terrible nightmares and he attacks Grubbs in his sleep.\n\nA horror movie producer named Davida Haym offers Dervish a chance to work on the set of her new movie, \"Slawter\". \"Slawter\" is about demons. He quickly accepts the job thinking that it will be a good chance to help restore his sanity. Grubbs soon finds out that Davida has made a deal with Lord Loss that if she gets Dervish and Grubbs to work on the movie, she can film them live giving her the movie of her life. But when Dervish, Grubbs, Bill-E and a psychologist named Juni Swan try to escape, they encounter a barrier which sends them into a dream world. In this dream world, Bill-E has been captured by the Lambs so they can learn the secrets of how his Lycanthropy was cured.\n\nDervish, along with Shark and Sharmila (both in Demon Thief) invade the Lambs complex and demand the return of Bill-E Spleen. The Lambs refuse so they invade the complex and rescue Bill-E. Grubbs then realises too many convenient facts, including Shark happening to see the blueprints, the fact that they could use such powerful magic when no windows to the Demonata's universe were open, and the fact that the complex was an exact replica of Hannibal Lecter's cell.\n\nHe wakes up and finds himself in a small room in one of buildings that make up the town Slawter. Dervish and Bill-E are also in the room with him and he uses magic to wake them up. Juni is not with them and they presume her to be dead. The three of them then run into the town trying to warn people to get away by saying there is a gas leak and the town will explode soon.\n\nNo one heeds their warnings and Davida sets the Demons upon the unwilling cast and crew, but Lord Loss then betrays her and kills her. Most of the actors fight back - thinking this is a plot change - but soon realise its not and are killed. The three of them run and try to lure a demon closer to the invisible force field that surrounds the town so they can blow it up, making a hole in the wall and allowing them to escape. To do this they leave a sheepish Bill-E in an alley to attract a weak demon.\n\nFinally, one does come, after a girl named Bo Kooniart (who they previously disliked and whose father was in on Davida Haym's plot), a girl called Karin and three boys see them and run to them while being chased by a giant bee-like demon. Dervish and Grubbs subdue it but suddenly Juni reappears and kills it. To get another, Grubbs, Bo and Karin all lure a demon into chasing them, but are unlucky when Lord Loss finds them. Artery and a new cockroach-demon called Gregor are with him and the children run. Karin is soon killed off by Lord Loss's literal kiss of death, causing Grubbs and Bo to weep for her, which makes Lord Loss stronger. They eventually find the edge but Dervish is not there. Suddenly Dervish and Juni appear from under an invisibility shield and distract Lord Loss so Grubbs can move Gregor to the barrier. Juni is about to kill the demon before she is struck by Gregor's leg.\n\nGrubbs manages to open a window by killing Gregor but has to battle Lord Loss and Artery. Dervish attacks Lord Loss with the people he helped get through. Bill-E pulls a merely unconscious Juni through.\u2192 Grubbs then sees that Demons can get through so the creates another hole that only humans can get through. Grubbs then has to battle multiple demons to buy time for the people here. He realises he has power that he never knew he had, even the power to injure Lord Loss so Dervish can get out. Grubbs then runs out after Dervish and the window closes. An unlucky few are still trapped inside and Lord Loss then slaughters them brutally. He promises to get his revenge on Dervish, Grubbs and Bill-E (similar to the geis he puts on the warriors in Bec. They realise that Bo did not make it out of the bubble surrounding Slawter as she went to try and save her father. They then see Davida's assistant director Chuda sitting there and Grubbs almost kills him but Bill-E stops him. Then Juni kills him with magic she never knew she had until fighting in the bubble. Later, they find that Juni has gone, and left a note saying that she had to be alone for a while after what she had done, and didn't want to be contacted.\n\nBack at Dervish's house, Dervish tells Grubbs about what his future would be if he did have magic. This causes Grubbs subconscious to hide his magic, even though Dervish said it was impossible. When Dervish scans Grubbs for magic powers he thinks he has none, but in truth, Grubbs had hid them without knowing. Later he decides to check if he did have powers, and managed to switch the light on and off without using the switch and make his reflection disappear. To have the power to conceal his powers from Dervish and to use magic in the real world away from any demons can only mean one thing - Grubbs is a magician.\n\n== Blood Beast ==\n\nBlood Beast is set about a year after Slawter. It begins back Dervish's house where Grubbs begins to feel alarming symptoms in connection with the full moon. He is having dreadful nightmares full of Demons and his sister Gret who keeps coming close to killing him. Also in these dreams he has changed to a werewolf. However, Grubbs attempts to convince himself that these nightmares are only normal. On top of this, his magicians prowess is growing all the time. He makes water change direction as it goes down the plughole (defying gravity) and claims to have woken from his nightmares levitating\n\nGrubbs has got back to life as usual, and has got a crowd of friends, including a new best friend, Loch Gossel, who constantly bullies Grubbs half brother, Bill-E. At school there is a certain girl he likes called Reni Gossel, the sister of Loch. After Dervish has to go away for the weekend to say goodbye to Meera Flame, Grubbs throws a big house party. Reni, Loch, Bill-E and a few more stay the night. They play spin the bottle and Grubbs kisses with Reni for the first time. He is so excited by this, he accidentally uses his magic powers. The bottle starts levitating and then explodes. He freezes the bottle in time and turns the shattered glass into Butterflies and flower petals. Half way through the night, Grubbs wakes up to a howling noise. He finds himself in the bathroom. He then realises the growling is coming from him. He looks in the mirror to find that he has become a werewolf, but somehow he changes himself back to normal.\n\nThe next morning, Bill-E and Loch decide to go and look for Lord Sheftree's treasure, but Grubbs isn't feeling well and protests greatly, but eventually gives in. The three set about digging and just as Loch is about to go home, they find a spot that Grubbs remembers Dervish at before. They start digging, but there are big rocks in the way which are hard to move. The boys go home but make a pact to come back after school every day until they find the treasure. Dervish returns home, but was drunk the previous night and fell into a deep sleep, so Grubbs couldn't tell him about the nightmares and fear of lycanthropy.\n\nGrubbs goes to sleep, but later wakes up and finds himself at the hole moving the heavy rocks, by himself. He runs back to the house and goes back to sleep. When Bill-E and Loch see the hole the next day, they are amazed and believe that Lord Sheftree planted bombs to kill those that tried to get his treasure, but the simply were old and detonated late. As they are digging, they begin to get very angry at each other and bicker, even try to kill each other. Grubbs feels magic in the air, and feels that it may be affecting the three, but tells the other two that it must be chemicals in the soil.\n\nLoch and Grubbs climb out of the hole and start to talk to each when they hear a scream. The floor has given way and Bill-E is hanging on for his life. They hoist him up, and look down. The rocks gave way to a deep tube, but one that might be able to climb down. After a debate, the three decide to go down. At the bottom, they find a cave full of stalactites and stalagmites with a large water fall. They start looking for the treasure but find none.\n\nBill-E and Loch decide to climb a wall of the cave. At this point, Grubbs begins to feel very ill (possibly because of the full moon) and looks to the floor of the cavern. He see's a girls face in the rock similar to his sister's[1] whispering in a strange language, but then she suddenly goes silent. Grubbs hears a scream from behind him and a thud. He turns around to find Loch's lifless body lying on the floor, blood seeping out of his head. Grubbs attempts to heal the wounds while Bill-E leaves to get help. While Bill-E is gone, Grubbs needs to resuscitate Loch several times. The first two times it works, but then on the third, Loch stops breathing, his heart stops beating, and he dies. The whispering starts again and Grubbs starts to freak out. When he calms down he looks at Loch, and lifts up his head and notices something odd - all the blood is gone.\n\nEventually Dervish and Bill-E turn up at the cave, however there is nothing that can be done to save Loch's life and Grubbs soon realises that there is no ambulance. Dervish says that they cannot let an ambulance come to the cave. The boys protest, but he says that he will explain to them later. The three of them move the body of Loch to a nearby quarry and throw it over a cliff edge.\n\nDervish explains later the Grubbs why this is necessary - the cave is one where demons can create a strong doorway into the human world (presumably the same cave from Bec). Dervish has been given the duty to protect the cave and make sure nobody else can unleash the Demonata. Although hard to accept at first, Grubbs and Bill-E play along after being investigated by the police.\n\nOne week later Grubbs returns to school. The psychologist has left the school, and a new one has come as a replacement. Grubbs is sent to meet her and finds out it is Juni Swan, a psychologist that Grubbs and Dervish met on the set of Slawter. Juni helps Grubbs, Bill-E, and their friends to cope with Loch's death, and soon everyone seems to be dealing fine. However tensions increase as Juni meets up with Dervish and both become romantically involved, eventually moving in with Dervish.Juni tells Grubbs and Dervish that since Slawter, her magic has advanced tremendously. This encourages Dervish, and he teaches her more spells and continues to see her more and more.\n\nIn the following days Grubbs becomes more aware of the impending doom of his curse. Not only that, but he begins to notice a tramp coincidentally appearing around Carcery Vale. The tramp has an appearance nearly identical to Beranabus from Demon Thief, and may in fact be him. This is supported by the fact that Dervish attempts to contact Beranabus slightly before the tramp appears. On one of his late night jogs, Grubbs notices the tramp near by the cave, the tramp tells him, \"It won't be long.\" This immediately leads to Grubbs suspicion that Dervish called the Lambs. Grubbs gets Juni to ask Dervish about this for him, and she claims that Dervish did call them, but also goes on to tell him that she'll do whatever it takes to stop Grubbs from being killed, and that she sees him as her own son. It is not known whether Dervish did actually call the Lambs or if the people Grubbs attacks while escaping the cellar are actually Lambs, as Juni may very likely have lied to Grubbs about Dervish's call.\n\nFor several nights around the time of the full moon, Grubbs has what he describes as a battle between his human and werewolf sides. During these times, he is in extreme pain while Juni and Dervish need to hold him down. Grubbs suggests that they put him in a cage that Dervish owns for the next night. During that evening, while in the cage, Juni suggests that Dervish leaves while she performs a dangerous spell to help Grubbs. Once Dervish is gone, she frees Grubbs from the cage, then passionately kisses him when he shows his desire to die at the hands of the lambs, claiming that she will not let him be killed while there may be hope. She says that they should go to meet up at the cave. he then breaks out of the cage, and battles 3 of what he believes are Lambs, dispatching them easily.\n\nGrubbs runs to the cave, where he loses control again and turns into a werewolf. When he returns to his normal state, Grubbs finds that he has killed Ma & Pa Spleen, Bill-E's grandparents and legal guardians. Not wanting to kill again, Juni says that the two of them need to run away from Dervish and the Lambs to protect Grubbs, both from his own death and the deaths of others.\n\nThe two of them go to an airport, and board a plane, all of which is very distant to Grubbs. He falls asleep while on the plane. When he awakes, the plane is shaking, apparently due to turbulence. However, soon the cockpit opens and demons appear on the plane, Artery first and then the scorpion like creature from the front of the book. They both begin killing the passengers on the plane along with another rabbit-like demon. Finally, Lord Loss appears in the plane, stunning the passengers. Juni appears next to him and reveals that she summoned him and is actually a familiar of Lord Loss. The book ends with her declaring, \"He's all yours, master.\" The book then on a to be continued, with the words \"What the hell's coming next?\" underneath the title Book Six...\n\n== Book 6 ==\n\nGrubbs will appear in book 6, along with Juni and [[Lord Loss]].\n\n= Powers =\n\nGrubbs Grady is a practicing mage. He has large amounts of power at his fingertips, even when demons are not around. He was even able to hide his magic when Dervish probed into his brain, something that is supposed to be impossible. The exact extent of his powers is unknown, but he was able to severely hinder Lord Loss in Slawter while Dervish couldn't even cause Lord Loss to flinch. Dervish believed he might be a magician like Beranabus or Bartholomew, but he found no evidence of this.\n\nSome people have magic with in them, however it usually remains dormant unless the person sees something magical like a Demon attack, or uses magic in an area with lots of magic in it and they become aware that they have powers. From this the Disciples, (others that have become aware of their powers and answer to a magician known as Beranabus), can contact the person that has become aware and attempt to recruit them in to the ranks of the other Disciples to travel around the world and stop demons from passing into our universe. Some people choose not to get involved and some do.\n\nMost of the disciples have very limited powers unless in the presence of the Demons or in the Demon universe. However, Grubbs managed to disable large security flood lights and turn concrete blocks to mud like sludge so they can be scooped out of a wall. There were demons there inside D workshop in the Book Slawter so he might have been able to tap into the demons magic at that time. He does a few spells that are average in power but near the end creates a barrier that demons cannot pass, something which Dervish could not do. At first Grubbs believes he was only able to use magic in the presence of demons but at the end of Slawter he tests his powers, where he is not in the presence of demons and finds that he can make his reflection disappear and change light. Only a few people can use magic outside of the demon universe, and to be able to do it without training means that Grubbs is extremely powerful and may be a magician like Beranabus.\n\nHe has shown great cunning, emphasized in his chess match with Lord Loss. When he realized that the demon master was feeding off of his disappointment in losing pieces, he put on a happy facade and defeats him. Although he wasn't as good at chess as Lord Loss; he confused Lord Loss which caused him to make mistakes.\n\nHe also has the powers to fight off his own wolfen gene, which no other Grady has done before and is able to be in a state of knowing what he is doing when he turns into a wolf. He can also turn glass into flowers and butterflys.\n\nDue to this potentially immense power, it is has been speculated that, like Kernel Fleck, Grubbs is part of the Kah-Gash without Beranabus knowing, but this has not been confirmed","timestamp":"20070909153548","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Grubs_Grady","comment":"[[Grubs Grady]] moved to [[Grubbs Grady]]: spelling incorection","content":"#REDIRECT [[Grubbs Grady]]","timestamp":"20071226005041","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Grubsitch_Grady","comment":"Redirect","content":"#REDIRECT [[Grubs Grady]]","timestamp":"20071225101631","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Guardians_Of_The_Blood","comment":"The Guardians of the Blood are regular humans who live inside Vampire Mountain.

He can make windows out of these patches. However, when he mentioned it to his parents and teachers, he was assumed to be crazy and consequently ignored. As a result, Kernel had no friends and was lonely throughout his childhood.\n\nAs Kernel lay restlessly in bed one night, he began to arrange the patches of light without knowing he was slowly assembling a window into the realm of the dreaded Lord Loss, a demon master. As the window formed, he was lured through it. After being brought into the demon master's universe, Kernel successfully transformed one of Lord Loss' demon servants, Artery, into a human child, which he named Art. When he returned, he could not remember any of the trip, but, despite his parents' mystification, they accepted the new baby as his younger \"brother\". Art is the reason Kernel goes in to Demonata - the universe of demons.\n\nKernel's parents, disturbed by the coming of Art, moved into a village to start a new life. A year later, an old woman there summoned the demon Cadaver into the universe of humans, who slaughtered dozens of schoolchildren and stole Art from Kernel. Kernel joined \"The Disciples\" who were pursuing Cadaver, to try to get back his brother. After a long pursuit they went into the realm of Lord Loss again, and it was found that Lord Loss had ordered Cadaver to steal Art back from Kernel. After another long struggle, in the chess board of Lord Loss, Kernel found that he himself was the \"Demon Thief\" (i.e. the thief who stole the demon).\n\n===After Book 2===\n\nAt the end of the book Kernel realised that he is a piece of the weapon, 'Kah-Gash', which can destroy universes, and shared his insight with Beranabus, the leader of \"The Disciples\". In [[Demon Apocalypse]] it is revealed that Grubbs, Kernel and Bec are all parts of the [[Kah-Gash]].","timestamp":"20071013151125","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Kernel_Fleck?","comment":"[[Kernel Fleck?]] moved to [[Beranabus's father]]","content":"#REDIRECT [[Beranabus's father]]","timestamp":"20080515183328","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Kik_Kane","comment":"Created page with '{{Infobox Character | name             = {{PAGENAME}} | image            =  | profession       = Actor | gender           = Female | species          = Human | age              =\u2026'","content":"{{Infobox Character\n| name             = {{PAGENAME}}\n| image            = \n| profession       = Actor\n| gender           = Female\n| species          = Human\n| age              =\n| relatives        = [[Kuk Kane]] (Brother)\n| status           = Deceased\n| universe         = [[Demonata (series)|The Demonata series]]\n| book appearance  = {{Dx03}}\n| movie character  = \n| movie appearance =\n| acted by         =\n}}\n\n\nKuk's female twin sister. \n\n==The Demonata==\n===[[Slawter (book)|Slawter]]===\nGrubbs think she is also strange as her twin brother.

It reveals a lot about the character of Harkat Mulds mainly and introduces a new character called Spits Abrams. This book also adds many more questions that will be answered in the next two books. Also, this book is the longest in the series.\n\n\n[edit] Plot\nThe Lake of Souls takes place right after Killers of the Dawn, with Mr. Crepsley dead and Steve's revelation that he is the Lord of the Vampaneze. Darren is unable to cry. He feels numb, but with the help of the bearded lady, Truska, he eventually does so. Mr. Tiny then appears and tells Harkat that if he wants his nightmares (which have returned) to stop, he must walk through a portal that Mr. Tiny makes. Harkat refuses to let Darren go with him. Debbie Hemlock and Police Chief Alice Burgess want to start an army to combat the vampets, but have to get the approval of the vampire princes first, so they are only mentioned briefly. Darren later decides that he should go with Harkat, much to Harkat's dismay. Darren and Harkat then walk through the mysterious portal, and are thrown into a strange, gray world.\n\nDarren and Harkat are forced to complete many diffucult tasks. They first hunt down a black panther and collect a map inside it. Darren finds that the panther's teeth have been marked with letters. They start rearranging the teeth, with Harkat using up all the teeth to get SLAM DARK HUT, and then again to find it reads HARKAT MULDS. Harkat dismisses it as an utter waste of time, as Mr. Tiny loves to meddle with time. Harkat keeps the teeth, saying that they might be useful as they are sharp.\n\nNext they have to steal 'gelatinous globes' from the world's biggest toad. They arrive to see the toad standing in the middle of a lake surrounded by crocodiles. Darren and Harkat zip through the lake, grab a few globes, then run off.\n\nDarren and Harkat eventually meet up with Lady Evanna. Her appearance is completely unexpected, and she does not wish to tell the two how or why she is there. She helps them get across the lake where they meet a man who calls himself Spits Abrams. Spits is a former pirate and heavy drinker, and although Darren and Harkat do not trust him very much, they decide that Mr. Tiny put him in that world for a reason, and decide to take him with them.\n\nThey soon reach a small area filled with 'people' called Kulashkas. They are required to steal vials of 'holy liquid'. Darren and Harkat enter the village, Spits being afraid, to find the 'holy liquid' to be the venom from the fangs of a huge creature called the Grotesque. The Grotesque is apparently the Kulashkas' god. Darren and Harkat rush to two vials containing the venom and are attacked by the Grotesque.\n\nHarkat raises the vial as the Grotesque attempts to kill him, and the Grotesque backs off. The Kulashkas arrive, pointing spears at Darren and Harkat, trying to drive them back. They are driven closer to the Grotesque and Darren drives them back with his vial. The chief of the Kulashkas starts trying to speak to them in a non-understandable language, with Darren saying that he can't understand them. The chief starts gesturing that they are free to leave, but must return the vials to the altar which carried them. Darren starts to do so, but a drunken Spits arrives, throwing one vial at the Grotesque, which explodes, hurting the Grotesque and those nearby it, revealing the liquid to be highly explosive. Harkat sees floorboards underneath them and starts stomping on them. Darren joins in, with Spits saying, \"What in the devil's name are ye...\" before crashing through the floorboards.\n\nThey end up in a tunnel, following it until they reach a room. There is a fridge, which Spits asks about, as he did not have fridges in his time. There are also postcards, signed by Mr. Tiny. Harkat is bothered by the postcards, but does not explain why. They then leave the room, Spits taking a few extra bottles of whiskey.\n\nThey soon reach the Lake. It is seen to be covered with dragons and Darren and Harkat figure out that they should make bombs, filling the 'gelatinous globes' with the Grotesque venom and throwing it at the dragons. They finally get up close to the Lake and Spits says that when Mr. Tiny brought him here, he told him that there was a spell on the Lake forbidding dragons to be closer than eight metres to the Lake unless a living person fell into the Lake. Then Spits quotes on how many people are in the Lake of Souls. He starts talking about how the crew on the Prince o' Pariah, the ship he used to serve, loved his meals, revealing that he is a cannibal. Spits says that he plans to stay by the Lake of Souls, feeding of the people who lived there. He is persistently told not to feed on the souls and is accidentally knocked away from the eight metre zone. A dragon soon breathes fire at him and he is seen burning, running around not able to see, and then falls into the lake, breaking the spell.\n\nWhile being ruthlessly attacked by a dragon, Harkat pulls up his former identity, revealed to be Kurda Smahlt. The world freezes and Mr. Tiny appears to congratulate him. He also tells them, since Kurda and Harkat are of the same soul, only one could survive. It is decided that Harkat will remain alive.\n\nBack at the Cirque du Freak, Harkat removes the panther's teeth and starts juggling the letters around, and just when he reaches HARKAT, he stops, apparently shocked, then rearranges it to find it reads KURDA SMAHLT. Darren then realizes that Harkat's name is an anagram and that the answer was in front of them all along, saying that if they spent more time on the teeth they might not have had to go through all the tasks. Harkat also takes out the postcards, pointing the time and date it was sent, noting that it was all dated twelve, twenty, thirty, and fifty years later. Harkat then reveals his theory: that the barren land they had visited was the future.\n\nIt is also told by Lady Evanna that no matter who wins the War of the Scars, either Darren or Steve would become the Lord of the Shadows who is a ruthless ruler of the night.","timestamp":"20090123232659","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Lambs","comment":"Created page with 'The Lambs are Gradys who executed those afflicted with Lycanthropy in the Demonata series.

Rank:\n| [[Unranked Vampire|Unranked]] (Once General to be Prince)\nHunter\n|- \n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: smaller;\" | {{{footnotes|}}}\n|}\n\n\n'''Larten Crepsley''', whom the protagonist of the Cirque Du Freak\/Darren Shan Saga series refers to simply as Mr. Crepsley, was the vampire who blooded [[Darren (Darren Shan)|Darren Shan]] in the [[Darren Shan]] series. Consequently, he became the mentor to the Vampire Prince, forming a father-son bond between him and the young Prince.\n\n[[Darren Shan]] revealed at the Edinburgh Festival that Mr. Crepsley would be the star of a four part mini-series, revealing his life before he met Darren. \n\n==Character History==\nThroughout the series, several facts about Mr. Crepsley's past are revealed. He was born to a poor family in the 1800s, and he never learned to read. Although his reason is never revealed, he became Seba Nile's apprentice during his late teen years (between 17 and 20). At first, he despised vampires and their customs, but, like Darren, grew to love them. He learned to manipulate spiders from Seba and eventually (possibly on Seba's recommendation) found his way to the Cirque Du Freak. After years with the Cirque, he left to journey to Vampire Mountain. During his time there, he won the respect of his peers and quickly became a General. Years later, they nominated him for the Vampire Prince. Only months from joining the Princes, Larten gave up the title of General and rejoined the Cirque.\n\nMr. Crepsley, according to the series, had a special mate, Arra Sails, whom he had unable to find any other female vampires to replace her after the vampaneze ambush caused  by Kurda Smahlt. This went on to haunt him, as seen in the book \"[[Hunters of the Dusk]]\" where Evanna gave Mr. Crepsley nine frogs, together forming a picture of the fallen female vampire, to make up for giving him the well-recognized facial scar years ago.\n\nMr. Crepsley was one of the vampires selected to go and hunt for the Vampaneze Lord besides Darren Shan and Vancha March. In the battle against the supposed Vampaneze Lord, Gannen Harst, and [[Steve Leopard]] in the Cavern of Retribution. Mr. Crepsley took over Darren's place to defeat the three vampanezes, putting others first before him as always, which caused all pacts agreed before amongst the two groups to go off. Mr. Crepsley had defeated the Lord, but was then pushed towards his death by Steve into the fiery-stakes pit. His death had been for nothing as Darren later discovered that Steve himself was the true Vampaneze Lord, the vampaneze that Mr. Crepsley had killed had been a decoy.\n\nMr. Crepsley's soul had been unable to be contacted by Evanna in the [[Lake of Souls]], to which the daughter of Desmond Tiny hoped was a sign indicating that he had gone to Paradise. \n\nMr. Crepsley was among the cherished and idolized characters in the series, thought to be as wise, mature, quick-witted and cunning. He was the one who helped Darren in learning the ways of the vampires besides teaching the Vampire Prince in dealing with his life as a vampire. In the beginning, he seems to be a very cruel character, but quickly becomes likeable.\n\n==Powers and Abilities==\nLike all vampires, Mr. Crepsley has super strength, speed, and endurance. His senses are also vastly improved by his transformation into a vampire. His teeth and nails are much harder than those of any human. He can flit, or move faster than even the eyes of vampires can follow. Larten can heal wounds with his saliva and breathe a poison than can knock its victims unconscious for 30 minutes (longer if the victim is not in good health).\n\nDarren often mentions that Larten has powers that exceed those of normal vampires. He can control certain animals, such as  spiders. Wolves are naturally drawn to a vampire. In [[Tunnels of Blood]] he shows Darren his power to dabble with illusions. Up to then, Darren thinks Mr. Crepsley is telekinetic, but the truth is, he is not. He snaps his fingers to distract the eye, and then rapidly snatches the object away from where it is. He does it so fast, it is impossible for humans to see, and vampires have to struggle to be able to see him. [[Trials of Death]] it is shown that he is exceptionally strong and fast, even for a vampire. In [[Trials of Death]], it is also revealed that he is among the most skilled of vampires at hand-to-hand combat and is most likely considerably better than most with weapons because he nearly became a prince. His other talents include lock picking (by using static electricity he builds up when flitting to force a lock open), playing a flute, and creating illusions.\n\n==Relations with Other Characters==\n'''Darren Shan:''' Larten has always had pride and confidence in Darren, although Darren initially hated him. Between [[Tunnels of Blood]] and [[Killers of the Dawn]], Darren and Larten slowly develop a father-son relationship. \n\n'''Vancha March:''' Larten and Vancha have a strong mutual respect. It is likely that they are old friends because of the many memories they share.\n\n'''Arra Sails:''' Larten's ex-mate is still very close to him even after their mating time ended, but they continue to have a somewhat romantic relationship. When Darren questions their relationship, he promptly changes the subject.\n\n'''Gavner Purl:''' Gavner seems to be Larten's closest friend among the vampires. Although they respect each other, they get endless joy from embarrassing one another, and one will often make insulting jokes about the other.\n\n'''Steve Leonard:''' Their relationship is one of pure hatred and they have both demonstrated that they are willing to die if it means that the enemy will die.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Mr. Crepsley carries bottled blood taken from corpses in Morgues to use in emergencies.\n*Mr. Crepsley has no nose hairs because he burned them out with a hot rod. (He had told Seba he wanted to be just like him, so his instructor pulled out a hair every time Mr. Crepsley spoke incorrectly. Especially when he used words such as \"don't\" or \"can't\" instead of \"do not\" or cannot\")and so his instructor pulled out ear hairs instead although Crepsley refused to tell Darren this as he found it too embarrassing.\n*Mr. Crepsley's reason for leaving before he became a Prince are never specifically stated. Gavner, however, believes he left because he was tired of fighting and killing.  Mr. Crepsley also shows a dislike of politics.\n*Mr. Crepsley got his scar from Evanna scratching him with her nail for trying to kiss her (when in one of her beautiful forms) while he was drunk. \n*Mr. Crepsley is the only hunter without a bond to one of the Vampaneze Lord's allies. Vancha had his brother, Gannen, Darren had his former friend Steve. Although they are not official hunters, Alice had her colleague Morgan James and Harkat indirectly caused RV's grudge against Darren, because Harkat was hunting with Darren when their battle began. Arguably Mr. Crepsley's experiences with Steve in the first novel, his bond to Darren, and the mutual hatred he shares with Steve could count as a different connection between himself and the Vampaneze Lord. \n*Mr. Crepsley usually wears red,(his favourite color), especially when he has visitors, as he wants \"to look his best for them\". (Another characteristic which he shares with Seba Nile) \n*Mr. Crepsley owns some pots and pans which he got from Evanna. They're special, as they can be compressed for safe- keeping when travelling.\n*Mr. Crepsley thinks everyone should know how to cook, and he teaches Darren how to cook a stew.\n*Mr. Crepsley used to \"dabble with illusions\" he loved doing tricks when he was young, and still likes to practice.\n*Mr. Crepsley does not know how to read or write.\n\n\n{{Sagaofshan}}\n\n[[Category:Characters in The Saga of Darren Shan|Crepsley, Larten]]\n[[Category:Fictional vampires|Crepsley, Larten]]\n\n[[th:\u0e25\u0e32\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e40\u0e17\u0e19 \u0e40\u0e04\u0e23\u0e1b\u0e2a\u0e25\u0e35\u0e22\u0e4c]]","timestamp":"20071225194106","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Larten_Crepsly","comment":"New page: he is vampire","content":"he is vampire","timestamp":"20090119021327","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Lauren_Shuler_Donner","comment":"New page: '''Lauren Shuler Donner''' will produce [[Cirque Du Freak (The Movie)]].","content":"'''Lauren Shuler Donner''' will produce [[Cirque Du Freak (The Movie)]].","timestamp":"20080112222407","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Liam_Fitz","comment":"New page: '''Liam Fitz''' is the director of the film \"[[Night Mayors]]\", which was produced by [[Davida Haym]].

All the lights are invisible to every being except [[Kernel Fleck]], one of the main protagonists in the series, who is capable to see these lights by being The Eye of [[Kah-Gash]] since born. The lights can be used to create Windows to any places in the universes. The spell used for creating Window usually takes long time to cast. [[Magician|Magicians]] and powerful [[Mage|Mages]] can complete the spell in few hours if it is cast in area with strong sense of magic. If not, the spell might take days to work. Others are not capable of opening Windows at all.

Grubbs finds out that the person who told her was his sister, Gret. So, Grubbs gets some rat's guts and puts it in a towel that Gret uses to shower with. It works, and his family are even more outraged, and they punish him. But the punishment ends early, and Grubbs is confused about the way his family are acting. They are treating him like it is the last time they will see him. One night Grubbs is told that Gret and his parents, Sharon and Cal, are going to see ballet and Grubbs is to stay at his aunt's house, Kate. He sneaks out of Kate's house and goes back to his own. When he opens the door, Sharon, Cal and Gret are all dead. They have been killed by a crocodile-dog animal and a hell-child, who accompany an eight-armed monster. They are part of the perilous other universe of the demonata.\n\nWith a burst of energy, he escapes from the house. After he tells the police his story, he is admitted into a mental hospital. He is very disturbed. One day, a man called Dervish comes to visit. He is Cal's brother (Grubbs' uncle.) He says he knows about demons. Soon, Grubbs decides to live with Dervish in his big mansion. Grubbs soon learns that magic is real, and his great-ancestor was a magician, and that some of Dervish's house is protected by magic. Dervish tells Grubbs that the eight-armed demon he saw is called Lord Loss, and that Lord Loss is a demon master, and is far more magical than anyone else. Grubbs learns he used a bit of magic to escape from the house in which Lord Loss killed his family.\n\nHe soon finds himself in 'The Hall of Portraits,' which is a room in the house that has pictures of family members (just in the Grady blood) that have died. One day, while exploring some abandoned stables at the back of Dervish's mansion in Carcery Vale, the village which he now lives in, he meets a boy named Bill-E Spleen. Bill-E knows Dervish very well, and wanders in the mansion sometimes. He believes Grubbs's tale about the demons. Bill-E believes that Dervish is his father, because he never knew his other father, and his mother died. But he is not certain. Bill-E and Grubbs become best friends and go to the forest one day. Bill-E says he has seen Dervish collecting dead animals from here, and thinks Dervish is a werewolf. At first Grubbs thinks he is crazy, but then soon learns his family has a curse, and most of the Gradys turn into werewolves at puberty. So one night Bill-E and Grubbs go out to spy on Dervish in the forest. But Grubbs soon sees that Bill-E is the werewolf, and Dervish just clears the dead animals.\n\nWhile Bill-E is locked up in a cage, Dervish tells Grubbs a few things. When his dad, Cal, went on business trips, he didn't always sleep alone, and had affairs. But one affair got the lady (Emily Spleen) pregnant, and she had the baby, Bill-E, but died after she had given birth. That makes Bill-E Grubbs's half-brother, and Dervish's nephew. And while Bill-E is still locked up as a werewolf, Grubbs learns the only cure for the werewolf gene is from Lord Loss. But you have to win a game of chess for him to obey. Grubbs's parents were killed because Gret was a werewolf. They kept it secret from Grubbs, and then played a game of chess with Lord Loss. They lost, and when you lose, him and his two companions (Artery and Vein) kill you.\n\nDervish comes to a conclusion that he will summon Lord Loss and play chess with him to cure Bill-E's wolfen genes. But the player needs someone to fight off Artery and Vein while playing the game, so Dervish picks Grubbs. Grubbs argues at first, but eventually Dervish summons Lord Loss and they go to a strange world where Lord Loss, Artery, and Vein are waiting for them. Grubbs fights Artery and Vein with great difficulty, but suddenly Dervish decides that Grubbs should play the chess instead. So, reluctantly changing positions with Dervish, Grubbs plays chess with Lord Loss. Incredibly scared, Grubbs starts to lose some moves. Then he realizes that the only way to win is to act casual, which is what Lord Loss hates. Grubbs wins the chess game, and Bill-E's wolfen genes are cured. Lord Loss is furious, but there is another challenge. If someone wins the game, they have to stay on to fight Lord Loss one-on-one. Dervish decides to do it, and Grubbs returns to the normal world. Dervish is a zombie in the real world, until he wins over Lord Loss. Grubbs waits anxiously, hoping that Dervish's normal senses will return. He doesn't tell Bill-E that he was a werewolf or that they are half-brothers. Dervish eventually returns, winning over Lord Loss. Grubbs starts to change, and the signs of the werewolf gene occur, but at the very end he discovers it is a practical joke from Dervish.","timestamp":"20090115170206","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Lord_Loss_(book)","comment":"New page: '''Lord Loss''' is the first novel in The Demonata series book by best-selling teenage horror author Darren Shan.

It was originally published in the UK on June 6, 2005. Soon after, it appeared in Japan and America, where Shan's previous series, The Saga of Darren Shan, had sold especially well. Set in Ireland. It is told in first person through Grubbs Grady, and in present tense.\n\n==Plot Summary==\nLord Loss follows Grubbs Grady, a child whose family are all heavy chess players\n\nAfter his parents and sister begin to talk behind his back and treat him differently, Grubbs starts to suspect that something is wrong. When his family decide to spend an evening at the ballet, Grubbs is dropped off at his aunt's house to stay the night, but decides to sneak out. He goes back to his own house to witness his parents and sister being murdered by the demon Lord Loss and his familiars, Artery and Vein. After fighting the demons to escape, Grubbs is admitted to a mental hospital and treated for hallucinations. Despite the efforts of the doctors, Grubbs sticks to his story that demons killed his family. After a few months, his uncle - Dervish Grady - visits him at the institute and invites him back to his home, assuring him that what he saw was real, and that he can explain the truth of it all.\n\nAfter being given permission by the hospital staff, Grubbs goes to live with his Uncle in Carcery Vale, where he befriends a child called Billy \"Bill-E\" Spleen who often spends time with Dervish. Bill-E (who was later found out to be Grub's brother) explains his theory that he is actually Dervish's son and Grubbs' cousin, although he has never asked Dervish about this.\n\nAfter the two boys find Dervish gathering up slaughtered animals in the woods near his house, Bill-E shares his theory with Grubbs that Dervish is a werewolf. He says this explains why the carcasses in the woods do not look like they have been killed by animals - they have been ripped down the middle and have human tooth marks. He speculates that lycanthropy is a disease which runs in Grubbs' family, and this is why Dervish's hall is lined with pictures of family members who died when they were quite young. At first, Grubbs doesn't believe it, but is gradually convinced as he notices Dervish leaving the house at night on multiple occasions.\n\nWhile Dervish is out, Grubbs discovers a secret tunnel and room underneath the house. Inside the room, he finds a cage with a deer, books on lycanthropy, and a picture of Lord Loss that comes to life and speaks to him. Terrified, Grubbs calls Bill-E the next morning, who hypothesizes that the cage is for Dervish to lock himself up in, and agrees to stay the night with Grubbs. Once Dervish leaves for the night, Grubbs and Bill-E (who is vomiting) decide to follow him. They track Dervish to Bill-E's house, where Bill-E collapses and Grubbs realizes that the real werewolf is Bill-E, not Dervish.\n\nDervish takes the boys back to his house, puts Bill-E (who is beginning to transform) in the cage, and explains that Bill-E is actually Grubbs' brother, not his cousin. Dervish tells Grubbs that the Gradys have always been cursed with lycanthropy, and that if a child begins to change, the only one who can reverse it is the demon master Lord Loss. The only way other than this method to get rid of the up-and-coming werewolf is to kill it, or call in the Lambs, a group of family executioners, who are mentioned in this book, as well as various others in the series. Most demon masters are violent and brutal like other demons, but Lord Loss is different, because he feeds on the suffering of humans and also has an affinity for chess. Hundreds of years ago, Bartholemew Garadex - a family ancestor - struck a deal with Lord Loss: he would play chess with him on the condition that for every game Bartholemew won, Lord Loss would lift the curse from one family member. If Bartholemew lost, Lord Loss would take his soul. After a fifty-nine game winning streak, Bartholomew died. Over the following centuries, various other family members challenged Lord Loss, but the demon master was wary, and set new rules. Two family members would be chosen to face Lord Loss at a midway point between the human and demon universes. One would fight Lord Loss' familiars while the other would play five simultaneous games of chess against Lord Loss. If they failed to win three games, or if the other family member was overcome before the games were over, all three family members would be killed. If they succeeded, the chess-player would travel to the demon universe to battle Lord Loss. If Lord Loss won the battle, then he would take the chess-player's soul.\n\nDervish summons Lord Loss, and Grubbs agrees to fight Vein and Artery while Dervish plays chess. After a few minutes, however, Dervish sees that Grubbs is not coping, and Lord Loss allows the two to change places. Grubbs loses at first, but eventually wins by adopting a jovial, optimistic attitude, depriving Lord Loss of the sorrow he needs to concentrate. Dervish travels to the demon universe to fight Lord Loss, and Grubbs is returned to Dervish's house. With its soul gone, Dervish's body continues to function unresponsively for fourteen months before Dervish finally returns, victorious.\n\n== External links ==\n*[http:\/\/www.darrenshan.com Official Darren Shan Site]\n*[http:\/\/darrenshan.blogdrive.com Official Darren Shan Blog]\n*[http:\/\/www.charlie-peterson.com A comprehensive Darren Shan Site]\n*[http:\/\/www.darrenshan.com\/demons\/index.html Demonata website]\n*[http:\/\/www.darrenshan.com\/demons\/books\/01lordloss.html ''Lord Loss'' on author's website]\n\n[[Category:Books]]\n[[Category:Demonata Books]]\n[[Category:Books narrated by Grubbs Grady]]","timestamp":"20080505213914","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Lord_Loss_(character)","comment":"New page: '''Lord Loss''' is the Demon Lord from Darren Shan's 10 book series The Demonata.

Lord Loss is supposedly the cause behind all sorrow and despair in the world; and his ways are what brings forth and Kernel Fleck into the Demon Universe.\n\nLord Loss is the only character to definitely have appeared in all five books, and is likely to appear in all of them.\n\nHe is the cruelest character in the books. Two of the three times that people betray their allies, he does not permit them to live. He also kills people in the cruelest way possible. In Bec he kills a woman by tormenting her with zombies of her dead children.\n\nLord Loss is the first demon to be named in this book, although Vein and Artery were described before him. He first appears during the slaughter of Grubbs' family, and then comes back later to play chess against Dervish and Grubbs, where he is beaten.\n\n= Appearences =\n\nLord Loss is the first demon to be named in this book, although Vein and Artery were described before him. He first appears during the slaughter of Grubbs' family, and then comes back later to play chess against Dervish and Grubbs, where he is beaten.\n\nHe lives in a castle made of webs. The webs vary from strong to thin in order to make the mechanisms of the drawbridge, etc. work. There is a moat with demon sharks at the bottom and instead of water there is empty space.\n\n\n\n== [[Lord Loss (Book)| Lord Loss]] ==\n\nIn Lord Loss, the title character is first seen killing the family of our protagonist, Grubbs, accompanied by Vein and Artery. Using his power to cure [[lycanthropy]], he instigates a game of chess against Dervish. As this opponent fails and leaves, Grubbs takes his place and makes a bad game worse. But once he notices that Lord Loss is feeding off his misery and desperation for it to be over, he puts on a happy fa\u00e7ade and storms to victory.\n\n== [[Demon Thief]] ==\n\nLord Loss masterminded the cruel plot to slowly drag Kernel towards him and let him realise the truth about Art.\n\n== [[Slawter]] ==\n\nLord Loss was the only Demon Master in the town of Slawter. Before the demons were released, he gave a speech to the crowd, then unleashed his demon followers. He had a one on one fights with both Dervish and Grubbs, but eventually they escaped with the 34 survivors of the cast and crew.\n\n== [[Bec (book)| Bec]] ==\n\nLord Loss purposefully assisted to destroy the demon attacks on Ireland, due to the fact that the human world was where he got his power from, through misery and sorrow. However, he did not permit any of the group that destroyed the tunnel to live. It is in this book he first learns about chess, as he sees Drust playing it. He also sours Bec \"victory\" with an admission to the futility of their mission, claiming that closing the tunnel had no effect and he had been crossing for centuries before that.\n\n== [[Blood Beast]] ==\n\nLord Loss is not seen until the plane scene where he and his demons start killing people on the plane. He rips the lower half of a womans face off and feeds it to Artery. It is unclear how Lord loss got in contact with Juni Swan, it may have been before or after Slawter but he seems to be working with Juni to lure Grubbs to his death. It is possible that Juni learned how to access Lord Loss during her travels when she was learning more about magic.","timestamp":"20070909153001","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Lord_of_Shadows","comment":"lord of shadows","content":"the lord of shadows is funny.","timestamp":"20090320182230","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Lord_of_the_Shadows","comment":"moved [[Lord of the Shadows]] to [[Lord of the Shadows (book)]]","content":"#REDIRECT [[Lord of the Shadows (book)]]","timestamp":"20091103184315","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Lord_of_the_Shadows_(book)","comment":"New page: '''''Lord Of The Shadows''''' is book 11 in [[The Saga of Darren Shan]], by [[Darren Shan]].  {{Infobox Book | <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Novels or Wikipedia:WikiProject_Books --> | na...","content":"'''''Lord Of The Shadows''''' is book 11 in [[The Saga of Darren Shan]], by [[Darren Shan]].\n\n{{Infobox Book | <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Novels or Wikipedia:WikiProject_Books -->\n| name          = Lord of the Shadows\n| image         = [[Image:LordoftheShadows.jpg|200px]]<!--prefer 1st edition-->\n| image_caption = New UK Cover for Lord of the Shadows\n| author        = [[Darren Shan]]\n| country       = [[United States]]\n| language      = [[English language|English]]\n| series        = [[The Saga of Darren Shan]]\n| genre         = [[Young adult novel|Young adult]], [[Horror novel]]\n| publisher     = [[Little, Brown]]\n| release_date  = Required\n| media_type    = Print ([[Paperback]])\n| pages         = Required\n| isbn          = ISBN Required\n| preceded_by   = [[The Lake of Souls]]\n| followed_by   = [[Sons of Destiny]]\n}}\n\n==Plot summary==\n\nDarren travels back to his home town with [[Cirque Du Freak]], plagued with the knowledge that no matter who wins the War of the Scars, either he or Steve will become the Lord of Shadows. He explores his town, marveling over changes until he finds his old home -- shocked it hasn't changed. Informed by a gossiper, Darren learns that his parents have moved and his little sister, Annie, has a son out of wedlock.\n\nOver the course of the book, he encounters Debbie and Alice as they attempt to recruit [[vampirites]] to fight with the [[vampire]]s, like the [[vampet]]s and [[vampaneze]] (The Vampirites are mainly hobos, or [[homeless people]]). In this book Darren encounters his sister, Annie, who believes he is dead, Steve and his henchmen, Morgan, Gannen, and R.V., as well as Steve's son, Darius, (who tries to kill him several times) and his old friend Tom Jones,who is now a professional [[soccer]] player(R.V. kills him) . Steve and his gang raid the Cirque while Mr. Tall and the others are speaking. Steve kidnaps Shancus, and Morgan kills Mr. Tall. Mr. Tiny and Evanna come to see Mr. Tall, and a startling revelation is made-Evanna and Mr. Tall are brother and sister, therefore making Mr.Tiny Mr.Tall's father. Darren talks with Evanna and realizes that no matter what happens, the harsh future that he and Harkat saw, will eventually come true. That if he did succeed in killing Steve, then he would end up turning evil and killing Vancha and all other vampires who stood in his way. The gang follow Steve to the old abandoned theatre where it all began. Steve says that he is Darren's blood brother, in a way. After the brutal killing of Evra's son Shancus, Darren prepares to surrender himself to destiny and kill Darius, but has second thoughts after a shocking revelation: Annie is Darius' mother, making Darius Darren's nephew.","timestamp":"20080104204857","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Lord_of_the_Shadows_(character)","comment":"New page: Lord of the Shadows - A destructive being, destined to be Darren's or Steve's future self, depending which side wins the War of Scars.

She is the [[albino]] love interest of [[Dervish Grady]] and has the ability to see things before they happen.\n\nIn the 6th book, [[Demon Apocalypse]], it is revealed that Juni is in fact Nadia Moore from the 2nd book, [[Demon Thief]], who has now joined forces with [[Lord Loss]].\n\n== Biography==\n===Early years===\nFrom an early age, Nadia's parents noticed that she had the ability to accurately predict the future. During her childhood, she travelled around, gaining money using her powers. One day, Beranabus found out about her and kidnapped her to join The Disciples. Nadia gained an undying hatred for Beranabus because of it, even when she had travelled with the Disciples for years.\n\nNadia's visions into the future are never specific, but often still helpful. In Demon Thief, she told Beranabus that a piece of the Kah-Gash would be found soon and that somebody from the group would die (this turned out to be Raz). Although in the book Kernel is able to lead her to freedom in the human world, Beranabus makes Kernel open a portal so that Nadia can be taken back into the Demonata universe. Nadia hated Beranabus even more for it.\n\nWhen The Disciples arrived at the castle of Lord Loss in Demon Thief, Nadia made a deal with Lord Loss that, if he would stage her death and relieve her of Beranabus, she would use her abilities to help him. This deal goes through, and Nadia is presumed dead by all the Disciples, except for Kernel, whom she reveals her secret to. Nadia claims to Kernel that she doesn't hate any of the Disciples except for Beranabus, but will still fight on the side of Lord Loss.\n\nIn [[Blood Beast]] Juni says she once had a baby, but he died. She also says she was at the concert that Dervish was at, possibly the one demons attacked in [[Demon Thief]]. This is almost definitely a lie because she spent most of her time between Demon Thief and Slawter in the Demonata universe. There is also the possibility that the baby was Lord Loss' as she states her love for him in [[Demon Apocalypse]].\n\nNadia is distantly related to the Gradys.\n\n===As Juni Swan===\n\nNadia changed her name to Juni Swan and tried to help Lord Loss capture Grubbs, Bill-E and Dervish.\n\nJuni Swan was Davida Haym's assistant on the set of [[Slawter]], but she was really working for Lord Loss. Her job was to make sure the children on the set were being treated well.\n\nDervish falls for her and Juni mentions at the end that she has strong feelings for him. However, she kills one of the leaders of the massacre plot and leaves in the night, leaving a note saying she has to think about it and he shouldn't search for her. \n\nIn [[Blood Beast]] she reappears as Grubbs' school councillor and continues her relationship with Dervish, as well as helping him attempt to cure Grubbs of the curse. Dervish and Juni's relationship becomes more serious and she nearly moves in with him. When Grubbs becomes a werewolf and kills Ma and Pa Spleen, she convinces him to board a plane with her, where it is revealed she is working for Lord Loss.\n\nIn [[Demon Apocalypse]], Grubbs discovers that Juni had actually killed Ma and Pa Spleen, and convinced him that he was a murderer. Later in the story, she is thought to be the key to opening the portal to the demon universe that would lead to the \"demon apocalypse\" the title of the book suggests, by [[Beranabus]]. He, along with Grubbs and Kernel, are tasked with killing her before she opens the portal for the demons to slip through. Her true form is revealed and she is actually Nadia Moore first seen in [[Demon Thief]]. She seduces Dervish, who she had previously tied up, but Dervish does not fall for this, and impales her on a stalagmite in the cave, killing her. Lord Loss shows affection for Juni, screaming \"My Swan!\", he takes her body with him after this confrontation. Dervish said that Lord Loss most likely ate her, as a joke.\n\n== Appearances == \n*[[Demon Thief]]\n*[[Slawter]]\n*[[Blood Beast]]\n*[[Demon Apocalypse]]\n\n{{demonata}}\n\n[[Category: Demonata Characters]]","timestamp":"20080104202152","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Night_Mayors","comment":"Created page with ''''\"Night Mayors\"''' is a film directed by [[Liam Fitz]] and produced by [[Davida Haym]].

Even though all the Demonata books can be read separately this book follows on from the 1st in the series, [[Lord Loss]] and the 2nd in the series, [[Demon Thief]]. The protagonist is [[Grubbs Grady| Grubbs (Grubitsch) Grady]], who was also the protagonist for [[Lord Loss]].\n\n== Plot ==\n\nThis book is set about a year after [[Lord Loss (book) | Lord Loss]] takes place. When the story takes place Dervish, who has just returned from his battle with [[Lord Loss]], is having mental problems. He has terrible nightmares and he attacks Grubbs in his sleep.\n\nA horror movie producer named [[Davida Haym]] offers Dervish a chance to work on the set of her new movie, \"Slawter\". \"Slawter\" is about demons. He quickly accepts the job thinking that it will be a good chance to help restore his sanity. Grubbs soon finds out that Davida has made a deal with Lord Loss that if she gets Dervish and Grubbs to work on the movie, she can film them live giving her the movie of her life. But when Dervish, Grubbs, Bill-E and a psychologist named Juni Swan try to escape, they encounter a barrier which sends them into a dream world. In this dream world, Bill-E has been captured by the Lambs so they can learn the secrets of how his Lycanthropy was cured.\n\nDervish, along with Shark and Sharmila (both in Demon Thief) invade the Lambs complex and demand the return of Bill-E Spleen. The Lambs refuse so they invade the complex and rescue Bill-E. Grubbs then realises too many convenient facts, including Shark happening to see the blueprints, the fact that they could use such powerful magic when no windows to the Demonata's universe were open, and the fact that the complex was an exact replica of Hannibal Lecter's cell.\n\nHe wakes up and finds himself in a small room in one of buildings that make up the town Slawter. Dervish and Bill-E are also in the room with him and he uses magic to wake them up. Juni is not with them and they presume her to be dead. The three of them then run into the town trying to warn people to get away by saying there is a gas leak and the town will explode soon.\n\nNo one heeds their warnings and Davida sets the Demons upon the unwilling cast and crew, but Lord Loss then betrays her and kills her. Most of the actors don't fight back - thinking this is a plot change - but soon realise its not and are killed. The three of them run and try to lure a demon closer to the invisible force field that surrounds the town so they can blow it up, making a hole in the wall and allowing them to escape. To do this they leave a sheepish Bill-E in an alley to attract a weak demon.\n\nFinally, one does come, after a girl named Bo Kooniart (who they previously disliked and whose father was in on Davida Haym's plot), a girl called Karin and three boys see them and run to them while being chased by a giant bee-like demon. Dervish and Grubbs subdue it but suddenly Juni reappears and kills it. To get another, Grubbs, Bo and Karin all lure a demon into chasing them, but are unlucky when Lord Loss finds them. Artery and a new cockroach-demon called Gregor are with him and the children run. Karin is soon killed off by Lord Loss's literal kiss of death, causing Grubbs and Bo to weep for her, which makes Lord Loss stronger. They eventually find the edge but Dervish is not there. Suddenly Dervish and Juni appear from under an invisibility shield and distract Lord Loss so Grubbs can move Gregor to the barrier. Juni is about to kill the demon before she is struck by Gregor's leg.\n\nGrubbs manages to open a window by killing Gregor but has to battle Lord Loss and Artery. Dervish attacks Lord Loss with the people he helped get through. Bill-E pulls a merely unconscious Juni through.\u2192 Grubbs then sees that Demons can get through so the creates another hole that only humans can get through. Grubbs then has to battle multiple demons to buy time for the people here. He realises he has power that he never knew he had, even the power to injure Lord Loss so Dervish can get out. Grubbs then runs out after Dervish and the window closes. An unlucky few are still trapped inside and Lord Loss then slaughters them brutally.He promises to get his revenge on Dervish, grubbs and Bill-E (similar to the geis he puts on the warriors in Bec). They realise that Bo did not make it out of the bubble surrounding Slawter as she went to try and save her father. They then see Davida's assistant director Chuda sitting there and Grubbs almost kills him but Bill-E stops him. Then Juni kills him with magic she never knew she had until fighting in the bubble. Later, they find that Juni has gone, and left a note saying that she had to be alone for a while after what she had done, and didn't want to be contacted.\n\nBack at Dervish's house, Dervish tells Grubbs about what his future would be if he did have magic. This causes Grubbs subconscious to hide his magic, even though Dervish said it was impossible. When Dervish scans Grubbs for magic powers he thinks he has none, but in truth, Grubbs had hid them without knowing. Later he decides to check if he did have powers, and managed to switch the light on and off without using the switch and make his reflection disappear. To have the power to conceal his powers from Dervish and to use magic in the real world away from any demons can only mean one thing - Grubbs is a magician.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* During the fight with [[Lord Loss]] nearing the end, Lord Loss tells Grubbs and Bo the name of the Cockroach demon ([[Gregor]]). This is a reference to the short story, ''Metamorphosis'' by '''Franz Kafka''', in which the main character, Gregor turns into a giant cockroach.","timestamp":"20080209214524","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Sons_of_Destiny","comment":"New page: its gay","content":"its gay","timestamp":"20080428182913","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Soul","comment":"Dervish said that in Lord Loss.","content":"Souls are real in [[The Demonata series]].

Her brother [[Mr. Tall]], had died earlier that day, and was shocked to find out she had two more brothers.\nMr. Tiny disowned Steve at that moment and left him to die.

It reveals a lot about the character of Harkat Mulds mainly and introduces a new character called Spits Abrams. This book also adds many more questions that will be answered in the next two books. Also, this book is the longest in the series.\n\nPlot\n\nThe Lake of Souls takes place right after Killers of the Dawn, with Mr. Crepsley dead and Steve's revelation that he is the Lord of the Vampaneze. Darren is unable to cry. He feels numb, but with the help of the bearded lady, Truska, he eventually does so. Mr. Tiny then appears and tells Harkat that if he wants his nightmares (which have returned) to stop, he must walk through a portal that Mr. Tiny makes. Harkat refuses to let Darren go with him. Debbie Hemlock and Police Chief Alice Burgess want to start an army to combat the vampets, but have to get the approval of the vampire princes first, so they are only mentioned briefly. Darren later decides that he should go with Harkat, much to Harkat's dismay. Darren and Harkat then walk through the mysterious portal, and are thrown into a strange world.\n\nDarren and Harkat are forced to complete many diffucult tasks. They first hunt down a black panther and collect a map inside it. Darren finds that the panther's teeth have been marked with letters. They start rearranging the teeth, with Harkat using up all the teeth to get SLAM DARK HUT, and then again to find it reads HARKAT MULDS. Harkat dismisses it as an utter waste of time, as Mr. Tiny loves to meddle with time. Harkat keeps the teeth, saying that they might be useful as they are sharp.\n\nNext they have to steal 'gelatinous globes' from the world's biggest toad. They arrive to see the toad standing in the middle of a lake surrounded by crocodiles. Darren and Harkat zip through the lake, grab a few globes, then run off.\n\nDarren and Harkat eventually meet up with Lady Evanna. Her appearance is completely unexpected, and she does not wish to tell the two how or why she is there. She helps them get across the lake where they meet a man who calls himself Spits Abrams. Spits is a former pirate and heavy drinker, and although Darren and Harkat do not trust him very much, they decide that Mr. Tiny put him in that world for a reason, and decide to take him with them.\n\nThey soon reach a small area filled with 'people' called Kulashkas. They are required to steal vials of 'holy liquid'. Darren and Harkat enter the village, Spits being afraid, to find the 'holy liquid' to be the venom from the fangs of a huge creature called the Grotesque. The Grotesque is apparently the Kulashkas' god. Darren and Harkat rush to two vials containing the venom and are attacked by the Grotesque.\n\nHarkat raises the vial as the Grotesque attempts to kill him, and the Grotesque backs off. The Kulashkas arrive, pointing spears at Darren and Harkat, trying to drive them back. They are driven closer to the Grotesque and Darren drives them back with his vial. The chief of the Kulashkas starts trying to speak to them in a non-understandable language, with Darren saying that he can't understand them. The chief starts gesturing that they are free to leave, but must return the vials to the altar which carried them. Darren starts to do so, but a drunken Spits arrives, throwing one vial at the Grotesque, which explodes, hurting the Grotesque and those nearby it, revealing the liquid to be highly explosive. Harkat sees floorboards underneath them and starts stomping on them. Darren joins in, with Spits saying, \"What in the devil's name are ye...\" before crashing through the floorboards.\n\nThey end up in a tunnel, following it until they reach a room. There is a fridge, which Spits asks about, as he did not have fridges in his time. There are also postcards, signed by Mr. Tiny. Harkat is bothered by the postcards, but does not explain why. They then leave the room, Spits taking a few extra bottles of whiskey.\n\nThey soon reach the Lake. It is seen to be covered with dragons and Darren and Harkat figure out that they should make bombs, filling the 'gelatinous globes' with the Grotesque venom and throwing it at the dragons. They finally get up close to the Lake and Spits says that when Mr. Tiny brought him here, he told him that there was a spell on the Lake forbidding dragons to be closer than eight metres to the Lake unless a living person fell into the Lake. Then Spits quotes on how many people are in the Lake of Souls. He starts talking about how the crew on the Prince o' Pariah, the ship he used to serve, loved his meals, revealing that he is a cannibal. Spits says that he plans to stay by the Lake of Souls, feeding of the people who lived there. He is persistently told not to feed on the souls and is accidentally knocked away from the eight metre zone. A dragon soon breathes fire at him and he is seen burning, running around not able to see, and then falls into the lake, breaking the spell.\n\nWhile being ruthlessly attacked by a dragon, Harkat pulls up his former identity, revealed to be Kurda Smahlt. The world freezes and Mr. Tiny appears to congratulate him. He also tells them, since Kurda and Harkat are of the same soul, only one could survive. It is decided that Harkat will remain alive.\n\nBack at the Cirque du Freak, Harkat removes the panther's teeth and starts juggling the letters around, and just when he reaches HARKAT, he stops, apparently shocked, then rearranges it to find it reads KURDA SMAHLT. Darren then realizes that Harkat's name is an anagram and that the answer was in front of them all along, saying that if they spent more time on the teeth they might not have had to go through all the tasks. Harkat also takes out the postcards, pointing the time and date it was sent, noting that it was all dated twelve, twenty, thirty, and fifty years later. Harkat then reveals his theory: that the barren land they had visited was the future.\n\nIt is also told by Lady Evanna that no matter who wins the War of the Scars, either Darren or Steve would become the Lord of the Shadows who is a ruthless ruler of the night.","timestamp":"20081013140728","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"The_Lambs","comment":"moved [[The Lambs]] to [[Lambs]]","content":"#REDIRECT [[Lambs]]","timestamp":"20091028182825","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"The_Lord_of_the_Shadows","comment":"[[The Lord of the Shadows]] moved to [[Lord of the Shadows]]","content":"#REDIRECT [[Lord of the Shadows]]","timestamp":"20080505180726","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"The_Saga_Short_Stories","comment":"New page: Below is a list of short stories written by [[Darren Shan]].

Darren then invites Sam and R.V. to the Cirque\u2019s next performance. During all of these events Darren is still refusing to drink blood and is becoming weak and suffering dizzy spells. R.V. sees the wolf man locked up in the cage and after the show he tries to release him; Darren sees R.V. doing this and tries to stop him but the wolf man escapes and bites R.V.\u2019s arms off(which R.V. blames on Darren) and the wolf man runs off into the forest where Sam is hiding. Darren follows Sam and the wolf man to the railway station where Sam is hiding. Darren and Sam try to run to a safer hiding space but the wolf man attacks them. Darren could have bested the wolf man but he was very weak due to lack of human blood.

Steve was hurt that Mr Crepsley Said he was evil and swore to hunt him down, Steve also found out that Darren was Mr Crepsley\u2019s assistant and swore to kill him as well.

Darren then invites Sam and R.V. to the Cirque\u2019s next performance. During all of these events Darren is still refusing to drink blood and is becoming weak and suffering dizzy spells. R.V. sees the [[wolf man]] locked up in the cage and after the show he tries to release him; Darren sees R.V. doing this and tries to stop him but the wolf man escapes and bites R.V.\u2019s arms off(which R.V. blames on Darren) and the wolf man runs off into the forest where Sam is hiding. Darren follows Sam and the wolf man to the railway station where Sam is hiding. Darren and Sam try to run to a safer hiding space but the wolf man attacks them. Darren could have bested the wolf man but he was very weak due to lack of human blood. Darren is knocked unconscious and wakes up to find the wolf man eating Sam who is dead; Mr Crepsley comes and knocks the wolf man unconscious(using a special knockout gas that full vampires can breathe) and some [[Little People|little people]] come to take the wolf man back to his cage.

Vancha March is noble and dedicated, but is also rude, dirty, and ugly in appearance, even under vampire standards.  He is a burly man, with dyed green hair, and \"smells like a wolf\".  Vancha is very dedicated to the old vampire ways and because of this, only battled using his hands, with the exception of using [[shurikens]], throwing stars which he carved himself.\n\nVancha March was one of the three chosen vampire hunters to hunt down and kill the Vampaneze Lord.  He was first a vampaneze but was re-blooded by Paris Skyle, the oldest of the Vampire Princes. His brother Gannen remained one of the vampaneze and later became the right hand man for Steve Leonard. Vancha was going to commit suicide after he let the Vampaneze Lord escape. He saw his brother, Gannen, with the Vampeneze Lord and just could not fight him due to his sheer surprise. Later on, he managed to recover, and in \"[[Sons of Destiny]]\" he fought brutally with Gannen.  He is also not averse to committing torture or worse to get what he wants, although this does depend on circumstance. Vancha is also a Vampire Prince and highly respected by all vampires, but Vancha cannot handle traitors and he would kill traitors. as a Prince he puts his clan before himself.","timestamp":"20071225195453","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Vanez_Blane","comment":"New page: '''Vanez Blane''' is the highest ranked tutor in [[Vampire Mountain]].

She is the ancestor of [[Grubbs Grady]] and narrates the book ''[[Bec (book)|Bec]]''. Bec reappears in [[Demon Apocalypse]] as a piece of the [[Kah-Gash]]. \n\n==Story==\n\nBec came from a bad line of blood. She was descended from a tribe of Celts who had bred with half-demons. This tainted the blood of these warrior's offfspring. As they bred with full-humans, the worst of the effect was bred out, but numerous people, when they entered their teens, would succumb to the disease of lycanthropy and become werewolves. Some, however, kept their humanity until death.\n\nHer mother Aednat had several children. They all were claimed by the cursed blood of their ancestors. Despairing, she and her husband swore not to have any more children for fear they would turn. However, Aednat discovered she was pregnant. Her husband planned with her to kill it, to spare them the agony of watching it turn. Aednat refused, feeling that the gods would not hurt her again after such a horrible series of children. When the husband diregarded her wishes and took her into the wood to kill the baby, Aednat stabbed him. The wound was fatal. Shocked, the tribe attacked her. Aednat fled into the night.\n\nShe eventually gave birth to a girl. After the birth, Aednat breastfeeds the baby while continually running, without clothes on. Aednat falls, her strength failing, and kisses the baby's brow before dying. The baby cries, arousing a nearby rath. A warrior called [[Goll]] investigates and finds Aednat and her child. He takes the child in and names her Bec. Bec remembers this as her first memory.\n\nBec grew up training to be a priestess, as she had some small magical talent. Her mentor dies, leaving Bec as the official priestess of the rath. She harbours a crush on the blacksmith, [[Fiachna]]. She also witnesses the rise of the Demons as they attack the tribes. After several battles, a boy arrives. He appears to have no intelligence, only capable of saying \"Run fast\". The tribe calls him Run Fast. Some refugees also join the tribe, saying their tribe was defeated by demons. Bec also sees the tribe leader make a decision to send a band of warriors out to find Run Fast's home village. Those who agree to go are the chief's son [[Connla]], the blacksmith Fiachna, and the warrior Goll. Also, a woman who arrived with the refugees accompanies them.","timestamp":"20080605064219","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Wolf-Man","comment":"[[Wolf-Man]] moved to [[Wolf Man]]: misspelling","content":"#REDIRECT [[Wolf Man]]","timestamp":"20080121182028","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Wolf_Island","comment":"moved [[Wolf Island]] to [[Wolf Island (location)]]:&#32;for consistency and disambiguation","content":"#REDIRECT [[Wolf Island (location)]]","timestamp":"20091103191500","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Wolf_Island_(Book)","comment":"moved [[Wolf Island (Book)]] to [[Wolf Island (book)]]","content":"#REDIRECT [[Wolf Island (book)]]","timestamp":"20091014221040","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"0","title":"Wolf_Island_(book)","comment":"New page: '''Wolf Island''' is the eight book in [[The Demonata]] series.

I discovered the series in 5th grade when my friend came up to me and told me to read the first book. For some reason  at first I didn't like it but my friend told me to continue reading it, so I finished it and I fell in love with it. I soon went to the library and checked out Vampires Assisstant, Tunnels of Blood, and Vampire Mountain. When I finished those I checked out Trials of Death, Vampire Prince, and Hunters of the Dusk. When it was my birthday I got Allies of the Night, Killers of the Dawn, Lake of Souls, and Lord of the Shadows. When I finished those I checked out Sons of Destiny (Which in my opinion is the best book). After I finished that I started reading The Demonata(another Darren Shan book) series and currently I'm waiting for Hell's Heroes(the final book to the Demonata) to be released. Recently I saw the movie but before you see it I recommend that you read the books first because the movie is a little different then the books. I also can't wait for the Mr. Crepsley miniseries to be released. I am also crossing my fingers that the rumor about a follow up to the Saga of Darren Shan is true because I can't get enough of the series.","timestamp":"20100411013427","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"2","title":"Mr.octa","comment":"","content":"==About me==\n\n''This is your user page.

I thought they were amazing (I also read them right after the twilight series so I had the will to live again)! I saw the movie The Vampire's Assisstant as well and was disappointed...it was okay in the beginning but then I was disappointed in how they left so much out and pretty much didn't look at the book. The good thing was that it wasn't like the Percy Jackson and the Olympians movie if anyone's seen that. At least The Vampire's Assistant followed the storyline. One question about the Vampire's Assistant: who was the monkey girl!? Was she supposed to replace Debbie Hemlock or something? I think that wasn't a good idea...and Evra didn't seem as friendly in the movie as he did in the book...they altered events alot in the middle but that battel in the end was pretty good to me. Next time they merge three books, could they at least TRY to arrange the events in chronological order?","timestamp":"20101205121010","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"2","title":"Satha_Vandral","comment":"","content":"==About me==\n\n''This is your user page.

Hi! \n\nIf you're looking for assistance, you can leave a message for the person who signed the welcome message. Follow the link to their talk page, and then hit \"edit this page\" to write your message. \n\nYou can also write to [mailto:community@wikia.com community@wikia.com] for general Wikia help.\n\n==Information for admins==\n\nThe Wikia Welcome tool is an automatic process that helps wiki admins to welcome new editors. The goal is to show new contributors that there's a community on the wiki -- and to help connect them to admins, so they know where to go if they have questions.\n\nWhen a contributor makes their first edit, the Wikia Welcome tool leaves a talk page message for them, and creates a user page. \n\nThe talk page message is signed by the [[Special:Listusers\/sysop|admin]] (or Wikia staff member) who's edited the wiki most recently, to help the contributor find someone who's available to talk to them if they need it.\n\nAdmins on this wiki can customize this in various ways, by editing the following pages:\n\n* MediaWiki:Welcome-message-user is the welcome message that's left for logged-in contributors. \n\n* MediaWiki:Welcome-message-anon is the welcome message that's left for anonymous contributors.\n\n* MediaWiki:Welcome-user-page is the user page that's created for logged-in contributors.\n\n* MediaWiki:Welcome-user -- You can use this page to change the signature that's left in the welcome message, or to turn the feature off. There are three settings for this page:\n**@latest -- This is the default setting. This means that the message will be signed by the latest admin to make an edit on the wiki.\n**Username -- If you replace @latest with a contributor's username, then all of the messages will be signed by that contributor.\n**@disabled -- This turns the feature off, so nobody gets a welcome message. If you turn it off, you can turn it back on again by replacing this with @latest or a username.\n\nIf you have any questions about the Wikia Welcome tool, please write to [mailto:community@wikia.com community@wikia.com].","timestamp":"20090312032506","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"2","title":"Wolf15","comment":"","content":"==About me==\n\n''This is your user page.

Too bad you had to join, did you know what you were getting in to when you joined Wikia? You got yourself into a world of corruption, greed and hatred. All staff members I have <s>shouted abuse at<\/s> talked to have displayed these three aspects. \n\nNo, I am not interested in the Vampire Wiki Alliance. Darren Shan Wiki is moving (or splitting or whatever Wikia calls it) to ShoutWiki, a much better host as it doesn't have Wikia staff on (nor that dreadful Oasis shit). \n\nNot sure why you haven't heard of me. It's kind of sad actually. I thought I would have gotten legendary status on Wikia as a vandal by now. I guess I have to try harder ;) \n\nWord of advice: get out while you are still liked, while you're still new. Once the anti-Wikia community gets to know you, you'll become hated too. You'll join the ranks of Sannse, Sarah Manley, Uberfuzzy, daNASCAT. You'll become scum. If you don't want that, quit Wikia. \n\nAnother word of advice, beware of me. I can become your enemy, and you don't want me as that. I hope I have made Sannse cry, regret her decisions (then again, for someone as evil as Sannse, that probably won't happen). If you want the same to happen to you, carry one being on Wikia. \n\nWikia is evil. Wikia is corrupt. Wikia is bad. All staff care about is money. Are you the same? \n\n[[Special:Contributions\/92.20.194.239|92.20.194.239]] 19:40, June 2, 2011 (UTC)","timestamp":"20110602194040","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"3","title":"Kernel88","comment":"welcoming new contributor","content":"==Welcome==\n\nHi, welcome to The Cirque Du Freak Wiki!

Hi! \n\nIf you're looking for assistance, you can leave a message for the person who signed the welcome message.

The goal is to show new contributors that there's a community on the wiki -- and to help connect them to admins, so they know where to go if they have questions.\n\nWhen a contributor makes their first edit, the Wikia Welcome tool leaves a talk page message for them, and creates a user page. \n\nThe talk page message is signed by the [[Special:Listusers\/sysop|admin]] (or Wikia staff member) who's edited the wiki most recently, to help the contributor find someone who's available to talk to them if they need it.\n\nAdmins on this wiki can customize this in various ways, by editing the following pages:\n\n* MediaWiki:Welcome-message-user is the welcome message that's left for logged-in contributors. \n\n* MediaWiki:Welcome-message-anon is the welcome message that's left for anonymous contributors.\n\n* MediaWiki:Welcome-user-page is the user page that's created for logged-in contributors.\n\n* MediaWiki:Welcome-user -- You can use this page to change the signature that's left in the welcome message, or to turn the feature off. There are three settings for this page:\n**@latest -- This is the default setting. This means that the message will be signed by the latest admin to make an edit on the wiki.\n**Username -- If you replace @latest with a contributor's username, then all of the messages will be signed by that contributor.\n**@disabled -- This turns the feature off, so nobody gets a welcome message. If you turn it off, you can turn it back on again by replacing this with @latest or a username.\n\nIf you have any questions about the Wikia Welcome tool, please write to [mailto:community@wikia.com community@wikia.com].","timestamp":"20090312081526","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"3","title":"Wolf15","comment":"welcoming new contributor","content":"== Welcome ==\n{| align=\"center\" style=\"border:1px solid black; background:#660909;  padding:10px; width: 100%;color: white;\"\n|\n[[File:Flit.jpg|250px|right]]\nHello, welcome to Cirque du Freak Wiki!

Then you can type or paste <nowiki>{{subst:welcJG}}<\/nowiki> on a newcomer's page and not need further personalising.\n\n\n[[category:help]]","timestamp":"20061110064158","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"14","title":"Actor_images","comment":"Created page with '[[Category:Film images]]'","content":"[[Category:Film images]]","timestamp":"20091102175849","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"14","title":"Administration_of_this_site","comment":"","content":"[[Category:Browse]]","timestamp":"20061114211811","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"14","title":"All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","comment":"Created page with '[[Category:Maintenance]]'","content":"[[Category:Maintenance]]","timestamp":"20091113151039","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"14","title":"Appearance_templates","comment":"Created page with '[[Category:Templates]]'","content":"[[Category:Templates]]","timestamp":"20091027165101","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"14","title":"Articles_with_invalid_date_parameter_in_template","comment":"Created page with '[[Category:Maintenance]]'","content":"[[Category:Maintenance]]","timestamp":"20091113151036","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"14","title":"Articles_with_unsourced_statements_since_July_2007","comment":"Created page with '[[Category:Maintenance]]'","content":"[[Category:Maintenance]]","timestamp":"20091113151033","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"14","title":"Blog_posts","comment":"Created page with 'user blogs'","content":"user blogs","timestamp":"20091008211752","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"14","title":"Book_covers","comment":"Created page with '[[Category:Images]]'","content":"[[Category:Images]]","timestamp":"20091102171611","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"14","title":"Books","comment":"New page: Books","content":"Books","timestamp":"20080420171316","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"14","title":"Books_narrated_by_Bec","comment":"New page: Books narrated by Bec","content":"Books narrated by Bec","timestamp":"20080420172510","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"14","title":"Books_narrated_by_Grubbs_Grady","comment":"New page: Books narrated by Grubbs Grady","content":"Books narrated by Grubbs Grady","timestamp":"20080420171359","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"14","title":"Books_narrated_by_Kernel_Fleck","comment":"Created page with '[[Category:Books]]'","content":"[[Category:Books]]","timestamp":"20091029175345","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"14","title":"Browse","comment":"","content":"This is a starting point which can be used to access any article on this wiki. \n\n[[Category:Browse]]","timestamp":"20091230175616","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"14","title":"CC-BY-SA_files","comment":"","content":"<center>\n<div class=\"boilerplate\" id=\"cc-by-sa\" style=\"width: 90%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: justify; background: #F8F8F8; padding: 0 10px; border: 1px solid #A8ACA8;\">\n''These files are licensed under the [[Wikipedia:Creative Commons|Creative&nbsp;Commons]] Attribution-ShareAlike License: http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-sa\/2.5\/ ''\n<\/div>\n<\/center>\n<br \/>\nTo add to this category, type <nowiki>{{Cc-by-sa}}<\/nowiki> on the image information page\n[[Category:uploaded files]]","timestamp":"20060925121746","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"14","title":"CC-BY_files","comment":"","content":"<center>\n<div class=\"boilerplate\" id=\"cc-by\" style=\"width: 90%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: justify; background: #F8F8F8; padding: 0 10px; border: 1px solid #A8ACA8;\">\n''These files are licensed under [[Wikipedia:Creative Commons|Creative Commons]] Attribution 2.5 License: http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.5\/''\n<\/div>\n<\/center>\n<br \/>\nTo add to this category, type <nowiki>{{Cc-by}}<\/nowiki> on the image information page\n[[Category:uploaded files]]","timestamp":"20060925121901","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"14","title":"CC-SA_files","comment":"","content":"<center>\n<div class=\"boilerplate\" id=\"cc-sa\" style=\"width: 90%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: justify; background: #F8F8F8; padding: 0 10px; border: 1px solid #A8ACA8;\">\n''These files are licensed under [[Wikipedia:Creative Commons|Creative Commons]] ShareAlike License: http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/sa\/2.5\/ ''\n<\/div>\n<\/center>\n<br \/>\nTo add to this category, type <nowiki>{{Cc-sa}}<\/nowiki> on the image information page\n[[Category:uploaded files]]","timestamp":"20060925121749","user-timestamp":0,"lang":"en"},{"namespace":"14","title":"Candidates_for_deletion","comment":"","content":"Articles in this category have been labeled for deletion.
