As a free module, its ring of scalars is the given ring, and its basis is one-to-one with the given group. As a ring, its addition law is that of the free module and its multiplication extends \"by linearity\" the given group law on the basis. Less formally, a group ring is a generalization of a given group, by attaching to each element of the group a \"weighting factor\" from a given ring.\n\nIf the given ring is commutative, a group ring is also referred to as a [[group algebra]], for it is indeed an [[Algebra (ring theory)|algebra]] over the given ring.\n\nThe apparatus of group rings is especially useful in the theory of [[group representation]]s.\n\n==Definition==\nLet ''G'' be a group, written multiplicatively, and let ''R'' be a ring. The group ring of ''G'' over ''R'', which we will denote by ''R''[''G''] (or simply RG), is the set of mappings ''f'' : ''G'' \u2192 ''R'' of [[Support (mathematics)|finite support]],<ref name=\"Polcino\">Polcino & Sehgal (2002), p. 131.<\/ref> where the module scalar product \u03b1''f'' of a scalar \u03b1 in ''R'' and a vector (or mapping) ''f'' is defined as the vector <math>x \\mapsto \\alpha \\cdot f(x)<\/math>, and the module group sum of two vectors ''f'' and ''g'' is defined as the vector <math>x \\mapsto f(x) + g(x)<\/math>. To turn the additive group ''R''[''G''] into a ring, we define the product of ''f'' and ''g'' to be the vector\n:<math>x\\mapsto\\sum_{uv=x}f(u)g(v)=\\sum_{u\\in G}f(u)g(u^{-1}x).<\/math>\nThe summation is legitimate because ''f'' and ''g'' are of finite support, and the ring axioms are readily verified.\n\nSome variations in the notation and terminology are in use. In particular, the mappings such as ''f'' : ''G'' \u2192 ''R'' are sometimes written as what are called \"formal linear combinations of elements of ''G'', with coefficients in ''R''\":<ref>Polcino & Sehgal (2002), p. 129 and 131.<\/ref>\n:<math>\\sum_{g\\in G}f(g) g,<\/math>\nor simply\n:<math>\\sum_{g\\in G}f_g g,<\/math>\nwhere this doesn't cause confusion.<ref name=\"Polcino\" \/>\n\n==Two simple examples==\nLet ''G'' = '''Z'''<sub>3<\/sub>, the [[cyclic group]] of three elements with generator ''a'' and identity element 1<sub>''G''<\/sub>. An element ''r'' of '''C'''[''G''] may be written as\n\n:<math>r = z_0 1_G + z_1 a + z_2 a^2\\,<\/math>\n\nwhere ''z''<sub>0<\/sub>, ''z''<sub>1<\/sub> and ''z''<sub>2<\/sub> are in '''C''', the [[complex numbers]]. Writing a different  element ''s'' as\n\n:<math>s=w_0 1_G +w_1 a +w_2 a^2\\,<\/math>\n\ntheir sum is\n\n:<math>r + s = (z_0+w_0) 1_G + (z_1+w_1) a + (z_2+w_2) a^2\\,<\/math>\n\nand their product is\n\n:<math>rs = (z_0w_0 + z_1w_2 + z_2w_1) 1_G  +(z_0w_1 + z_1w_0 + z_2w_2)a +(z_0w_2 + z_2w_0 + z_1w_1)a^2.<\/math>\n\nNotice that the identity element 1<sub>''G''<\/sub> of ''G'' induces a canonical embedding of the coefficient ring (in this case '''C''') into '''C'''[''G'']; however strictly speaking the multiplicative identity element of '''C'''[''G''] is 1\u22c51<sub>''G''<\/sub> where the first ''1'' comes from '''C''' and the second from ''G''. The additive identity element is of course zero.\n\nWhen ''G'' is a non-commutative group, one must be careful to preserve the order of the group elements (and not accidentally commute them)  when multiplying the terms.\n\nA different example is that of the [[Laurent polynomial]]s over a ring ''R'': these are nothing more or less than the group ring of the [[infinite cyclic group]] '''Z''' over ''R''.\n\n==Some basic properties==\nAssuming that the ring ''R'' has a unit element 1, and denoting the group unit by 1<sub>''G''<\/sub>, the ring ''R''[''G''] contains a subring isomorphic to ''R'', and its group of invertible elements contains a subgroup isomorphic to ''G''. For considering the  [[indicator function]] of {1<sub>''G''<\/sub>}, which is the vector ''f'' defined by\n:<math>f(g)= 1\\cdot 1_G + \\sum_{g\\not= 1_G}0 \\cdot g= \\mathbf{1}_{\\{1_G\\}}(g)=\\begin{cases}\n1 & g = 1_G \\\\\n0 & g \\ne 1_G\n\\end{cases},<\/math>\nthe set of all scalar multiples of ''f'' is a subring of ''R''[''G''] isomorphic to ''R''. And if we map each element ''s'' of ''G'' to the indicator function of {''s''}, which is the vector ''f'' defined by\n:<math>f(g)= 1\\cdot s + \\sum_{g\\not= s}0 \\cdot g= \\mathbf{1}_{\\{s\\}}(g)=\\begin{cases}\n1 & g = s \\\\\n0 & g \\ne s\n\\end{cases}<\/math>\nthe resulting mapping is an injective group homomorphism (with respect to multiplication, not addition, in ''R''[''G'']).\n\nIf ''R'' and ''G'' are both commutative (i.e., ''R'' is commutative and ''G'' is an [[abelian group]]), ''R''[''G''] is commutative.\n\nIf ''H'' is a [[subgroup]] of ''G'', then ''R''[''H''] is a [[subring]] of ''R''[''G''].  Similarly, if ''S'' is a subring of ''R'', ''S''[''G''] is a subring of ''R''[''G''].\n\n==Group algebra over a finite group==\nGroup algebras occur naturally in the theory of [[group representation]]s of [[finite group]]s. The group algebra ''K''[''G''] over a field ''K'' is essentially the group ring, with the field ''K'' taking the place of the ring. As a set and vector space, it is the [[free vector space]] on ''G'' over the field ''K''. That is, for ''x'' in ''K''[''G''],\n:<math>x=\\sum_{g\\in G} a_g g.<\/math>\n\nThe [[algebra over a field|algebra]] structure on the vector space is defined using the multiplication in the group:\n:<math>g \\cdot h = gh,<\/math>\nwhere on the left, ''g'' and ''h'' indicate elements of the group algebra, while the multiplication on the right is the group operation (denoted by juxtaposition).\n\nBecause the above multiplication can be confusing, one can also write the [[basis vector]]s of ''K''[''G''] as ''e''<sub>''g''<\/sub> (instead of ''g''), in which case the multiplication is written as:\n:<math>e_g \\cdot e_h = e_{gh}.<\/math>\n\n===Interpretation as functions===\nThinking of the [[free vector space]] as ''K''-valued functions on ''G'', the algebra multiplication is [[convolution]] of functions.\n\nWhile the group algebra of a ''finite'' group can be identified with the space of functions on the group, for an infinite group these are different. The group algebra, consisting of ''finite'' sums, corresponds to functions on the group that vanish for [[cofinitely]] many points; topologically (using the [[discrete topology]]), these correspond to functions with [[compact support]].\n\nHowever, the group algebra ''K''[''G''] and the space of functions ''K''<sup>''G''<\/sup> := Hom(''G'',''K'') are dual: given an element of the group algebra\n\n:<math>x = \\sum_{g\\in G} a_g g<\/math>\n\nand a function on the group ''f'' : ''G'' \u2192 ''K'' these pair to give an element of ''K'' via\n\n:<math>(x,f) = \\sum_{g\\in G} a_g f(g),<\/math>\n\nwhich is a well-defined sum because it is finite.\n\n===Regular representation===\nThe group algebra is an algebra over itself; under the correspondence of representations over ''R'' and ''R''[''G''] modules, it is the [[regular representation]] of the group.\n\nWritten as a representation, it is the representation ''g'' {{mapsto}} \u03c1<sub>''g''<\/sub> with the action given by <math>\\rho(g)\\cdot e_h = e_{gh}<\/math>, or\n\n:<math>\\rho(g)\\cdot r =  \\sum_{h\\in G} k_h \\rho(g)\\cdot e_h = \\sum_{h\\in G} k_h e_{gh}. <\/math>\n\n===Properties===\nThe dimension of the vector space ''K''[''G''] is just equal to the number of elements in the group. The field ''K'' is commonly taken to be the complex numbers '''C''' or the reals '''R''', so that one discusses the group algebras '''C'''[''G''] or '''R'''[''G''].\n\nThe group algebra '''C'''[''G''] of a finite group over the complex numbers is a [[semisimple ring]]. This result, [[Maschke's theorem]], allows us to understand '''C'''[''G''] as a finite [[Product of rings|product]] of [[matrix ring]]s with entries in '''C'''.\n\nGroup rings satisfy a [[universal property]].<ref name=\"Polcino\" \/>\n\n===Representations of a group algebra===\nTaking ''K''[''G''] to be an abstract algebra, one may ask for concrete [[group representation|representations]] of the algebra over a vector space ''V''. Such a representation\n\n:<math>\\tilde{\\rho}:K[G]\\rightarrow \\mbox{End} (V).<\/math>\n\nis an algebra homomorphism from the group algebra to the set of [[endomorphism]]s on ''V''. Taking ''V'' to be an [[abelian group]], with group addition given by vector addition, such a representation is in fact a [[module (mathematics)|left ''K''[''G'']-module]] over the abelian group ''V''.  This is demonstrated below, where each axiom of a module is confirmed.\n\nPick ''r'' \u2208 ''K''[''G''] so that \n:<math>\\tilde{\\rho}(r) \\in \\mbox{End}(V).<\/math>\nThen <math>\\tilde{\\rho}(r)<\/math> is a homomorphism of abelian groups, in that\n:<math>\\tilde{\\rho}(r) \\cdot (v_1 +v_2) =  \\tilde{\\rho}(r) \\cdot v_1 + \\tilde{\\rho}(r) \\cdot v_2<\/math>\n\nfor any ''v''<sub>1<\/sub>, ''v''<sub>2<\/sub> \u2208 ''V''. Next, one notes that the set of endomorphisms of an abelian group is an [[endomorphism ring]]. The representation <math>\\tilde{\\rho}<\/math> is a ring homomorphism, in that one has\n\n:<math>\\tilde{\\rho}(r+s)\\cdot v =  \\tilde{\\rho}(r)\\cdot v + \\tilde{\\rho}(s)\\cdot v <\/math>\n\nfor any two ''r'', ''s'' \u2208 ''K''[''G''] and ''v'' \u2208 ''V''. Similarly, under multiplication,\n\n:<math>\\tilde{\\rho}(rs)\\cdot v =  \\tilde{\\rho}(r)\\cdot \\tilde{\\rho}(s)\\cdot v. <\/math>\n\nFinally, one has that the unit is mapped to the identity:\n\n:<math>\\tilde{\\rho}(1)\\cdot v = v<\/math>\n\nwhere 1 is the multiplicative unit of ''K''[''G'']; that is,\n\n: <math>1 = e_e<\/math>\n\nis the vector corresponding to the identity element ''e'' in ''G''.\n\nThe last three equations show that <math>\\tilde{\\rho}<\/math> is a ring homomorphism from ''K''[''G''] taken as a group ring, to the endomorphism ring. The first identity showed that individual elements are group homomorphisms. Thus, a representation <math>\\tilde{\\rho}<\/math> is a left ''K''[''G'']-module over the abelian group ''V''.\n\nNote that given a general ''K''[''G'']-module, a vector-space structure is induced on ''V'', in that one has an additional axiom\n\n:<math> \\tilde{\\rho}(ar) \\cdot v_1 + \\tilde{\\rho}(br) \\cdot v_2 = a \\tilde{\\rho}(r) \\cdot v_1 + b \\tilde{\\rho}(r) \\cdot v_2 = \\tilde{\\rho}(r) \\cdot (av_1 +bv_2)<\/math>\n\nfor scalar ''a'', ''b'' \u2208 ''K''.\n\nAny group representation\n\n:<math>\\rho:G\\rightarrow \\mbox{Aut}(V),<\/math>\n\nwith ''V'' a vector space over the field ''K'', can be extended to an algebra representation\n\n:<math>\\tilde{\\rho}:K[G]\\rightarrow \\mbox{End}(V),<\/math>\n\nsimply by letting <math>\\tilde{\\rho}(e_g) = \\rho(g)<\/math> and extending linearly. Thus, representations of the group correspond exactly to representations of the algebra, and so, in a certain sense, talking about the one is the same as talking about the other.\n\n===Center of a group algebra===\nThe [[center of a group|center]] of the group algebra is the set of elements that commute with all elements of the group algebra:\n:<math>Z(K[G]) := \\left\\{ z \\in K[G] : \\forall r \\in K[G], zr = rz \\right\\}.<\/math>\n\nThe center is equal to the set of [[class function]]s, that is the set of elements that are constant on each conjugacy class\n:<math>Z(K[G]) = \\left\\{ \\sum_{g \\in G} a_g g :  \\forall g,h \\in G, a_g = a_{h^{-1}gh}\\right\\}.<\/math>\n\nIf {{nowrap|1=''K'' = '''C'''}}, the set of irreducible [[character theory|characters]] of ''G'' forms an orthonormal basis of ''Z''(''K''[''G'']) with respect to the inner product\n:<math>\\left \\langle \\sum_{g \\in G} a_g g, \\sum_{g \\in G} b_g g \\right \\rangle = \\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum_{g \\in G} \\bar{a}_g b_g.<\/math>\n\n==Group rings over an infinite group==\nMuch less is known in the case where ''G'' is countably infinite, or uncountable, and this is an area of active research.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Passman, Donald S.|title=What is a group ring?|journal=Amer. Math. Monthly|volume=83|year=1976|pages=173\u2013185|url=http:\/\/www.maa.org\/programs\/maa-awards\/writing-awards\/what-is-a-group-ring|doi=10.2307\/2977018}}<\/ref> The case where ''R'' is the field of complex numbers is probably the one best studied. In this case, [[Irving Kaplansky]] proved that if ''a'' and ''b'' are elements of '''C'''[''G''] with ''ab'' = 1, then ''ba'' = 1. Whether this is true if ''R'' is a field of positive characteristic remains unknown.\n\nA long-standing conjecture of Kaplansky (~1940) says that if ''G'' is a [[torsion-free group]], and ''K'' is a field, then the group ring ''K''[''G''] has no non-trivial [[zero divisor]]s. This conjecture is equivalent to ''K''[''G''] having no non-trivial [[nilpotent]]s under the same hypotheses for ''K'' and ''G''.\n\nIn fact, the condition that ''K'' is a field can be relaxed to any ring that can be embedded into an [[integral domain]].\n\nThe conjecture remains open in full generality, however some special cases of torsion-free groups have been shown to satisfy the zero divisor conjecture. These include:\n\n* Unique product groups (e.g. [[orderable group]]s, in particular [[free group]]s)\n* [[Elementary amenable group]]s (e.g. [[virtually abelian group]]s)\n* Diffuse groups - in particular, groups that act freely isometrically on ''R''-trees, and the fundamental groups of surface groups except for the fundamental groups of direct sums of one, two or three copies of the projective plane.\n\nThe case of ''G'' being a [[topological group]] is discussed in greater detail in the article on [[group algebra]]s.\n\n==Representations of a group ring==\nA module ''M'' over ''R''[''G''] is then the same as a [[group representation|linear representation]] of ''G'' over the field ''R''. There is no particular reason to limit ''R'' to be a field here. However, the classical results were obtained first when ''R'' is the [[complex number]] field and ''G'' is a finite group, so this case deserves close attention. It was shown that ''R''[''G''] is a [[semisimple ring]], under those conditions, with profound implications for the representations of finite groups. More generally, whenever the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of the field ''R'' does not divide the order of the finite group ''G'', then ''R''[''G''] is semisimple ([[Maschke's theorem]]).\n\nWhen ''G'' is a finite [[abelian group]], the group ring is commutative, and its structure is easy to express in terms of [[root of unity|roots of unity]]. When ''R'' is a field of characteristic ''p'', and the prime number ''p'' divides the order of the finite group ''G'', then the group ring is ''not'' semisimple: it has a non-zero [[Jacobson radical]], and this gives the corresponding subject of [[modular representation theory]] its own, deeper character.\n\n==Category theory==\n\n===Adjoint===\n[[Category theory|Categorically]], the group ring construction is [[left adjoint]] to \"[[group of units]]\"; the following functors are an [[adjoint functors|adjoint pair]]:\n:<math>\\operatorname{GrpRng}\\colon \\mathbf{Grp} \\to R\\mathbf{\\text{-}Alg}<\/math>\n:<math>\\operatorname{GrpUnits}\\colon R\\mathbf{\\text{-}Alg} \\to \\mathbf{Grp}<\/math>\nwhere \"GrpRng\" takes a group to its group ring over ''R'', and \"GrpUnits\" takes an ''R''-algebra to its group of units.\n\nWhen ''R'' = '''Z''', this gives an adjunction between the [[category of groups]] and the [[category of rings]], and the unit of the adjunction takes a group ''G'' to a group that contains trivial units: ''G'' \u00d7 {\u00b11} = {\u00b1''g''}. In general, group rings contain nontrivial units. If ''G'' contains elements ''a'' and ''b'' such that <math>a^n=1<\/math> and ''b'' does not normalize <math>\\langle a\\rangle<\/math> then the square of\n\n:<math>x=(a-1)b \\left (1+a+a^2+...+a^{n-1} \\right )<\/math>\n\nis zero, hence <math>(1+x)(1-x)=1<\/math>. The element 1+''x'' is a unit of infinite order.\n\n===Generalizations===\nThe group algebra generalizes to the [[monoid ring]] and thence to the [[categorical algebra]], of which another example is the [[incidence algebra]].\n\n==Filtration==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2008}}\nIf a group has a [[length function]] \u2013 for example, if there is a choice of generators and one takes the [[word metric]], as in [[Coxeter group]]s \u2013 then the group ring becomes a [[filtered algebra]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Group algebra]]\n* [[Monoid ring]]\n\n===Representation theory===\n* [[Group representation]]\n* [[Regular representation]]\n\n===Category theory===\n* [[Categorical algebra]]\n* [[Group of units]]\n* [[Incidence algebra]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{springer|id=G\/g045220|title=Group algebra|author=A.

Hamor wrote in a letter to the Council after the attack on the Flowerieu Hundred plantation: \"So sudden in their cruel execution, that few or none discerned the weapon or blow that brought them to destruction.\"  That evening, Captain Hamor took his ship and a [[Pinnace (ship's boat)|Pinnace]] to attempt to collect the wounded from the different plantations.  On June 27, Hamor reached an agreement with the King of the Potomac Indians against the Opechancanough and Necochincos tribes, \"Their and our enemy.\"  In mid-July, Captain Newport was killed in an attack.<!--by who upon whom? --><ref>https:\/\/archive.org\/stream\/robinsonstheirki02robi\/robinsonstheirki02robi_djvu.txt<\/ref>\n\nAs Council member, Hamor was granted land from the [[Virginia Company]] in June 1621, upon which he began to establish his own [[plantations in the American South|plantation]].  And, on November 28, 1621, the new Governor, [[Sir Francis Wyatt]], appointed Ralph Hamor to the King's Council.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"\/>\n\nOne of Captain Hamor's official duties as Council member was to insure that Lady Cecily Delaware was satisfied with the cultivation of her assigned Virginian land.<ref name=McCartney2007 >{{citation | last=McCartney | first=Martha W. | year=2007 | title=Virginia immigrants and adventurers, 1607-1635: a biographical dictionary | publisher=Genealogical Pub.

Thomas was wounded with an arrow to the back during the attack, and his cousin Nathaniel Powell was killed.<ref>\"Genealogies of Virginia Families from Tyler's Quarterly Historical\" p.380, By Genealogical Publishing Company<\/ref>\nAfter the attack, Hamor was ordered to escort the surviving Warrosquyoake Shire settlers to the safety of [[Jamestown Island]], then to stand as command of the [[Martin's Hundred]] settlers who were also brought up to Jamestown.  Once things settled down, Hamor found himself in a land dispute with one of the biggest plantation owners in Virginia, [[Edward Bennett (colonist)|Edward Bennett]].<ref name=McCartney2007 \/> In the summer of 1622, Hamor embarked on a few trade expeditions, as well as a few retaliatory raids against the Native Americans.\n\nBy the summer of 1622, the colony was struggling with maintaining adequate food supplies, so the Council ordered several ships to travel far up the [[Chesapeake Bay]] to trade with other tribes for food, and if diplomacy failed, use force.  Captain Eden commanded the \"Furtherance\" while Captain Hamor commanded the \"Tiger\" up the bay.  These efforts brought back 4,000&nbsp;lbs of critically needed corn.\n\nThe ship \"Abigail\" arrived in December, loaded with armor and gunpowder rather than the expected and very necessary food supplies.  This ship also was loaded with sick passengers, all of whom were allowed to come ashore.  By the spring of 1623, another 500 colonists died from illness, malnutrition, and more sporadic Indian attacks.\n\n==Later Years==\nOn June 11, 1623, Ralph's brother Thomas Hamor died of a burning fever, as reported by surgeon [[Samuel Mole]]; Ralph inherited the rights to Thomas' land. In that same year, Ralph married Elizabeth Fuller, born in 1579.  Elizabeth was the widow of Jeffrey Clements.  Elizabeth had seven children from her previous marriage, born between 1601 and 1609 in [[Clarkenwell|Clarkenwell, England]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Adventurers of Purse and Person Virginia 1607-1624\/5<\/ref> In October of that same year, Hamor gave a formal update to the Virginia Company of the condition of the Colony.<ref name=McCartney2007 \/>\n\nDuring the spring of 1624, Ralph Hamor became involved in another land dispute, this time with [[Ralph Evers]], over cleared land on [[Hog Island (Virginia)|Hog Island]]. Evers was eventually allowed the rights to the land, and Hamor was given 200 acres along with funds compensating him for the building he erected on the property given to Evers.<ref name=McCartney2007 \/>\n\nOn August 14, 1624, Hamor acquired a home on a 1.5 acre lot.<ref>\"Early Virginia Families Along the James River: James City County, Surry\"  By Louise Pledge Heath Foley<\/ref> He resided there with his wife, Elizabeth, and two of her children, Jeremiah II and Elizabeth Clements. According to the 1624 [[Census]] of [[Hog Island (Virginia)|Hog Island]], Hamor had a total of seven servants.<ref>http:\/\/www.rootsweb.ancestry.com\/~vamip\/vamip\/1624_census_hog_island.htm<\/ref> Six of those servants, Jeoffrey Hull, Mordecay Knight, Thomas Doleman, Elkinton Ratcliffe, Thomas Powell, and John Davies, lived with them.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"\/>\n\nBy 1625, Hamor had acquired 250 acres on Hog Island, and another 500 acres at [[Blue Point (Virginia)|Blue Point]], while remaining involved in legal matters of the Jamestown colony, including land disputes, public blasphemy hearings, illegal alcohol sales, even the authorization of the arrest of the town's [[gunsmith]] John Jefferson, who eloped with his maidservant.<ref name=McCartney2007 \/>\n\nCaptain Hamor died around October 11, 1626.

I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the [[copyright]] status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.\n\nIf the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created\/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{tl|GFDL-self}} tag can be used to release it under the [[GFDL]]. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]], and then use a tag such as {{tlp|Non-free fair use in|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use]].

In 1744 she married politician [[Major]] Christian Sigfred Scheel von Plessen (1716, [[Glorup Manor]] \u2013 1755). In 1761 she made an unsuccessful attempt to start a girls' school. In 1766, she was appointed head lady-in-waiting ([[Mistress of the Robes]]) of the court of the new queen, Princess [[Caroline Matilda of Great Britain]]. She became the queen's confidante and was blamed for isolating her from [[Christian VII of Denmark|her mentally ill husband]] because she disliked the king's friends, and she, with Ditlev Reventlow, became opposed to the king's circle which ultimately led to her exile in 1768; first to her estate, but then, as there was a fear of her influence, to [[Celle Castle|Celle]], [[Germany]]. Reportedly, the queen took her dismissal hard, and her immediate replacement, Charlotte Elisabeth Henriette Holstein, was not accepted - she was therefore not truly replaced [[Margrethe von der L\u00fche]] agreed to accept the post. \n\nIn 1771 Queen Caroline Matilda decorated Louise with her own [[Order (decoration)|Order]] of Mathilde (''[[Mathildeordenen]]'').\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n<!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]] -->\n{{Persondata\n|NAME              = Plessen, Louise von\n|ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n|SHORT DESCRIPTION = Lady-in-waiting, writer\n|DATE OF BIRTH     = 26 April 1725\n|PLACE OF BIRTH    = Vienna, Austria\n|DATE OF DEATH     = 14 September 1799\n|PLACE OF DEATH    = Celle, Kingdom of Hanover\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Plessen, Louise Von}}\n[[Category:1725 births]]\n[[Category:1799 deaths]]\n[[Category:18th-century Danish people]]\n[[Category:18th-century women writers]]\n[[Category:Danish ladies-in-waiting]]\n[[Category:Danish memoirists]]\n[[Category:Danish nobility]]\n[[Category:Danish people of German descent]]\n[[Category:Danish women writers]]\n[[Category:People from Celle]]\n[[Category:Mistresses of the Robes]]\n[[Category:Women memoirists]]\n\n\n{{Denmark-writer-stub}}","timestamp":"20160410095930","user-timestamp":"20150410095930"},{"title":"User talk:67.82.209.183","content":"\n== December 2012 ==\n[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, I'm [[User:Rushbugled13|Rushbugled13]].

Larouche played two seasons in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) split between the [[Ottawa Senators]], [[New York Rangers]], and [[Los Angeles Kings]] from [[1994\u201395 NHL season|1994]]\u2013[[1995\u201396 NHL season|1996]].  He currently plays for [[Trois-Rivi\u00e8res Caron & Guay]] of the [[Ligue Nord-Am\u00e9ricaine de Hockey]].\n\n==Playing career==\nLarouche was drafted 41st overall by the [[Montreal Canadiens]] in the [[1989 NHL Entry Draft]]. He was a standout scorer in junior, playing for the [[Trois-Rivi\u00e8res Draveurs]] of the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]], scoring 153 and 145 points in the 1988\u201389 and 1989\u201390 seasons, respectively. In 1990\u201391, now with the [[Chicoutimi Saguen\u00e9ens]], he led the team to the [[Memorial Cup]] by leading the QMJHL in playoff goals, assists, and points.\n\nThe next season, Larouche advanced to the [[American Hockey League]] to play for the [[Fredericton Canadiens]]. However after two solid seasons with the club, he never got called up to the NHL and he played the 1993\u201394 season for the [[Atlanta Knights]] of the [[International Hockey League (1945\u20132001)|International Hockey League]], and continued his scoring success by scoring 96 points in the regular season, and leading the IHL in playoff goals and points in the playoffs as the Knights won the [[Turner Cup]].\n\nLarouche was signed by the [[Ottawa Senators]] in the fall of that year, but because of the [[1994\u201395 NHL lockout]] he found himself back down in the AHL with the [[Prince Edward Island Senators|P.E.I. Senators]]. Nevertheless, he led the league in goals with 53 in only 70 games, and finally got a chance with the Senators late in the season. He did not disappoint, scoring eight goals and fifteen points in only eighteen games. However before the next season started, he was traded to the [[New York Rangers]] for [[Jean-Yves Roy]], and then later on to the [[Los Angeles Kings]] for [[Chris Snell]]. He was back in the minors permanently by the end of the season, and he continued on in the IHL, scoring at a prolific pace until the league disbanded in 2001. After this he went on to play hockey in Germany, Finland and Switzerland.

Any ideas on how to break it up? - benje309\n:Actually, there are many pages which are much larger (and proposing to break up their sacred cows is often shunned - but that's another issue).  That said, I've tossed around the idea of creating individual pages for each season of a particular team.  They could include recaps, highlights, day-by-day results, etc.  But it's only been attempted on small scales ([[1999 Minnesota Twins]]) and I haven't invested any time in the idea either.  \u2014[[User:wknight94|Wknight94]] ([[User talk:wknight94|talk]]) 23:34, 7 June 2006 (UTC)\n\n==Fan Base==\nWhy did someone mark up for \"references or sources\" in the fan base section?  There does not seem like there is any need for it there as all  the information there seems correct and excellent.\n-bootleg42\n:I don't remember who did that but it's likely because, for a while, people were just randomly adding names to that list without citing any sources.  A little bit of digging showed that several of them were wrong.  Personally, I'm not sure how encyclopedic it is to list every single notable person that may be a fan of a team - but that's just me.  \u2014[[User:wknight94|Wknight94]] ([[User talk:wknight94|talk]]) 13:55, 2 April 2006 (UTC)\n\n==Current Stars==\nIs there a set, agreed-upon convention for what constitutes a Current Star and someone who is Not to be Forgotten? It seems like a lot of effort is spent plugging players in and out of those categories essentially because of confusion over who belongs where.\n\nMy sense of what a Current Star should be is a player who has achieved a much higher than average level of success at the major league level and is one of the true \"impact\" players on his team. It can also be a player whose minor league career has been exceptional and comes to the majors with high expectations. I think a Not to be Forgotten player essentially ought to be a player who, when he was on the team's active roster, was a Current Star for several years, with the possible exception of a lesser player who made an extraordinary play or a crucial hit in a pivotal game that led to a championship.\n\nPersonally, I don't believe players of lesser ability but who are \"fan favorites\" should be included in either category. Nor do I feel that players whose accomplishments with the club are limited to triviata - first hit, first baserunner, first grand slam, etc. I believe there ought to be a place for that kind of information - the more the better - but I think it's important to establish and maintain the integrity of the sections so we can spend more time adding new information.\n\nOne suggestion I have is creation of two new pages: one would be a list of the Mets' active roster and the other would be dedicated to the historic 1962 Mets. These pages would be linked to from the main Mets page. This might help capture the kind of information that seems just outside the bounds of the Current Stars and NTBF sections.\n\nWhat do others think? \n\n-- Veronique\n\n\nThe only thing that I disagree with is that I think a player who has been a fan favorite for quite some time should be included on the aforementioned lists.  I assume we are talking about Joe McEwing and Ty Wigginton here. In my opinion, McEwing should be on the list but Wigginton should not be. McEwing has established himself as a true Met for several seasons.  Only Franco and Piazza have a longer tenure in the clubhouse (in an age when players rarely remain with the same team for so long), plus he was on the 2000 team. Wigginton, although likeable, is really just the latest in a very long line of average Mets players. Certainly he is no more important than Kevin Mitchell who is not on the list.\n\n-- George78\n\n\nI'll tell you what, stars can be whoever, but Mike Cameron is definitely not a \"star.\" [[User:162.84.196.235|162.84.196.235]] 04:03, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)\n\nJoe McEwing Stinks\nTy Wiggington is Gone but Stunk\nJohn Franco Stank\nPiazza was good untill the last few seasons\n\nMy list\n\nDavid Wright \nJose Reyes\nCarlos Delgado\nPedro\n\n== Player bios ==\n\nI'm tired of all the red links in the 25-man roster section.

I think he was born on a US base in Vietnam. Anyone else think so?\n\n:I'm not sure if he was born on a base, but his father is American and his mother is Vietnamese. He's definitely an American citizen and may or may not have Vietnamese citizenship. Since he was moved to the US as an infant and has spent the rest of his life here, I think a US flag makes more sense. --[[User:Veronique|Veronique]] 03:32, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)\n\n== Not to be Forgotten ==\n\nHow about including broadcasters in the Not to Be Forgotten section?

Anyone agree?  Maybe someone wants to add a section or new article about some of the more interesting Mets transactions in club history (esp. the ones where the results could be analyzed)?  There's lots that could be mentioned there like the deals I mentioned above, Gary Carter, trading away Nolan Ryan and Amos Otis, not drafting Reggie Jackson, etc. [[User:Wknight94|wknight94]] 15:20, 5 December 2005 (UTC)\n:I don't think that's necessary, but I do agree that there's way too much material on this offseason.

[[User:Niffweed17|Niffweed17]] 05:19, 28 December 2005 (UTC)\n\n== The \"Piazza\" era? ==\n\nI don't think it's appropriate to coin the term \"Piazza\" era here.  Indeed, the last couple years with Piazza have been nothing to write home about.  This should be removed to more appropriately reflect the more glorious times from 1997-2000. [[User:Niffweed17|Niffweed17]] 05:22, 28 December 2005 (UTC)\n:Up to you.  It was something I figured I would try out.  It wasn't meant to imply that everything has been great with Piazza - just that he has been the centerpiece of the team since he arrived which I'd say was mostly true.  As Piazza declined starting in '02, so did the Mets.  When he missed most of '03, the Mets lost 95 games.  I'd say the as-Piazza-goes-so-go-the-Mets era went from '98 to '04.  During that time, when people thought Mets, they thought Piazza.  But maybe that's just me.  If for no other reason, his draw on the checkbook affected the team for his entire tenure.  Again, I'm not married to the idea, just something I threw out there - I won't fight a reasonable change.  If I remember right, the previous section heading was just 2000s which I felt reflected the real flavor of the \"era\" even less.  They started turning around in '98.  In '97, they had a respectable record but were never in contention.  In '98, only a five-game losing streak to end the season knocked them out of the wild card.  I could maybe see a reason to call it the Valentine era but I'm not real convinced he was the reason for the turnaround.\n\n:While I'm on the subject of seasonal recaps, see my next section...  [[User:Wknight94|wknight94]] 12:20, 28 December 2005 (UTC)\n\n::At least in terms of syntax, it's just as much the [[Al Leiter]] era. [[User:Zookman12|Zookman12]] 19:43, 28 December 2005 (UTC)\n\n:::I could buy that more than the Valentine era.  Still, the Mets record doesn't seem to reflect Leiter's as much as Piazza's.  Leiter's worst Mets year was '99 when they made the playoffs and he was very good in '01, '02 and '04 when the Mets sucked.  But then he also had a good record in '03 when the Mets were awful!  I don't know - I just don't think of Leiter as being the guy that determined the Mets' fortunes.

What about Ventura who had arguably the best season of his career and actually received more MVP consideration than Piazza.  What about Alfonzo who had his only 100 RBI season and also got MVP consideration?  What about Cedeno who hit .313 and set the all-time Mets single-season stolen base record?\n# How did the Mets start somewhat badly in '99?  On May 3, they were 17-9, the 4th-best record in the Majors!  Things didn't turn sour until the beginning of June when they lost 8 straight and dropped below .500 for one day.  Early June doesn't count as a \"start\" IMHO.\n# I don't get the comment about Rocker.  He'd already been in Atlanta for two whole regular seasons so how were the Mets not introduced to him until the '99 NLCS?\n# What does it mean that 2000 \"began normally\"?\n# The assertion that Bell was the best hitter in the first month of 2000 is possible but questionable.\n# In the [[2000-06-30]] game, the Mets comeback was in the 8th inning, not the 7th.\n# Hampton didn't perform well \"throughout\" the 2000 NLCS - he only played in two games.\n\u2014[[User:wknight94|Wknight94]] ([[User talk:wknight94|talk]]) 12:22, 20 March 2006 (UTC)\n\nWKnight94, I agree with most of what you said and I changed some things in the Piazza era part. But there were still some parts I didn't change and agree with like the Bonilla part. Even though Met fans probably didn't expect much, Steve Phillips (not a smart GM) and the Mets organization did because they gave him a big contract and they were hoping he would play right field everyday well. Remember, he was only a year removed, back then, from his 17 hr 96 rbi season with the Marlins. It was worth of first mention in the article because it was one of the first interesting stories from that season (but of course not the last).\n\nAlso Derek Bell was the best hitter on the team for the first month of the season. I think he was hitting like .350-.400 for the first month. He was the bright spot at first for the team but then he died out.\n\nMike Hampton performed well enough throughout that series to win NLCS MVP. But I changed the wording just to make it sound better as you can check.\n\n-[[User:bootleg42|Bootleg42]] 22:06, 31 March 2006 (UTC)\n:Yeah, looks good enough to me.  I still don't agree about the Bonilla part - they acquired him for [[Mel Rojas]] who was just as bad at that point and getting paid almost as much.  To some extent, they were unloading one awful contract for another.  Maybe my recollection is hazy but I kinda remember getting exactly what I expected from Bonilla in '99.  But I won't split hairs to that degree.  \u2014[[User:wknight94|Wknight94]] ([[User talk:wknight94|talk]]) 00:52, 2 April 2006 (UTC)\n\n== Al Jackson (baseball) ==\n\n[[Al Jackson (baseball)]] is an orphan page.

After all, they only won the WS once in that period, and reached the playoffs only once more as well.\n\nIn any case, I think that that era, 1986-1990, should include 1984 and 1985.  It was that whole era from 1984-1990 that the Mets were competitive year in and year out.  The previous era, where they were in last place every year, extends over the period from 1977-1983 - starting with the Midnight Massacre and ending with the arrival of Darryl Strawberry.\n\nSo in any case, that's my proposal - 1977-1983 be one distinct era, and 1984-1990 be another one.--[[User:DaveOinSF|DaveOinSF]] 20:06, 9 May 2006 (UTC)\n\n:I think one of the biggest turning points in the arc of the club's history was the sale of the team by the Payson family after the 1979 season. I think it makes a lot of sense to end a section there and start a new one in 1980. I'd be more inclined to have the period from 1980 to 1990 be a section which started with Cashen's rebuilding and included the 1986 Series as well as the competitive years thereafter up until it all fell apart after 1990. [[User:Veronique|Veronique]] 21:03, 9 May 2006 (UTC)\n::I'm probably in the minority but I'd really like to see the championship as a section of its own.

The team's success on the field?  The general composition of the roster?  Putting the cutoff at 1979\/1980 because of the managment transition seems arbitrary, considering that several other eras are defined by other criteria, with the team's actual performance on the field being predominant. The eras as defined now:\n::*1962-1968 _Loveable Losers_ - Defined by performance\n::*1969 _Miracle Mets_ - Defined by performance\n::*1970-1979 _YaGottaBelieve and Midnight Massacre_ - Defined by team ownership\n::*1980-1985 _Cashen Rebuilds_ - Defined by team management\n::*1986-1990 _Champions Again_ - Defined by performance\n::*1991-1996 _Hardball Back and The Worst..._ - Defined by performance\n::*1997-2004 _Piazza Bobby V_ - Defined by composition of the roster\n::*2005- _Minaya takes the Reins_ - Defined by team managment\n\n::For a performance-based division, this would be my suggestion:\n::*1962-1968 Loveable Losers\n::*1969-1976 The Amazin' Mets\n::*1977-1983 ??\n::*1984-1990 Baseball Like it Oughta Be\n::*1991-1996 The Worst Team Money Could Buy\n::*1997-2001 ??

First, it isn't really totally performance-based as you suggested, since it draws a relationship between the payroll of the team and the performance on the field.  Second, 1996 does probably belong in that grouping of years as an era, by performance standards but it doesn't really belong under that title.  By 1996 the Mets had already long abandoned the strategy of signing over-the-hill free agents, and had stripped the team down to the point where it consisted of farmhands and cheap no-names.  In 1996 the Mets had the second lowest payroll in the NL to the Expos, and I believe it was low in 1995 as well.  The makeup of those teams resembles the later 1997 team more than it does the previous teams.\n\n:::1997-2001 could be \"A Return to Respectability\" or something along those lines.  Although you could make an argument that some of the elements that came forward to produce a good season in 1997 were present in 1995-1996 and belong more with the latter era than the earlier one of futility, as a stepping stone to the rebuild of the team after the disastrous early nineties.\n\n:::I agree with you that 2002-2004 or 2005 needs to be distinct from 1997-2001.  Although Valentine was there in 2002, I believe that Valentine's firing ushered in a new valley in franchise history and one that should be kept distinct from the previous era of good feeling.--[[User:Darren delgado|Darren delgado]] 00:12, 27 June 2006 (UTC)\n\n:::There's no standard definition of era.

I'm not saying I disagree, but I did want to bring up one point and see what people thought.\n\nIt seems to me that many of the people who read this page are reading to learn about the current team as well as the history.  While a guy like Darren Oliver might not go down as a great Met one day, right now he's important and mentioning his aquisition could be helpful knowledge to some readers.  Remember that these minor details can be removed at some point in the future as these players fade into relative obscurity.\n\nAlso, I think the arguement that its not consistent with the other sections isn't strong because there's no reason it has to be consistent.  For now, Julio Franco and Endy Chavez are much more important to mention than a George Stone or Kevin Elster.  While this article is supposed to give a general overview of Mets history, its main purpose is still to educate the readers in their area of interest.  If they are reading about the Mets right now, their interest is probably as much in the current team as it is in the general history.  Therefore, I think there is a strong case that these \"minor players\" of recent times should be worthy of mention.[[User:Ags412|Ags412]] 21:31, 5 August 2006 (UTC)\n:'''''You''''' say there's no reason to be consistent but I completely disagree.  While Endy Chavez is huge now, I've been a Mets fan since before '86 so people like Danny Heep and George Stone are just as important.  I've made a proposal in the past that would make us both happy - make articles for each individual season.  People could put an endless amount of detail about the [[2006 New York Mets]] while the [[1979 New York Mets]] could have their own article and possibly enjoy a similar level of detail if someone were so inclined.  The Minnesota Twins have some individual season articles and I like it.  \u2014[[User:wknight94|Wknight94]] ([[User talk:wknight94|talk]]) 21:41, 5 August 2006 (UTC)\n\nTo clarify, I said there's no reason it '''has''' to be consistent - i.e. no rule says it has to be.  \n\nRemember the recent stuff can stay for a year or so and the be removed when these players fizzle out.  When all is said and done, Stone and Heep will be as important figures in Mets history as Valentin or Oliver will be, but the people researching right now will benefit more having the recent stuff there than they would without the recent stuff.\n\nIf you desire consistency, maybe the trend on this page should be that teams have greater detail regarding recent movement as it is more likely to be helpful to readers.\n\nI agree too that adding new pages for every season would solve all these issues and encourage anyone with the time and interest to undertake this project.[[User:Ags412|Ags412]] 21:58, 5 August 2006 (UTC)\n\n:I would be very much in favor of a separate article for the current season.

The 1962, 1963 and 2006 links go nowhere. I'm all for re-adding this section if and when someone wants to step up and start pages that don't just redirect to pages that the article already links to.

A little history give or take some facts for those that want to look into it before it's added or don't know..Jason Isringhausen (aka Izzy), Bill Pulsiper and Paul Wilson were all the three cherished pitching rookies the Mets had that were supposed to be the next great thing since sliced bread. Of course as has happend a lot in my poor Mets history it didn't work out as hoped and only Izzy wound up becoming anything good and with another team none the less. It  happend in about 1996 I believe if someone wants to add the little bit about how the team was counting on these three prospects to revive the organization. The marketing campaign was used with the \"Generation K\" idea that they were so good they would strike everyone out. Things didn't work out at all as all three wound up getting injured and the Mets had a 71-91 season over all in 1996. All three eventualy wound up being traded. This is very similar to the Cubs using of Woods and Prior and how that never quite panned out to what they had hoped would happen.

Once the playoffs are over then whoever is going to tackle finalizing the results can go about that and all of the recentism stuff won't matter anyway. I say wait out the one day of up to date situations as it's easier then trying to undo every single game result put in. Just wait it out as Wikipedia does serve as a current events type of place for lots of people too. Whether that is right or wrong for people to use it in that way is another story all together.

Now, so as to not unecessarily clutter up the templates, it is hoped that only one nickname be used for each.  Many teams have multiple nicknames, but only the most prominant should be used.  That being said, isn't the \"Miracle Mets\" a nickname that refers to a specific team (I believe the '69 Mets), rather than the team through the years?  The Amazin's seems to be used to refer to a much broader time frame.  The same discussion took place over the nickname \"Murderer's Row\", which refers primarily with the '27 Yankees, and it seems this may be the same situation.  Of course, this may not be the case.  Go ahead and discuss it here, along with any other nicknames they may have, and choose which one you'd prefer to put in the spot.  In the meantime, I'll revert to just the \"Amazin's\".

There is speculation that former owner Joan Whitney Payson wanted to have number 24 retired right after Willie called it a career, but never got around to issuing an official order to do so.  This has been a subject of debate among Met fans.

The National league did not expand into New York; the Mets filled the void created in the National League when the Giant and Dodgers abandoned New York.\"\n\nI do not think it is conjecture; rather it is bare fact.

I've heard Ralph Kiner alone say that phrase thousands of times. You do know who Ralph Kiner is, don't you? However, while that use of the phrase is purely celebratory, the origin of the phrase is not, and comes from \"the old professor,\" Casey Stengel, the Mets' first manager. The first Mets team was so bad that Casey said, among other things, \"Can't anybody here play this game?\" and \"They're amazin.'\" I am not enough of a Casey Stengel scholar to know whether Stengel was being ironic, or if this was simply a case of \"Stengelese,\" and he didn't know the proper word, or didn't know a non-cuss word to use to describe his team's hopeless level of play.\n\nBut here's my beef.\n\n\"The 'Mets' name originates from the New York Metropolitans, an 1880s baseball club. They are nicknamed the \"Amazin' Mets\",[1] or simply the \"Amazin's\"[1] or 'Metropolitans'.\"\n\nNo one under the age of 80 calls them the \"Metropolitans,\" and I don't think even Ralph Kiner has called them that in years.

This is false and should be removed.\n[[User:Nbc7|Nbc7]] ([[User talk:Nbc7|talk]]) 02:08, 3 June 2009 (UTC)\n\n== Expansion teams in World Series ==\n\nThe statement \"The Mets have appeared in more World Series \u2014 four \u2014 than any other expansion team in Major League Baseball history\" is a valid statement on its own. There is no need to add a \"since WWII\" qualifier. At the time the Series began, in 1903, there were 16 MLB teams. Since then, MLB has expanded several times. Now, if the Series had begun in 1900, then the original 8 of the AL could be argued to be expansion teams. But such is not the case, and historians don't talk about the original 8 AL as being \"expansion teams\" in reference to the Series.

The article has reached 80kb in size, and thus the history section should be split out. Basically, what's needed is someone to write short summaries of the major sections, and then the whole \"Franchise history\" section can be copied and pasted into the new article.

With minor changes, this pattern persists throughout the entire song. The five-note, 3+3+4+3+3 pattern is visible.\n    |Source= Own Work\n    |Date= 2006-12-27\n    |Author= Matthew D. Thibeault\n    |Permission= Creative Commons, Attribution ShareAlike 2.5\n    }}\n\n== Licensing ==\n{{cc-by-sa-2.5}}\n\n==Comment and Extension==\n\nThe displayed rhythm is correct (verified by measuring, with audio software, time distances between the notes in the original song).  However, the 16\/8 meter does not account for (a) the phrasing of the song's lyrics, (b) the stress pattern of drums, bass, and other instruments, and (c) the piano's chord changes (especially in the F#min -- E9 section).  A pattern of 6\/8, 10\/8, 10\/8, 6\/8 appears to account for those additional features. Here is an attempt to display the relationship between chords, bars, and lyrics: http:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Image:Pyramid_meter.jpg\n<p>\n\nI agree that the 16\/8 meter does not work.  That would mean that there are 16 beats per bar, with the 8th note getting one count.  This is clearly not the case.  The note values in the figure on this page do work if counted in an x\/4 meter (with the quarter note getting one count), but that does not explain the phrasing whatsoever.  It's true that stress patterns and phrasing must be taken into account, however, the pattern shown in foregoing link which tries to account for all of these doesn't posit any meter, it just tries to squeeze 16 counts into each phrase with no indication of note values.  My version does take all these things into account, and results in: 3\/4-2\/4-3\/4 which is repeated over and over.  Listen to things like the kick drum (which drummers will almost always place on the 1), as well as when the chords change.   The overall pattern is almost chiastic, or rather a mirror image of itself.  3-2-3 \/ 3-2-3 \/\/ 3-2-3 \/ 3-2-3 although, admittedly, calling it a chiasmus is possibly a stretch.  Then again, chiasmus is often somewhat veiled, making it hard to pin down, but that's another topic.\n\n{{Orphan image}}\n\n{{Copy to Wikimedia Commons|bot=Fbot}}","timestamp":"20160410095940","user-timestamp":"20150410095940"},{"title":"File:IstanbulBosphorusBridge.jpg","content":"== Summary ==\n{{Information\n|Description= Bosphorus Bridge at night\n|Source=I created this work entirely by myself.\n|Date= 17.07.2008\n|Author=[[User:Aegean Boy|Aegean Boy]] ([[User talk:Aegean Boy|talk]])\n|other_versions=\n}}\n== Licensing: ==\n{{PD-self|date=July 2008}}\n\n{{Orphan image}}\n\n{{Copy to Wikimedia Commons|bot=Fbot|date=March 2012}}","timestamp":"20160410095941","user-timestamp":"20150410095941"},{"title":"University of Utah Circle","content":"{{Infobox NRHP \n  | name =University of Utah Circle\n  | nrhp_type = hd  | nocat = yes  \n  | image = Original U of U library.jpg\n  | caption = The LeRoy Cowles Building in 1905.\n  | location= [[Salt Lake City, Utah]]\n  | lat_degrees = 40\n  | lat_minutes = 45\n  | lat_seconds = 54\n  | lat_direction = N\n  | long_degrees = 111\n  | long_minutes = 50\n  | long_seconds = 59\n  | long_direction = W\n  | locmapin = Utah\n  | area =\n  | built = 1901 - 1935\n  | architect= Multiple (Richard Kletting;<ref name=\"cowles\"\/> [[Cannon, Fetzer, Hansen]];<ref name=\"park\"\/> Ashton & Evans<ref name=\"gardner\"\/>)\n  | architecture= \n  | added = 1978<ref name=\"register\">{{NRISref|2009a}}<\/ref>\n  | governing_body = \n  | mpsub=\n  | refnum= 78002682\n}}\nThe ''' University of Utah Circle''', also known as '''Presidents Circle''',  is located on the campus of the [[University of Utah]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]].

He has also acted in [[Malgudi Days (TV series)|Malgudi Days]], directed by his younger brother [[Shankar Nag]] based on the stories by [[R. K. Narayan]]. His work was much appreciated by critics at that time. He is fluent in [[Kannada]], [[Konkani language|Konkani]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Hindi]]. The versatile natural acting coupled with the style of speaking (southern Kannada accent with a coastal touch) made him one of the most successful actors in Kannada cinema.{{Citation needed|date = July 2013}}\n\n==Early life==\nAnant Nag was born on 4 September 1948 to Anandi and Sadanand Nagarkatte in the Chowpatty suburb of [[Bombay]] (now Mumbai), in the erstwhile [[Bombay State|Bombay Province]] (now a part of [[Maharashtra]] State) of the [[Dominion of India]].<ref>{{cite AV media|people=Nag, Anant|date=5 March 2016|title=Weekend with Ramesh Season 2 - Episode 21 - March 05, 2016|language=Kannada|url=http:\/\/www.ozee.com\/shows\/weekend-with-ramesh-season2\/video\/weekend-with-ramesh-season-2-episode-21-march-5-2016-full-episode.html|accessdate=6 March 2016|publisher=Zee Kannada}}<\/ref> Born into a [[Konkani language|Konkani]]-speaking family, his family settled in [[Shirali]], a village near [[Bhatkal]] in [[Uttara Kannada]] of [[Karnataka]] State. He had an older sister, Shyamala, and a younger brother, [[Shankar Nag|Shankar]].\n\nAnant had his early education under the aegis of Ananda Ashrama in [[Dakshina Kannada]] district and [[Chitrapur Math]] in [[Uttara Kannada]] district of the erstwhile [[Mysore State]] (now [[Karnataka]]). After class 7, he was sent to [[Bombay]] (now Mumbai) for further education where he studied till class 11. This was when he was drawn towards the theatre movement of Bombay and he was selected to act in Konkani, Kannada and Marathi-language plays which he did until he turned 22.<ref name=\"Nag\" \/>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Theatre===\nOnce in Bombay, thanks to his good looks, he was suggested by [[theatre]] personalities Prabhakar Mudur and Venkatrao Talageri to participate in theatrical plays. His first role came in a play when he played the role of a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] monk, [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]], that proved to be a success among the audiences. He then played a role in a play based on the life of sage [[Gautama Buddha]]. Following these, he played important roles in plays in [[Konkani language|Konkani]] and [[Kannada language]]s, the latter mostly with directors K. K. Suvarna and [[Girish Karnad]]. In Karnad's play ''Yayati'', Nag played the role of Pururava. He also played major roles in [[Hindi language]] plays of [[Amol Palekar]] and [[Satyadev Dubey]]'s socially and politically relevant plays. Around this time, in the early 1970s, he received two film offers, in P. V. Nanjaraja Urs' Kannada film, ''Sankalpa''; and [[Shyam Benegal]]'s Hindi film, ''[[Ankur (film)|Ankur]]''.<ref>{{cite AV media|people=Nag, Anant|date=11 November 2014|title=TV9 - Actor Anant Nag's Film & Life History : \"Anant Antaranga\" - Part 2|url=http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YGpcR3O7nqg|location=India|publisher=TV9 Kannada}}<\/ref><ref name=\"Nag\" \/>\n\n===Film career===\nFollowing a theatre career in Bombay, Nag made his film debut with ''Sankalpa'' a 1973 Kannada film. [[Shyam Benegal]] introduced him into Hindi cinema in his 1973 film ''[[Ankur (film)|Ankur]]''. Anant Nag acted in many of Shyam Benegal's movies after that. Although he is well known for his mainstream Kannada films, Nag is also active in alternative Indian cinema.\n\nHis entry into Kannada films was through legendary [[G. V. Iyer]]'s ''[[Hamsageethe]]''.<ref>[http:\/\/www.chitraranga.com\/en\/profiles\/ananthanag.asp Anant Nag's profile on Chitraranga]<\/ref> It is one of the most critically acclaimed of his movies and is about trysts of a learner whose greatest search is finding the right Guru.<ref>https:\/\/filestubealternative.wordpress.com\/<\/ref>\n\nNag and fellow popular actress [[Lakshmi (actress)|Lakshmi]] have been known as an all-time greatest pair in South Indian movies. They acted together in more than 25 films. Most of the films based on [[T. R. Subba Rao]]'s novels and some of them directed by great [[S.K Bhagavan|Dorai-Bhagavan]]. The films like ''Chandanada Gombe, Naa Ninna Bidaalare (1979), Benkiya Bale, Ibbani Karagitu, Makkaliralavva Mane Thumba, Mududida Taavare Aralitu, Amma'' and others in their combination were blockbuster hits that made Anant Nag and Lakshmi household names in Karnataka. Both the actors have signed a new film together in 2013 called \"Gulmohar\" directed by Devanuru Chandra that has already started shooting.\n\nAlthough he began his career as an actor in artistic movies, became most popular in comedies due to his versatile acting and natural sense of humour. Ananth Nag kept re-inventing himself with each era. In the 1970s and 80s, he was the darling of the middle-class with his natural acting. He also dabbled in television during this period. In the 90s, he experimented with negative roles (''[[Shanti Kranti]]'') and accepted character roles.\n\nHe is one among very few lead actors in Kannada film industry to share screen space with [[Rajkumar (actor)|Rajkumar]]. Most memorable of this combination is Kaamana Billu, in which he played second lead role. Another notable film is Bhakta Prahlada, in which Rajkumar played Hiranya Kashyapu and Ananthnag as Naradamuni.\n\nWith greatest hits in the films like ''[[Ganeshana Maduve]]'', ''[[Gauri Ganesha]]'', ''Udbava'', ''Undoohoda Konduhoda'', ''[[Beladingala Baale]]'', ''[[Hasyaratna Ramakrishna]]'', ''[[Yarigu Helbedi]]'', ''dairya lakshmi'', he has been noted for his abilities. These days, he appears in supporting roles in [[Kannada]] movies (for example, blockbuster films like ''[[Mungaru Male]]''): He has been the favourite choice of most popular directors of Kannada cinema. He is equally popular in supportive roles amongst dignified viewers across the [[Karnataka]]. His recent movie ''Eredane maduve'' has been a huge hit where he acted in a lead role with Suhasini Maniratnam.\n\nNag acted in ''[[Anahat (film)|Anahat]]'' and it drew rave reviews. Marathi film director Amol Palekar found Nag's sensitive depiction of the king's dilemmas to have greatly enhanced the multifaceted complexities of the film.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} The character portrayed by Nag has depth and dimension, powerfully drawing you into the core of the story.\n\nThough he is one of the most influential men both from a film and political point of view, he has often been regarded as the finest, the simplest and polite personality. His appearance in front of media or appearances for publicity have hardly been noticed and the association of his name with any controversy has hardly been reported, either with his film or with political career. For these reasons, Nag is considered as one of the most respectable personalities in the real life. Now he is one of the most sought-after actor in [[Kannada]] cinemas.{{Citation needed|date = July 2013}}\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1979, Nag was shooting for ''Narada Vijaya'' and [[Gayatri (actress)|Gayatri]] for ''[[Auto Raja]]'' with [[Shankar Nag]] in Chamundeshwari studios. With time, cupid struck and love blossomed between them. They married on 9 April 1987.<ref>{{cite web |title= About real life and reel lives |url= http:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/city\/bangalore\/About-real-life-and-reel-lives\/articleshow\/6765949.cms |publisher= ''The Times of India'' |date= October 2010 |accessdate= 9 March 2014}}<\/ref> They have a daughter, Aditi.\n\n==Political career==\nStaying in Mumbai, in the heady days of Socialism, Anant Nag was a strong supporter of the reformist movement. He identified himself with the Janatha Party and was the star-campaigner for Janatha Party in 1983, 1985 and 1989 elections. He won from [[Malleshwaram]] constituency in 1994 and served as a Minister for [[Bangalore Development Authority|BDA]] in the [[J. H. Patel]]'s cabinet. Much before he also contested from Uttara Kannada Lok Sabha constituency in 1983 against veteran writer K. Shivarama Karanth.\nHis tenure was uneventful, with him being criticised for not catering the infrastructure needs of [[Bangalore]].{{Citation needed|date = July 2013}}\n\nWhen [[Ramakrishna Hegde]], supposedly his mentor was expelled from Janatha Dal, he stayed within Janatha Dal, leading to speculations of divide between the two.{{Citation needed|date = July 2013}}\n\nIn 2004, he contested a very fierce [[Deliberative assembly|assembly]] election from [[Janata Dal (Secular)]] where he was pitched against the then [[Chief minister]] of Karnataka, [[S. M. Krishna]] from [[Indian National Congress]], alongside fellow actor [[Mukhyamantri Chandru]] from [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] in the Chamrajpet constituency in [[Bangalore]]. However, [[S.M. Krishna]] won the election. But Krishna, disappointed with not being able to win the majority, opted not to lead the party and soon became the governor of [[Maharashtra]].\n\n==Filmography==\n{{Main|Anant Nag filmography}}\n\n==Awards==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ [[Karnataka State Film Awards]]\n!Year !!Award type !!

I think that Terra Linda is notable, for a neighborhood, due to the concentration of Eichlers alone.  I'll add something about the Las Gallinas Valley Sanitary District and the \"Sewer Band\" later.  --[[User:Hjal|Hjal]] 08:27, 9 November 2006 (UTC)\n\n:I cut the big text block into chapters. As for James Hetfield, I'm dubious about him being a Terra Linda resident - his house is over the ridge from the neighborhood and his driveway goes down to Lucas Valley Road.  Tempted to delete. \n\n:Overall, the article needs work. I agree that the Eichler houses are notable, they were subject of a well-documented, successful effort to ban the construction of second stories on them on 2003.

Please see [[Wikipedia:Stub#Essential information about stubs|Wikipedia:Stub]] for our minimum information standards for short articles. Also please note that articles must be on [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] subjects and should provide references to [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]] that [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verify]] their content. You may wish to consider using a Wizard to help you create articles - see the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard2.0|Article Wizard]]. \n\nIf you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding <code>{{tl|hangon}}<\/code> to '''the top of [[:Teccomza|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion or \"db\" tag - if no such tag exists then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hangon tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Teccomza|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

The captives were initially held in the open, but a panic ensued in November 1863 when 800 new prisoners threatened a mass breakout.  A military [[stockade]] enclosing {{convert|4|acre|m2}} was soon erected.<ref name=\"Handbook\"\/>\n\n[[Image:19th-iowa-nco-prisoners.jpg|265px|right|thumb|19th Iowa Infantry, exchanged prisoners.]]\nWith over 2,000 new prisoners taken in [[Louisiana]] on April 8 and 9 1864, at the battles of [[Battle of Mansfield|Mansfield]], and [[Battle of Pleasant Hill|Pleasant Hill]], the stockade was quadrupled in size. With more prisoners captured in [[Arkansas]], the prison's population peaked at about 5,000 in July 1864. The population was reduced by exchanges in July and October 1864,<ref name=\"Handbook\"\/> and again in February 1865. The last 1,761 prisoners were exchanged on May 22, 1865.<ref name=\"A Short History of Camp Ford\"\/>\n\n''' Summary Executions of Local Citizens, Recounted by 49th Ohio prisoners at Camp Ford: From \"Twenty Months in the Dept of the Gulf\", A.G.H. DuGanne''' \"Among the last-mentioned local events, however, was the \"Match Plot,\" which deserves a paragraph\".\n\n\"The breaking out of fires in several stores, at Tyler and other places, awakened a suspicion that two merchants from the Northern States, (who had purchased patent matches, which ignited almost spontaneously,) were incendiaries\". \"The usual senseless hue and cry followed; the traders were thrown into prison; and hundreds of hapless blacks were arrested and tortured -- in order to get evidence of the \"Yankee Conspiracy.\" \"Free negros and poor white settlers from the North fell under the ban at once. Scores of the latter were hanged by the mob\". \"More than a hundred negros, free and bond, were executed, as I have been informed, on suspicion alone\". \"Several were burned at the stake\". \"Thirty white and free men were lynched, in and about Tyler and Palestine; one of the unfortunate merchants who had introduced the matches undergoing this fate -- the other escaping by timely flight\". \"Blood flowed in all quarters, till the enlightened \"Regulators,\" finding no more poor whites to kill or banish, decided that \"order reigned\" again\".\n\n\"Burning men and women at the stake is a relic of aboriginal amusement\". \"A negro was thus executed at Tyler, while our prisoners tarried at Camp Ford\". \"The occasion furnished a gala-day for all the good people of Smith County, our guards included\".\n\n\"I heard one day a story of lynch-law executed in our camp neighborhood; my informant being a friendly guard, who, like many others, was Union at heart, although conforming outwardly to rebel service, as a volunteer\".\n\n\"During the winter, an old lady, living in Van Zandt County, was plundered by a gang of soldiers in Confederate grey, who beat her shamefully, and (as she told the story,) tied her up by her thumbs till she disclosed the place where was concealed her specie (some three hundred dollars) and about two thousand dollars in Confederate currency\". \"It was asserted that Jayhawkers had done this deed, though sober people shook their heads; well knowing that squads of Sibley's men, with some of Richardson's guerillas, and the scattered miscreants of Quantrell's gang, were ranging through these upper counties\". \"But \"black flag\" rebels charged the crime, as they would any crime, on Union men\u2014of whom hundreds, former citizens, were fugitives in swamps and timber, hiding from conscript hunters\". \"It was easy to accuse such outlawed wanderers; so the chase became set after \"Union men.\" Four individuals were speedily run down: one Reed, a former sheriff of Collin County; an aged citizen, McReynolds, or McRunnells, who bad been chief-justice of that district; and two young men, Holcombe and Davis\". \"They were arrested at their homes and dragged to Tyler\".\n\n\"This was in May, when our prison-numbers, at Camp Ford, had been increased some thousands, after the battle of Mansfield. The rebels were exultant everywhere, but with characteristic cowardice the people of these counties feared an outbreak from so large a body of incarcerated Yankees, and affected to discover insurrectionary plots continually\". \"Three noble-hearted Texans, who refused to bow the knee to Davis, were imprisoned in our guardhouse at Camp Ford -- two brothers, Whitmore, one of whom had been a prominent member of the Legislature, and Rosenbaum, a former attorney-general of the state\". \"It was the policy of rank Secessionists to fix as many new crimes on the Union men as could be believed, in order that some pretext might be found for general massacre or the enacting of terror laws\".\n\n\"Hence, when Sheriff Reed and Judge McReynolds were thrown into prison at Tyler, it was decided that they should never go at large again\". \"So, one May morning, fifty mounted \"Regulators\" clattered into Tyler, halted at the tavern door, and \"liquored round;\" held confab with the provost-marshal, galloped up and down the town awhile, and finally drew rein before the prison, with a yell\":\n\n\"Bring out them Jayhawkers!\"\n\n\"The doors were opened, and the men delivered up\". \"A rope being slung about them, they were dragged behind the Lynchers to a piece of timber, scarce half a mile out of Tyler\". \"There, almost within gun-shot of camps, where fifteen hundred cavalry and infantry were guarding Federal prisoners, these Lynchers began their mockery of a trial\". \"The first victim pleaded \"not guilty.\"\n\n\"You lie, Jim Reed! You're a heap wuss Jayhawker than Gineral Banks!\"\n\n\"Silence in the coort!\" cries Justice Lynch, a bullheaded whiskey-still proprietor\". \"Keep still, you all, while I fix his flint\". \"Prisoner, Jim Reed, what have you got to say why you oughtn't to be black-jacked?\"\n\nREED. -- \"I am not guilty. I've been hunted and persecuted for my sentiments ever since the State seceded. I never fought against the State. My house was burned over the heads of my family in the town where I lived, an honest man, and served the country\". \"I had to fly, by night, with my wife and seven children, to Van Zandt, and they hounded me out of that\". \"I declare before Heaven that\"\u2014LYNCH, C. J. -- Shet up! You know yer an old scoundrel, and yer was three ye'rs in Missouri Penitentiary\u2014REED\u2014I never was in the State of Missouri.\n\nLYNCH, C. J. -- Blast yer, then, yer an old deserter from General McCulloch's army. The papers was found on ye, and yer can't swar 'em down.\n\nREED. -- I deny it. I was regularly commissioned by General McCulloch, as an officer. He gave me a position because I preferred to go back to the army rather than be hunted down. I was preparing to join my command when arrested.\n\nLYNCH, C. J. -- Yer a skulkin' liar and a thief, Jim Reed, and we've jest had palaver enough out o' yer. I pronounce judgment of the coort. Yer to be hanged at once, till yer dead, dead, dead! and Lord have marcy on yer soul!\n\n\"Five minutes after, Sheriff Reed was dangling from an oak-limb above his murderers\".\n\n\"Judge McReynolds was then dragged forward and reviled by the \"coort\" in like manner\". \"The old man's son, who was one of the rebel soldiers guarding us at Camp Ford, heard about the Lynchers visiting Tyler jail, and, mounting a horse, galloped from his quarters to the town\". \"He there learned that the ruffians bad taken their prisoners to the woods\". \"He followed their trail with all the speed he could command, but arrived in time only to find his father swinging on the tree, from which Reed's dead body had been just cut down\". \"This wretched son was forced to beg the remains of his parent from the assassins; and so great was the terror inspired by the boldness and cruelty of these \"Regulators,\" that young McReynolds was unable to hire a wagon to convey the corpse to Kaufman county, where his family lived\".\n\n\"Young Holcombe -- like each of the others -- stoutly maintained his innocence, and was hanged with the same noose that had strangled his predecessors; for the ruffians had provided only rope enough to hang a single man; and were obliged to wait until one was dead before proceeding to execute another\".\n\nDuring the course of the war, the total number of prisoners who passed through the camp was slightly more than 5,500.  About 327 prisoners died in captivity, giving the camp a mortality rate of 5.9%, one of the lowest of any Civil War prison.  The deceased prisoners were reinterred to the Pineville, Louisiana, National Cemetery in 1867.<ref name=\"A Short History of Camp Ford\"\/>\n\n==Historic Park==\n\nThe original site of the Camp stockade is now a public historic park, owned by [[Smith County, Texas]], and managed by the Smith County Historical Society, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded in 1959 by individuals and business firms dedicated to discovering, collecting and preserving data, records and other items relating to the history of Smith County.

My name is Ryan, aka [[User:Acetic Acid|Acetic Acid]]. I noticed that you were new and haven't received any messages yet. I just wanted to see how you were doing. Wikipedia can be a little intimidating at first, since it uses different formatting than other sites that use [[HTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]]. In the long run, though, you'll find that the WikiSyntax is a lot easier and faster than those other ways. Here are a few links to get you started:\n\n*[[Wikipedia:How to edit a page|How to edit a page]]\n*[[Wikipedia:Tutorial|Editing, policy, conduct, and structure tutorial]]\n*[[Wikipedia:Picture tutorial|Picture tutorial]]\n*[[Wikipedia:How to write a great article|How to write a great article]]\n\nThere are a lot of policies and guides to read, but I highly recommend reading over those first. If you have any questions, feel free to leave me a message on my [[User Talk:Acetic Acid|talk page]]. Please be sure to [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|sign your name on Talk Pages]] using four tildes (&#126;&#126;&#126;&#126;) to produce your name and the current date, along with a link to your user page. This way, others know when you left a message and how to find you. It's easier than having to type out your name, right? :)\n\nI hope you enjoy contributing to Wikipedia. We can use all the help we can get! Have a nice day.\nSincerely, [[User:Acetic Acid|Ryan]]. 13:01, August 2, 2005 (UTC)\n\n==Non-free use disputed for Image:Cultura.jpg==\n\n{| align=\"center\" style=\"background-color: white; border:8px solid red; padding:5px; text-align: center; font-size: larger;\"\n|[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|30px|Warning sign]]\n|This file may be '''deleted'''.\n|}\nThanks for uploading '''[[:Image:Cultura.jpg]]'''.

To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Battisti~enwiki that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]]. If you think you might own all of the accounts with this name and this message is in error, please visit [[Special:MergeAccount]] to check and attach all of your accounts to prevent them from being renamed.\n\nYour account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.\n\nSorry for the inconvenience.\n\nYours,<br \/>[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]<br \/>Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation\n<\/div> 22:25, 19 March 2015 (UTC)\n<!-- SUL finalisation notification -->\n\n== Renamed ==\n\n<div class=\"plainlinks mw-content-ltr\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\u201d>\nThis account has been renamed as part of [[m:Special:MyLanguage\/Single User Login finalisation announcement|single-user login finalisation]].

In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags\/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with [[WP:FU|fair use]].\n\nPlease go to [[:Image:Unian.jpg|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.

He moved to America in 1964 to continue his schooling, followed by undergraduate studies at the College of\nLetters, Wesleyan University.\n\nIt was during his studies that his early interest in art was developed by Professor SamuelGreen, an accomplished watercolourist and Professor of Art History at Wesleyan University.\nThey first met in 1964 in Banjul, while the Professor was there on sabbatical. Ceesay developed his watercolour techniques from watching the Professor work and acquired a\nlifetime commitment to using the highest quality art materials.\n\nAs part of his degree programme Ceesay also spent a year in France, continuing his studies at the University de Poitiers (Tours) and La Sorbonne (Paris). There, he was strongly\ninfluenced by his experiences of seeing the originals of Picasso as well as by the student riots. The cries for freedom were everywhere, and on his return he found the same wind\nof change blowing in America. He moved to a Black House which had been set up by his student colleagues at the University. While there he met Clifford Thornton, a teacher at\nWesleyan and also a member of the Black Panthers.\n\n1970-1976: American Beginnings\nAfter graduating with a BA in General Studies in 1970, Ceesay moved to Boston to study Electronic Engineering. At this time he also began studying martial arts which he found\nbrought not only discipline but also enhanced his creative spiritual process, bringing an open meditative state and the ability to function within a stream of consciousness, a\nphilosophy Ceesay continues to maintain in his artwork. In 1971 Ceesay decided to leave his electronic engineering studies to devote himself full-time to art. He began teaching at the Elma Lewis School of Fine Arts where he learned the art of silk screening under Oolong Smith.\n\nIn 1972, responding to an invitation from Edmund Barry Gaither, The Director of the National Centre of African American Artists, Ceesay participated in the exhibition \u2018Kindred Spirits\u2019, which included works by the renowned African-American artist Charles White and the Nigerian artist Chief Z.K. Olaruntuba.\n\nIn the following year, 1973, Ceesay moved to Los Angeles where he set up a screen printing studio and by 1976 was travelling widely to attend artist residencies and\nexhibitions around the world, including Columbia, Taiwan, Yugoslavia and Nigeria. His work was recognised and collected by investors and major Corporations alike.\n\n1977-1983: Establishing African Roots\nIn 1977 Ceesay returned to The Gambia. He set up the Kayor Art Gallery exhibiting the works of Gambian and Senegalese artists. He provided design and illustrations for\nGovernment and Academic publications, and produced the first billboards in The Gambia through his own Media Agency.\n\nCeesay\u2019s\u00a0early\u00a0education\u00a0was\u00a0in\u00a0The\u00a0Gambia\u00a0followed\u00a0by\u00a0scholarships\u00a0and\u00a0academic\u00a0studies\u00a0at\u00a0Suffield\u00a0\nAcademy\u00a0and\u00a0Wesleyan\u00a0University,\u00a0Connecticut\u00a0(USA).\u00a0He\u00a0continued\u00a0his\u00a0studies\u00a0in\u00a0France\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0University\u00a0de\u00a0Poitiers,\u00a0Tours\u00a0and\u00a0La\u00a0Sorbonne,\u00a0Paris.\n\nFollowing\u00a0his\u00a0academic\u00a0studies,\u00a0Ceesay\u00a0chose\u00a0to\u00a0pursue\u00a0a\u00a0career\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0fine\u00a0artist.\u00a0His\u00a0highly\u00a0individualistic\u00a0vision\u00a0is\u00a0reflected\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0uniqueness\u00a0of\u00a0his\u00a0style\u00a0and\u00a0use\u00a0of\u00a0color.\u00a0This\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0seen\u00a0across\u00a0the\u00a0variety\u00a0of\u00a0media\u00a0and\u00a0\nmethods\u00a0he\u00a0employs.\n\n\u2018My\u00a0art\u00a0is\u00a0an\u00a0exploration\u00a0of\u00a0images\u00a0rooted\u00a0in\u00a0my\u00a0culture\u00a0and\u00a0heritage\u00a0that\u00a0take\u00a0the\u00a0viewer\u00a0on\u00a0a\u00a0spiritual\u00a0\nodyssey...\u2019\u00a0MOMODOU\u00a0CEESAY","timestamp":"20160410100009","user-timestamp":"20150410100009"},{"title":"User talk:2602:252:D4F:CFD0:ACE2:DDB9:C846:728D","content":"== March 2015 ==\n\n[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=Information icon]] Hello, I'm [[User:Optakeover|Optakeover]].

It is a common occurrence along coasts during the morning as [[solar radiation]] heats the land more quickly than the water. A '''land breeze''' or '''offshore breeze''' is the reverse effect, caused by land cooling more quickly than water in the evening. The sea breeze dissipates and the wind flows from the land towards the sea. Both are important factors in coastal regions' [[prevailing winds]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Dr. Steve Ackerman|year=1995|url=http:\/\/cimss.ssec.wisc.edu\/wxwise\/seabrz.html|title=Sea and Land Breezes|publisher=[[University of Wisconsin]]|accessdate=2006-10-24}}<\/ref>\n\n'''Offshore wind''' refers more generally to any wind over open water. [[Offshore wind farm]]s take advantage of the higher [[wind speed]]s available over [[the sea]], but are usually placed near coasts to reduce costs and to take advantage of daily flows of sea and land breezes. [[Nearshore wind farm]]s are those closest to land, while others are further out to sea.\n\n==Cause==\nThe sea has a greater [[heat capacity]] than land, so the surface of the sea warms up more slowly than the land's surface.<ref>University of Wisconsin. [http:\/\/cimss.ssec.wisc.edu\/wxwise\/seabrz.html Sea and Land Breezes.] Retrieved on 2006-10-24.<\/ref> As the temperature of the surface of the [[landform|land]] rises, the land heats the air above it by [[Thermal conduction|conduction]].  The warm air is less dense and so it expands, decreasing the pressure over the land near the coast. The air above the sea has a relatively higher pressure, causing air near the coast to flow towards the lower pressure over land.  The strength of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the land and the sea.  If a strong offshore wind is present, that is, a wind greater than {{convert|sp=us|8|kn|km\/h}} and opposing the direction of a possible sea breeze, the sea breeze is not likely to develop.<ref name=\"Jet\"\/>\n\n==Effects==\n[[Image:SeaBreeze.svg|thumb|right|441px|Schematic cross section through a sea-breeze front. If the air inland is moist, cumulus often marks the front.]]\nA '''sea-breeze front''' is a [[weather front]] created by a sea breeze, also known as a [[convergence zone]].  The cold air from the sea meets the warmer air from the land and creates a boundary like a shallow [[cold front]].  When powerful this front creates [[cumulus cloud|cumulus]] clouds, and if the air is [[humid]] and [[unstable]], [[cumulonimbus cloud|cumulonimbus]] clouds, the front can sometimes trigger [[thunderstorm]]s.  If the flow aloft is aligned with the direction of the sea breeze, places experiencing the sea breeze frontal passage will be benign, or fair, weather for the remainder of the day.  At the front warm air continues to flow upward and cold air continually moves in to replace it and so the front moves progressively inland.  Its speed depends on whether it is assisted or hampered by the prevailing wind, and the strength of the thermal contrast between land and sea.  At night, the sea breeze usually changes to a land breeze, due to a reversal of the same mechanisms.\n\n===Sea breezes in Florida===\n{{seealso|Climate of Florida}}\n[[Image:Cubanseabreezeconvergence.gif|thumb|right|250px|Sea breeze convergence in [[Cuba]] is very similar to that in [[Florida]]. The northern sea breeze meets the southern sea breeze, creating a sharp convergence line in the [[Cumulus cloud|cumulus]] field.]]\n\nThunderstorms caused by powerful sea breeze fronts frequently occur in [[Florida]], a [[peninsula]] surrounded on both the east and west by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and [[Gulf of Mexico]], respectively.  During the wet season which typically lasts from June through September\/October, any direction that the winds are blowing would always be off the water, thus making Florida the place most often struck by [[lightning]] in the [[United States]], and one of the most on Earth. <ref>[http:\/\/www.lightning.ece.ufl.edu\/ Lightning Research Laboratory (UF)]. Lightning.ece.ufl.edu. Retrieved on 2009-02-06.<\/ref> These storms also can produce significant [[hail]] due to the tremendous [[updraft]] it causes in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] especially during times when the upper atmosphere is cooler such as during the spring or fall.\n\nOn calm summer afternoons with little prevailing wind, sea breezes from both coasts may collide in the middle, creating especially severe storms down the center of the state. These thunderstorms can drift towards either the west or east coast depending on the relative strengths of the sea breezes, and sometimes survive to move out over the water at night, creating spectacular cloud-to-cloud lightning shows for hours after sunset. <ref>Winsberg, Morton (2003). Florida Weather. Gainesville: University Press of Florida. ISBN 0-8130-2684-9.<\/ref><ref>Henry, James (1998). The Climate and Weather of Florida. Sarasota, Florida: Pineapple Press (FL). ISBN 1-56164-036-0.<\/ref>\n\n==Land breeze==\nAt night, the land cools off faster than the ocean due to differences in their heat capacity, which forces the dying of the daytime sea breeze as the temperature of the land approaches that of the ocean. If the land becomes cooler than the adjacent [[sea surface temperature]], the air pressure over the water will be lower than that of the land, setting up a land breeze blowing from the land to the sea, as long as the environmental surface wind pattern is not strong enough to oppose it. If there is sufficient moisture and instability available, the land breeze can cause showers, or even thunderstorms, over the water. Overnight thunderstorm development offshore due to the land breeze can be a good predictor for the activity on land the following day, as long as there are no expected changes to the weather pattern over the following 12\u201324 hours. This is mainly because the strength of the land breeze is weaker than the sea breeze.<ref name=\"Jet\">JetStream:  An Online School For Weather (2008).

The wetter stream area at the bottom supports [[ramsons]] and [[golden-saxifrage]]. The more marshy areas support [[forget-me-not]], [[brooklime]] and [[marsh-marigold]].<ref name=\"GWT nature reserves handbook\"\/> ferns are also present such as [[hart's-tongue]].<ref name=\"Snows Farm\"\/>\n\nThe ground flora in the woodland at the top of the west slope includes [[moschatel]], [[spurge-laurel]] and [[anemone nemorosa|wood anemone]].  The uncommon fingered [[Carex|sedge]] (''[[Carex digitata]]'') is present.<ref name=\"GWT nature reserves handbook\"\/> Over 300 plant species are recorded for this site.<ref name=\"Snows Farm\"\/>\n\n==Trees and scrub==\nThe scrub includes [[dog-rose]], [[field-rose]], [[Crataegus monogyna|hawthorn]], [[dogwood]] and there are [[wayfaring-tree]]s. [[Alder]], [[white willow]], [[Fraxinus excelsior|ash]] and [[hazel]] grow along the edges of the stream.  There is a woodland of [[beech]] and ash at the top of the west slope.  There the scrub includes [[field maple]], hazel and [[Prunus avium|wild cherry]].<ref name=\"GWT nature reserves handbook\"\/>\n\n==Bird life==\n[[Whitethroat]], [[marsh tit]], [[skylark]], [[tree pipit]] and [[grey wagtail]] are some of the birds recorded at the reserve.  The [[great spotted woodpecker]] is also present.<ref name=\"GWT nature reserves handbook\"\/> Over 70 different bird species are recorded for this site.<ref name=\"Snows Farm\"\/>\n\n==Invertebrates==\nThere are good populations recorded of [[small blue]], [[Melanargia galathea|marbled white]] and [[green hairstreak]] butterflies.<ref name=\"GWT nature reserves handbook\"\/> Many moths species are recorded including the [[six-spot burnet]].<ref name=\"Snows Farm\"\/>  Ant-hills from the [[yellow meadow ant]] are present in the pasture.<ref name=\"Snows Farm\"\/> Recorded as plentiful on this site is the [[bloody-nosed beetle]].<ref name=\"GWT nature reserves handbook\"\/> The snail (''[[Helicella itala]]'') is seen, and the rare green spider (''[[Micrommata virescens|Micromatta virescens]]'').<ref name=\"Snows Farm\"\/>\n\n==Reptiles==\n[[Common lizard]] and [[Vipera berus|adder]] may be seen on sunny days.<ref name=\"Snows Farm\"\/>\n\n==Conservation==\nThe traditional management method of sheep grazing is used to control the growth of [[tor-grass]] and [[upright brome]].  This encourages the wild flowers to flourish and to spread. Cattle grazing helps to control scrub, the clearance and control of which is important to maintain the open areas of pasture.<ref name=\"GWT nature reserves handbook\"\/> The correct grazing balance has to be maintained - too much will overgraze the site and too little will allow the vigorous grasses to flourish to the detriment of the flowers.<ref name=\"Snows Farm\"\/>\n\n==Publications==\n{{colbegin}}\n* Kelham, A, Sanderson, J, Doe, J, Edgeley-Smith, M, et al., 1979, 1990, 2002 editions, 'Nature Reserves of the Gloucestershire Trust for Nature Conservation\/Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust'\n* (undated), 'Snow's Farm Reserve Handbook', Gloucestershire Trust for Nature Conservation\n* 'Snows Farm Nature Reserve \u2013 A secret valley paradise for wildlife and people', (undated), Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust\n* \u2018Nature Reserve Guide \u2013 discover the wild Gloucestershire on your doorstep\u2019 - 50th Anniversary, January 2011, Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http:\/\/www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust]\n\n[[Category:Nature reserves in Gloucestershire]]\n[[Category:Cotswolds]]","timestamp":"20160410100017","user-timestamp":"20150410100017"},{"title":"Category talk:Paralympic wheelchair tennis players of Poland","content":"{{WikiProjectBannerShell|1=\n{{WikiProject Biography|sports-priority=NA\n|sports-work-group=yes\n}}\n{{WikiProject Poland}}\n{{WikiProject Industrial design}}\n{{WikiProject Olympics|Paralympics=yes}}\n}}","timestamp":"20160410100018","user-timestamp":"20150410100018"},{"title":"User talk:86.40.50.23","content":"\n== Your submission at [[WP:AFC|Articles for creation]] ==\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #9accf6;background:#f1f9ff;padding:1em;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em;width:20em;color:black;margin-bottom: 1.5em;margin-left: 1.5em;width: 90%;\"> [[File:AFC-Logo_Decline.svg|50px|left]]Thank you for your recent submission to [[WP:AFC|Articles for Creation]].

The breed has a strong neck on an elegant body, a broad, long back, and good hooves, though they are sometimes flat. The mane and tail are very thick. \n\nThe Czech Warmblood is a relatively long-lived, unpretentious and relentless horse. The breed is willing and teachable with a very good temperament. Most are [[black (horse)|black]], [[chestnut (coat)|chestnut]], [[bay (color)|bay]] or dark bay.\n\n==Breed history==\nThe Czech Warmblood was in existence by the time of the [[Austro-Hungarian]] Empire (1876-1918). In the 19th century the breed was influenced by [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Italy|Italian]] horses, and later by breeds such as the Furioso, [[Gidran]], [[Nonius (horse)|Nonius]] and [[Przedswit]] breeds. [[German Warmblood]] horses also played a part. \n\nThe most famous and successful line is the [[Bystr\u00fd]]. The founder was [[Stallion (horse)|Stallion]] 469, foaled in 1919. The line is characterized by a robustness, shorter and a less solid run, steeper and a shorter fetlock. They are mainly [[Bay (horse)|bay]] horses.\n\nThe [[stud farm]] in [[Kladruby nad Labem|Kladruby]] plays a major role in the breeding of the Czech Warmblood. In the pedigree book, many other breeds are mentioned, for example [[Thoroughbred]], [[Selle Francais]], [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] and [[Anglo-Arabian]].\n\n==Uses==\nCzech Warmbloods are suited to all [[Equestrianism|horse sports]]. They are good at [[dressage]] and [[horse racing]] and are also capable of lighter farm and forest work, hunting and jumping.\n\nIn 2013 the population was reported as about 22,000.{{r|dad}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=dad>[http:\/\/dad.fao.org\/cgi-bin\/EfabisWeb.cgi?sid=0b1613ebf16355cf65f6a05b9a65fe25,reportsreport8a_50008183 Breed data sheet: Cesky teplokrevnik\/Czech Republic].

Ten matches were played between 13 January and 14 April.It was contested by [[England national rugby union team|England]], [[France national rugby union team|France]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]].\n\nAs each nation won their two home matches (and therefore lost their two away matches), the championship was shared between all five teams; no further tie-break was applied to separate teams finishing level on match points. This was the only time that the Five Nations championship finished in a five-way tie.\n\nDue to the [[Troubles]] occurring in Ireland, which had resulted in the loss of over 100 British soldiers in 1972 and the potential risks both Scotland and Wales refused to play Ireland in Dublin. Defying expectations to the contrary, England agreed to travel. Despite a poor performance, resulting in an 18-9 loss, England received great credit for their attendance coupled with captain John Pullin's post-match quip \"Well we might not be any good but at least we turned up\".<ref name=EnglishAttendance>{{cite news|

[[User:Nyttend|Nyttend]] ([[User talk:Nyttend|talk]]) 16:51, 14 September 2011 (UTC)\n== Rich Farmbrough violating editing restriction ==\n\n[[User:Rich Farmbrough]] is has an [[Wikipedia:Editing restrictions|editing restriction]] stating \"Regardless of the editing method [...] is indefinitely prohibited from mass creating pages in any namespace, unless prior community approval for the specific mass creation task is documented.\" (for full text, check the linked page). Rich Farmbrough is now mass creating articles imported from Wikisource, from the Dictionary of National Biography. So far, over 100 of those have been created over the last days. These pages are script-generated, with extremely minimal manual work done on them, and are often of very low quality. Problems include \n#The importing of pages that have not even been proofread on Wikisource, leading to incorrect years of birth or death (e.g. [[William Beattie (physician)]] has died on Wikipedia in 1876, but according to the source in 1875; [[George Beattie (poet)]] lived until 1828 here, but until 1823 in the source)\n#Seemingly randomly placed wikilinks, on e.g. John Dunstall, the only \"manual\" edit by Rich Farmbrough[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=John_Dunstall&action=historysubmit&diff=448841521&oldid=448841109] was the addition of wikilinks to either disambiguation pages like [[Charles I]] or [[John Carter]] or to incorrect pages like [[Samuel Clarke]] or [[Custom House]]. The vast majority of links on this page points to an incorrect page. Similarly, [[John Barrow (fl.1756)]] links to the surnames of explorers, with pages like [[wafer]] bluelinked, while e.g. [[Van Noort]] is a redlink that could easily have been turned into [[Olivier van Noort]]. \n#Lack of categories: most pages are only categorized according to the year of birth and dead, not to nationality, profession, or other claim of notability, making them nearly impossible to find through the cat system\n#Blatantly incorrect categories; a number of these pages are categorized not by year of birth and death, but as living people, even though all of these people are very dead; e.g. [[George Steward Beatson]], [[John Bearblock]], [[Richard Butcher (antiquary)]], [[John Dunstall]], [[Gabriel Dugr\u00e8s]], [[William Augustus Barron]], and the fifth-century [[Dubthach Maccu Lugir]]\n*Why he is suggesting to merge an article he just created to a non-existant one is beyond me[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Dubthach_Maccu_Lugir&action=historysubmit&diff=447416794&oldid=447414717]\n\nPerfection is not required, but blindly copying pages from Wikisource that have not even been proofread, inserting useless wikilinks, and listing a significant number of pages as cat:living people for long-death people (from a source that doesn't list a single living person anymore...) is poor form, and coming from a person who already has an editing restriction against the mass creation of pages (beacuse of problems with the poor quality of them), this is a lot worse. The pages are listed as [[:Category:DNB drafts]], but, well, drafts shouldn't be placed in the mainspace but in userspace.

Previous discussions with Rich Farmbrough for other violations of his editing restrictions didn't lead to anything productive, e.g. the discussion [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARich_Farmbrough&action=historysubmit&diff=439241153&oldid=439240521 ended here] about the violations made by his alternate account [[User:Megaphone Duck]], or these ones [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARich_Farmbrough&action=historysubmit&diff=439231078&oldid=439228866#Apparent_violation_of_restrictions.2C_and_a_number_of_errors_in_AWB_edits here],[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARich_Farmbrough&action=historysubmit&diff=423497087&oldid=423496809], and others. I don't have the feeling that he takes into account anything said be me, so if someone else wants to discuss this with him first, they are free to do so. But it is far from the first time that he has violated these restrictions (see also his block log), although the violations are less common than they used to be last year. But also note e.g. his series of AWB edits from late August[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Azizul_Huque&diff=prev&oldid=447319870][http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Neil_Grove&diff=prev&oldid=447319736][http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Salvacion_Z._Perez&diff=prev&oldid=447319624][http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=P._Vijay&diff=prev&oldid=447319587][http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Ron_Holmes&diff=prev&oldid=447319535]... which are a violation of his ''other'' editing restriction, and go directly against a request made by me (and others like Magioladitis) to leave the capitalization of parameters in Persondata alone (see e.g. [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Rich_Farmbrough&oldid=417166960#Controversial_and.2For_incorrect_AWB_edits] for an older discussion of this).

Rich Farmbrough has replied as well. His reply doesn't address the basic question of the editing restrictions at all, and gives unsatisfactory answers otherwise:\n*1: \"it is only when the DNB process fails that an unproofread page will be used.\" So when Rich Farmbrough uses a page from Wikisource that isn't proofread already, and imports it without checking it, it is the fault of Wikisource? \n*2: \"there is nothing wrong with dab links, a separate process cleans them up.\" That process exists of ''editors'', no automatic cleanup of dablinks exists. He is deliberately creating extra work for other editors because he doesn't want to spend the necessary time to get his links right. Furthermore, not all incorrect links he introduced were dab links, many just pointed to the incorrect page (I gave e.g. the \"wafer\" and \"Custom House\" example above, there are plenty others to be found as well).\n*3: \"the professional categorisers do a far better job far faster than I could.\" Really? The \"additional categories\" backlink goes back to April, and e.g. the article [[Peter Elmsley (bookseller)]], which he created in May, still needs further categorisation. I don't believe that he couldn't have done that job faster than that.\n*4: Haha, but seriously: \"easily fixed. (Now fixed.)\" Really? I listed above [[William Augustus Barron]], which has now been categorised among the living people for 2 months, and wasn't fixed. If he hasn't even fixed one I so conveniently mentioned above as having that problem, I doubt that he has fixed them all, and control indicates that he has indeed still 5 articles among his DNB drafts which are listed as \"living people\"... \n*5: Looking at his other \"corrections\" after this thread started, there is [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Duff_%28d.967%29&diff=prev&oldid=449243051]: incorrect edit summary, and the article now has both the cat \"year of death missing\" and \"967 deaths\"; the one before that [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Dubthach_Maccu_Lugir&diff=prev&oldid=449242965] has the same incorrect edit summary, and still has that nonsense merge tag he put on it; and the one before that [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=William_Beattie_%28physician%29&diff=prev&oldid=449242220] also has the incorrect edit summary, an incorrect year \"11793\" in the persondata, and no correction of the inconsistent dates which I indicated above. Need I go on? \n\nAll this indicates to me that Rich Farmbrough is not acknowledging that this was a violation of his editing restrictions (which everyone seems to agree on), that he doesn't see a problem in introducing unchecked and incorrectly transcribed material, and that he feels it is normal to deliberately include incorrect info (links) or to deliberately leave out user-friendly things (cats), because eventually, perhaps, someone else will cleanup after him. And finally, that when he does correct errors that have been pointed out to him, he does so in a very sloppy manner, introducing new errors and carelessly believing that something is \"fixed\" when it isn't. \n\nDoes anyone has any suggestion as to how this can be remedied?

I agree that he does some dubious edits (if nothing else just by sheer volume alone hes going to have some) but I think a lot of the huff has been blown out of proportion. I think in general he does more good than harm which is also evident in the fact he is allowed to keep editing.\n:'''To Xeno''' - First let me clarify that aside from Rich's edits I personally think that the limitation set forth (mostly imposed by you) that making cosmetic changes to wikicode that have no effect on the rendered page is a bad thing. There are plenty of things out there that don't change the rendering of the page that don't need to be in the article such as Innapproraite comments, dead parameters in templates, empty parameters in templates taking up space and making the page harder and more confusing to edit, etc. This leaves us with piles and piles of garbage in the articles in talk pages we can't get rid of without inventing another edit of some kind that changes the rendering of the page like adding a category, portal, tweaking some grammer by adding a comma, etc. Second, For your info that edit you bring up '''does''' make a visible change to the page because it adds the date. Look closer at the comment box and you'll see it. :-) Also, For years adding the date to a maintenance tag was a reguler edit by the bot and it was a highly desired edit. Now all of a sudden because of a shortsighted rule we \"can't date maintenance tags\" or is it more because of who is doing it...Im not quite clear on that one.\n:I'm not going to continue to beat a dead horse but I wanted to voice my opinion that, regardless of the edits made, some editors are going to persist in following Rich around until one of his edits does something they don't like and well be right back here. We all do edits that irritate others, delete images, remove garbage from articles, edit too fast, etc. We don't need to block someone every time they do an edit. --[[User:Kumioko|Kumioko]] ([[User talk:Kumioko|talk]]) 14:30, 9 September 2011 (UTC)\n::It's not the dating of the maintenance tag that is the issue, its the spacing he changed down by the logo parameter I believe.

Regardless of wether I agree with the block and eventhough the bot may be working but if the bot owner is blocked its innappropriate IMO for the bot to be running unless there is another operator that can and is willing to fix anything that doesn't work right. Unfortunately this also stops all the good edits these bots do like bulding the watchlists for the WikiProjects and all the edits that the bot formerly known as Smackbot (Helpful Pixie bot) does. --[[User:Kumioko|Kumioko]] ([[User talk:Kumioko|talk]]) 14:39, 9 September 2011 (UTC)\n::::'''To Djsasso''' - I disagree with that assessment. I agree that the bot '''should not''' be removing spaces like that or other truly minor edits alone but if the bot is already there doing another edit that is significant (renders a change to the page or whatever) then it '''should''' do that while its there. Otherwise these minor little things would stay there forever. --[[User:Kumioko|Kumioko]] ([[User talk:Kumioko|talk]]) 14:42, 9 September 2011 (UTC)\n:::::For other bot runners and editors yes.

But...This is goign to continue until Rich is permanantly blocked IMO so you may as well get it over with and move on.

Just a few minutes ago you said it was cause it didn't make a change to the rendering of the page and now its cause it changed the capitalization to '''match''' what the template looks like when you go [[Template:Unreferenced]]? I think you are just trying to justify it. I still think that someone needs to stop the bots also. If the owner is blocked the bots shouldn't be running. Even if there are a whole ton of good things that those bots are doing. I also don't think we should choose when to enforce the rules. If we are going to enforce them on one bot then we should do it to the others as well. Like the one that adds the interlanguage links that don't change the rendering of the page, or the one that removes the commented out deleted images from articles. We should stop these 2 as well since they are violating the rules. --[[User:Kumioko|Kumioko]] ([[User talk:Kumioko|talk]]) 15:03, 9 September 2011 (UTC)\n:::::::::Kumioko, your contributions to these threads concerning inappropriate tool-assisted editing frequently include irrelevant tangents such as this. Are those processes approved by the Bot Approvals Group? Are the operators of those processes under editing restrictions? If the answers are \"Yes\" and \"No\", then I don't see how your suggestion is at all relevant. There is no consensus that templates must have first-letter capitalization and they function fine either way. Rich has been formally restricted from changing the capitalization of templates, yet he continues to do so. That is what is relevant here. \u2013[[user:xeno|<font face=\"verdana\" color=\"black\">'''xeno'''<\/font>]][[user talk:xeno|<font color=\"black\"><sup>talk<\/sup><\/font>]] 15:15, 9 September 2011 (UTC)\n::::::::::Just because you don't like my arguments or someone questioning your judgement doesn't make them irrelevent. But that was a nice try and deflecting the problem back at me. But my point above was that you didn't even know in the beginning why it was a problem until you came back later with the first letter case change argument. Additionally, if the rule is that we cannot make changes that don't render changes to the page, and that is a rule, then who is the Bot approval group to overrule it? Do they have the right to overrule concensus on any rule? I think not. They choose to follow the rule when it suits them best, or to enforce it the same way. If we are going to make a rule then we ALL need to follow it. I have told you repeatedly I think its a stupid rule but consensus created it and I can live with that. But what I find irritating is when a small handful of editors seems to have the power or the administrative capabilites to ignore it whenever they want, or when it affects them.

If one editor is doing something to the extreme and causing a lot of mistakes and trouble and the community (on this page or ANI) comes to a consensus that what they are doing is wrong and they place restrictions on the user of course we are doing it to one user and not another. Its no different from blocking an editor. In this particular case these restrictions were put on him so that he wouldn't have to be blocked and so that he could still be productive on the wiki.

The practice of dating the maintenance tags has been going for several years and I believe he did that when Xeno forced AWB to add a bullet that stopped allowing what he perceives as pointless edits because they don't render anything to the page. Aside from that dating the template is a good thing even if it doesn't change the look. It lets us know how long the artile has been tagged. It also adds it to the appropriate category. So there is really no valid argument against dating maintenance tags unless the goal is just to get Rich blocked.

He is aware there is a set consequence for breaching them. And frankly, as a community, Wikipedia ''needs'' to see those consequences kick in, otherwise other editors can rightly bitch that some editors are more equal than others.<br>And getting back to \"good faith\"... There are really two aspects at play here. One is editing in good faith to improve article content. For the most part it does not look like Rich is editing in conflict with this. The other is editing in good faith with the community. And this is where we have the problem (and FWIW not only with this specific case of a restricted editor but with a few others as well).

Sure, we ban editors which are a mass negative, we ban editors who massively break things here on Wikipedia, but editors who do a lot of good here but where the community thinks that parts of their work should be done with more care, no.  And I am also against that even after we have been to the dramaboards with such editors for a gazillion times.  I am sorry, the tours to the dramaboards cause more disruption than the actual disruption that is caused by the breaking of the editing restrictions.  I know why the editing restrictions are there, I know that they were violated - use blocks of increasing length to stop the disruption (although that also stops the good work for some time, and it almost sounds punishing), but banning should not be used for such things.  And this is not the first time that we here try to ban such editors, and as I already expected earlier, this remedy is giving the wrong signal to the community (I am already afraid that this will be taken over by ArbCom in a couple of days when this proposal does not get to a proper consensus).  --[[User:Beetstra|Dirk Beetstra]] <sup>[[User_Talk:Beetstra|<span style=\"color:#0000FF;\">T<\/span>]] [[Special:Contributions\/Beetstra|<span style=\"color:#0000FF;\">C<\/span>]]<\/sup> 08:45, 13 September 2011 (UTC)\n*'''Strong oppose''' Overall, Rich is a net asset to the project; banning is only for people who are hurting the encyclopedia.

Some people might see doing this now as POINTy.  The use of Kinky , especially, would seem at attempt to use a totally unspecifiable and personal label.  The use of  anatomical -- how would anyone be able to say which of our images of anatomy might disturb somebody--or is the intention to cover all images of body parts, such as hands? The bad image list has one legitimate purpose only, which is not to avoid disturbing people, but to limit the misuse of a variety of images known to have been commonly used for vandalism.  Either something is used that way, or it isn't. Labeling is supposed to have an actual purpose.  Tfd would appear the way to go on these, unless their creator wants to make that unnecessary by withdrawing them.

It discourages people from using the material, it insults the people who think they do not need such warnings, it encourages blatant outside censorship by giving them a handle (and you've said as much: you wish them to be available for use in image filters), and it is the first step towards actual prohibition,   I think your discussion of additional such tagging as showing your desire to extend this.

What matters is not what ''can'' count as a revert, but what ''does'' count as a revert. The policy language makes it clear what ''does'' count as a revert, and that part of the policy language has been quoted to Sillystuff more than once. I might add that in the policy, the key language is bolded and in a colored circle. To elaborate, if Sillystuff in his first edit had ''added'' material to the page, it would not have counted as a revert because it did not \"undo[] another editor's work\", whereas an edit that undoes can be the beginning of an editor's undoing (sorry, couldn't resist). After that first revert, of course, the next three reverts have to take place in a 24-hour period to violate the rule, although as others have rightly pointed out and as the 3RR policy states, one can be blocked for warring, even if one does not violate the \"bright-line\" aspect of 3RR.--[[User:Bbb23|Bbb23]] ([[User talk:Bbb23|talk]]) 16:36, 19 September 2011 (UTC)\n*Note, [[User:Sillystuff84|Sillystuff84]] is now canvasing the edit warring discussion.

I attempted to guess what the \"pre-dispute\" version was, and reverted to that.  I have never edited that article or its talk page.  However, I am quite involved with all of the regular editors (in fact, some people think I'm part of an unholy, power-tripping triumvirate with two of them), so some might argue that my protection violates [[WP:INVOLVED]].  My feeling is that the action is acceptable, since full protection is actually for the ''benefit'' of all of the editors (and, of course, Wikipedia).  If anyone thinks I've done wrong, please slap me, feel free to undo the protection, and\/or change the version that's protected.

Presently, you have even changed the article content and protected it despite being heavily involved(in the caste article area and the eds involved there). You have even issued an oblique threat of block to me on the [[talk:Lodhi]] page. You are also involved with me on a number of caste articles. You are a '''blot''' on the name of admins.

In fact, if I had to make the call myself, it would be MV who is closest to editor warring, and Fowler&Fowler who needs a stern warning for incivility in edit summaries. Furthermore, I protected the article the way it stood before edit-warring--in fact, I actually chose that version because a cursory glance made me think it was closer to the version ''you'' liked than the one MV liked, to further show that I was acting neutrally.  Apologies if I chose the wrong version, although, by definition, every version is the wrong version for someone.  But if you feel there was a more proper version of the article that goes back farther, then please indicate which diff and I another admin can change the protected version (note that no admin should arbitrarily choose one version in the ''middle'' of the edit war).  Please note that I literally haven't even read the article yet, nor any of the sources, and have made absolutely no effort to determine which of you, if any, is \"right\"--all I did was look for the last semi-stable version (i.e., before MatthewVanitas added a bunch of new text that you and Fowler&Fowler seemed to be objecting to), and chose that as the version to protect. Finally, every single person I've sought to have blocked was, in the end, an editor engaged in sockpuppetry or gross personal attacks--and no amount of systemic bias justifies sockpuppetry, editing through a block or ban, or gross incivility.  One report Sitush made turned out to be false, and he apologized for that. It's not our fault that some editors feel so strongly that they have to promote their own caste and bring down others that they are willing to break Wikipedia's policies to do so.  [[User:Qwyrxian|Qwyrxian]] ([[User talk:Qwyrxian|talk]]) 03:44, 19 September 2011 (UTC)\n::::The one report that turned out to be false was against me and it was a pretty random sockpuppetry allegation.

As far as Qwyrxian is concerned, I've seen patronizing advise directed at Indian editors at [[talk:Jan Lokpal Bill]], on another admin's user page and an implication that Indian editors are somehow incapable of following policies. All of this, IMO, is a manifestation of the generalizations and the assumptions being made about Indian editors. While there may be many such editors, we do not make such broad-ranging generalizations in real life and neither should we make them here.

I honestly thought I was protecting the version ''you'' preferred, not MV\/Sitush.  The only point behind the protection is to make the edit warring stop and have everyone discuss the issue on the article's talk page.  I seriously don't care which version you end up with, nor do I plan on even helping you decide, because I have plenty of articles to already deal with and I don't need another dispute.  Would you have preferred that I protected the version of the article just before I set up the protection?  Those are really the only two options available to a protecting admin--the pre-dispute, or the current version (unless there's BLP\/copy-vio problems, which did not seem to be the case here).  [[User:Qwyrxian|Qwyrxian]] ([[User talk:Qwyrxian|talk]]) 04:57, 19 September 2011 (UTC)\n:::::::::Funny that someone can express narrow minded and prejudiced views at a page without editing at all!  Claims that editors' beliefs make them ineligible for adminship are attempts at censorship; see [[WP:CENSOR|this relevant page]].  [[User:Nyttend|Nyttend]] ([[User talk:Nyttend|talk]]) 05:02, 19 September 2011 (UTC)\n:::::::::Looking at the diffs from Zuggernaut, in the first one, it looks like I'm criticizing both Fowler&Fowler and Sitush. The only generalization I make is about articles, not people; that generalization was based on past experience, but I am actually beginning to think that generalization is wrong--almost all of the caste articles are battlegrounds with lots of bad faith editing.  The edit on Jan Lokpal is a standard declaration of [[WP:NOTFORUM]], and I was actually a bit bothered that you removed it.  Because that subject was so prevalent in the Indian news, both the article and the article's talk page were getting tons of edits either in support or opposition to the Bill, not about improving the article in a neutral way. I was letting editors know that we don't tolerate that type of discussion, and that such posts can and would be removed.  The one on Dougweller's is actually one that I was thinking you'd raise, and is something I stand by.  Non-western countries have different opinions about what is a reliable source for truth, about what is legitimate copying and what is not, and about what it means to be \"neutral\".  This is well-verified by quite a bit of research.  This does not make one system better than another, but it does make them different.  Wikipedia's \"culture\" is, by and large, based on Western (and especially, US \"academic\") culture, particular with regards to intellectual property and reliable sources.  For example, we don't consider information written in ancient religious documents (from any faith) to be \"reliable\" in the sense of them providing facts about the world.  Not all of our editors agree--some Indian editors, for instance, consider their interpretations of the Puranas to be sufficiently reliable to be all the sourcing we ever need; similarly, some Evangelical Christians have at times tried to argue that the Bible is a sufficient source of evidence for other information; similarly, every day we get Muslim editors who try to tell us that our articles must be changed to conform with Islamic rules.  Wikipedia rejects these views. I am concerned that Wikipedia is doing a good job of inviting previously un-included people to the site, but isn't doing a good job of explaining our culture.  Many Indian (etc.) editor are more than capable of learning Wikipedia's culture; many of them may already have it, depending on exactly what way they've been educated.  Some of them, sadly, are not (and this is true across cultures). The problem is that Wikipedia is inviting all of these new people, but is acting like it's ''their'' fault if they don't understand, right away, how our culture works. This is the standard colonial\/oppressive mentality--that our way is obviously \"right\" and \"superior\", and that everyone of course knows this.  Thus, if we're not careful, our outreach programs actually ''reinforce'' systemic bias, rather than right it, because we failed to provide a proper introduction to how we work.  Finally, I'd like to direct your attention to [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Gyanvigyan1&diff=450282229&oldid=450277216] and [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Gyanvigyan1&diff=450296750&oldid=450292343], from a conversation I had with MangoWong on another user's talk page, that may give you a little more insight into my thoughts in this matter.

It was apparent on looking at the article history that the reporting editor was trying to add contentious information about a [[WP:FRINGE]] theory, based on a YouTube video.  Not surprisingly, three established editors were reverting him on fairly sound policy grounds, and he was up to six reverts by this point. He had also reported one of those reverting him to [[WP:AIV]] (report declined by the reviewing admin there).  I blocked him for 72 hours, and started a discussion on his talk page about what the problem was.  [[User:Blanchardb]] and [[User:Slrubenstein]] have also contributed.

Alternately, is there someone out there who might have better success getting through to him.

Good block, good indef block. Anyone who wants to spend their time explaining it over and over through talk: is welcome to, in that worthy but probably futile endeavour, but anything outside that one user talk: page is likely to be an imposed time-sink for editors who do have more useful things to be doing. \n:: On another aspect, I'd like to see an article on [[Jesus in Katmandu]], along with [[Joseph of Arimathea in Glastonbury]] etc. Fringe theories and myths, even when demonstrably wrong, have their place in an encyclopedia too, when appropriately sourced and neutrally written (Achieving that neutrality, mind you...).

You appear to have zero desire to read nor understand the [[WP:5P|basic principles of Wikipedia]], and your unblock request shows this clearly''. FPAS beat me to it.

Given that it is apparent that a 72-hour block has achieved none of this, and given that the editor has shown intent to continue disrupting Wikipedia to make sure his views are permanently inserted in the article, I think forcing him to review his behavior ''before'' he's allowed to edit again, regardless of how long that takes, is perfectly in line with our blocking policy. --<span style=\"background:#CC1010;color:#FFA0A0\">'''&nbsp;Blanchardb'''&nbsp;<\/span>-<sup><span style=\"color:#A62428\">[[User:Blanchardb|Me]]\u2022[[User Talk:Blanchardb|MyEars]]\u2022[[Special:Contributions\/Blanchardb|MyMouth]]<\/span><\/sup>- timed 13:56, 19 September 2011 (UTC)\n:Let the current block ride out and expire.

That one seems OK, even if maybe slightly harsh, as Wikiglobaleditor was disruptive. Turning into indef simply because during the first few hours Wikiglobaleditor and others kept a futile and harsh argument makes little sense. If the point was to give 72h to cool down, then let that period run and then see if it cooled down or not. If you keep fuelling the discussion most naturally it carries on. Down-talking the user's sources because [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Wikiglobaleditor&diff=next&oldid=451020348 \"our primary focus is the mainstream view of the English speaking world\"](?!) does not help (note: I am Portuguese); calling him a [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Jesus&diff=450974787&oldid=450961032 \"couch-potato\"] does not help; [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Wikiglobaleditor&diff=451299297&oldid=451282639 '''<u>SHOUTING<\/u>'''] at him does not help. So, lets help him to help himself by giving him a real chance of becoming a useful editor, by restoring the 72h block? - [[User:Nabla|Nabla]] ([[User talk:Nabla|talk]]) 17:50, 19 September 2011 (UTC)\n::Point of order - I appreciate your input, but the block wasn't \"72h to cool down\", it was because he was persisting in reverting three other editors, to the extent that he had reached 6RR. I don't do cooldown blocks. The conversation on his talkpage was not \"a futile and harsh argument\", it was an attempt by several editors to get him to understand policy, and avoid him running straight back to the article - particularly necessary after he appealed the initial block on the grounds that he was not the one edit warring.  While I agree that the phrase about the mainstream view of the English speaking world was clumsy and did not convey what I meant, (a) it remains true that Wikipedia regards the theory that Jesus escaped to Kashmir as a fringe theory and (b) a pirate youtube copy of a popular tv show does not a reliable source make in this highly contentious area. If you think there is a better way that could have been explained to him, I am open to suggestions, as it clearly didn't go too well when I tried.  [[User:Elen of the Roads|Elen of the Roads]] ([[User talk:Elen of the Roads|talk]]) 18:35, 19 September 2011 (UTC)\n:::Two points taken! First, your block did not explicit mention any cool down. Still, what was the intention? In the short term, to avoid further reverts, as you say, in the 72h the intention was?... I presume you hoped that after 72h the situation could normalise (and that is what *I* called cool down); Second, the argument was not futile, my bad expression, it was fruitless. But I stick to harsh with all those bolds, underlines and caps going on (not by you, I note). As to a better way of handling I already said it above, but I'll underline and expand a bit: in generally policy (sources, etc) and alternatives (write another article, ...) was well explained to the user, but it was counter-productive to have a few harsh remarks as I have pointed above, that is one thing that could have been different, but well, no big deal and we all do it once in a while. Most of all you could have kept you word (and still can): you have blocked for 72h (fine), you stated that you'd block longer if he engaged in edit warring (quite fine), the user said he would only edit the talk page. Good! Looks like you got yourself a deal! Then another user (Slrubenstein) comes in. He previous called Wikiglobaleditor a \"couch-potato\", now he makes long lecture, downtalks and shouts at Wikiglobaleditor's reply. Wikiglobaleditor shouts *back* at him and so you extend the block? Not the best option it seems. You talked him out to a deal, and it was a good deal; he gets to have his say on the talk page, eventually we may get ourselves a new stub about it, and if the user failed to do so... you would block. Considering the extenuating circumstances, that the user was poked, and as a sign of good faith I ask you to get the block back to the initial deadline. Or allow me to do so - [[User:Nabla|Nabla]] ([[User talk:Nabla|talk]]) 19:43, 19 September 2011 (UTC)\n::::See [[WP:CDB]]. The term \"cool down block\" carries negative connotations and is against the blocking policy, which is probably why Elen was keen to clarify that she did not block Wikiglobaleditor to make him cool down. [[User:Jenks24|Jenks24]] ([[User talk:Jenks24|talk]]) 20:59, 19 September 2011 (UTC)\n:::::Right, I did not recalled the WP slang when I wrote that.

Thanks - [[User:Nabla|Nabla]] ([[User talk:Nabla|talk]]) 01:56, 20 September 2011 (UTC)\n:::(ec)Nabla, if you want to fault me for overzealous comments that you may feel are unconstructive or inappropriate, fair enough.  I must ad that in what you call my long \"lecture\" I was actually trying to explain that Ellen's words about English-speaking were wrong and that we welcome editors who read and write other languages and scholarly sources in other languages, surely this was a good thing to do.  I did not quite call him a couch-potato; I did say that one cannot be an encyclopedia researcher by being a couch potato and I stand by this, although you have a right to disagree.\n\n:::Be that as it may most of what you see as problematic has to do with me, not with Ellen of the Roads, and I would hate for you or anyone else to evaluate her block based on my own expressed views (and how I express them). My understanding is that Ellen made the block indefinite because Wikiglobaleditor stated explicitly that when the block expired he will return to using talk pages as \"soap-boxes\" for arguing his own POV. I do not think the issue is simply cooling down because he is not being blocked for misrepresenting me or insulting me or arguing against me - the problem is not his ''hot-headedness'' and I have to emphasize that I was never involved in an edit-conflict or edit-war with this editor, so whatever heat is between us is I think secondary to the main issue. Ellen's block was not - or not primarily, as I interpret it - to give this editor time to \"cool down;\" it is at least as much to give the editor time to familiarize himself with the many policies and guidelines he had been violating. And his most recent talk on his user-page not only gives no evidence that he has yet taken any time to look at our policies (and I added a wikiwelcome with links to make it easier for him). I think this is another reason to consider extending the block. Personally, as soon as Wikiglobaleditor shows that he has read the policies to which several other editors have referred him, and shows and inclination to take them into account in his editing, I would favor lifting the block. In any event, these are in my view the key issues, not hot-tempers, and I think Ellen has tried her best to explain it to him, and several other editors have added their own views, clarifying where necessary comments made by Ellen. [[User:Slrubenstein|Slrubenstein]]   |  [[User talk:Slrubenstein|Talk]] 19:51, 19 September 2011 (UTC)\n::::Though I don't like the expression, I agree that \"one cannot be an encyclopedia researcher by being a couch potato\", but your words were not generic as used here (''one can not be...'') but directed at him (''you can not be''): \u00abI am afraid, Wikiglobaleditor, that you have to be more than a couch-potato to research an encyclopedia article\u00bb. Again, no big deal, it happens, but you were, let's say, unpolite enough so that the other party may rightfully feel insulted, even if you did not meant it.

Given the chap's last but one edit [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Wikiglobaleditor&diff=451368561&oldid=451317823] aimed at Slrubenstein I am extremely disinclined to unblock. The personal attacks \"lying after lying\" The claim to being a long term editor when the account was registered on 8 July 2011 \"You don't have any idea who I am... I associated in the wiki-projects and Jimmy Wales since 2004...my contribution as a Editor - just go through them\".  The threats \"now I have to report my findings on wiki editorial environment to somewhere else, and that is more important.\" all give me serious cause for concern.  And his response to Maunus [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Wikiglobaleditor&diff=451381300&oldid=451378696] doesn't inspire confidence either. [[User:Elen of the Roads|Elen of the Roads]] ([[User talk:Elen of the Roads|talk]]) 20:31, 19 September 2011 (UTC)\n:Right, that one reply to Slrubenstein is not good, I haven't really noticed it yet. Wikiglobaleditor does have some 100 decent previous edits with no problem (checked a few at random) over 2 months. It was positive contribuition, and seems it was completely ignored, bot not much, obviously not a long term editor. And the rest well... I hope Jimmy Wales has few such friends... If any. The second reply, I see no problem, after having multiple editors saying him more or less the same thing again and again he wishes to stpo the argument. Sounds reasonable. Bottom line: Quite likely he is simply in a trolling rampage, and most likely he would get the indef block anyway after the 72h block, but we could no know that for sure. You condemned him because he might be disruptive (and he might express a minority opinion on talk pages, maybe?). I've seem [[Minority Report (film)]] a few years ago, good movie. Have you? They had ''precogs'' and even so they could guess future crimes wrong. I will not insist you lift the block, looks like I'm alone on thinking there would be less harm done lifting the block, than there is in keeping it. - [[User:Nabla|Nabla]] ([[User talk:Nabla|talk]]) 01:56, 20 September 2011 (UTC)\n::On the basis of the very serious edit warring which led to the block and the editor's subsequent posts on their talk page, it seems to be a certainty that they'll behave unacceptably if unblocked. I don't think that it's a good idea to unblock someone as an experiment to see if they'll continue to behave disruptively. If Wikiglobaleditor calms down and makes commitments to edit in a collaborative fashion things would be very different.

He joined at the start of July, and has been making useful gnome-type edits, mostly tagging, some Afds that were unproblematic.  The edit that caused all the trouble was his first attempt to add \"serious level\" content to the encyclopaedia.  I think what happened surprised him, because he thought the rules worked completely differently to the way that they do.  But if someone edit wars, and continues to insist that they weren't edit warring, it is hard to justify unblocking.  If he would accept someone talking to him about what went wrong, I would have thought an unblock would be possible, but he's just deleted BWilkins attempt [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Wikiglobaleditor&curid=32355488&diff=451508121&oldid=451498885] without comment.

I think no matter what we do or don't do, maintaining open access is critical. At a university, unlike a high school with a limited number of computers and access points, it is not necessarily practical to identify particular users, which is basically a good thing, because users at a university need & deserve some degree of anonymity from their administration. (And the administration needs to be able to truthfully respond, just as we need to respond, that they cannot necessarily identify individuals.)  And, as a practical matter, there's no particular reason he should limit himself to GU; so it won't even help if they throw him out; it may just make him even harder to detect.  I'm told above  that the speculations of some Wikipedians that it only affects a small part of the university were not correct. We need to protect our contents, certainly, but the balance here is wrong. If I were one of the Ambassadors there, I am not sure I would be willing to continue under such difficulties.   I remember for one class in NYC I ended up having to substitute a different lesson at the last minute because there wasn't time for me to figure out account creation. Of course I could if it were to be needed again. But  we have an obligation to potential users who are not taking classes also.  The entire point of Wikipedia is openness.

Yes, the whole PRC\/ROC thing complicates things, but it's also a distraction from what the current everyday use of the word \"China\" (when referring to geography) is in the English language. English changes over time, and it has changed so that currently \"China\" = PRC much as gay now means homosexual and (going for an much older shift) meat came to refer to the \"flesh of land-dwelling animals\" as opposed to the older definition of simply \"food\". We can address the PRC\/ROC either via a \"see also\" at the top of the article and\/or a clarification in the text of the article body.

The reasoning is straightforward. The main argument against moving is that, by choosing to point to PRC, we will end up being non-neutral. However, the essence of neutrality on wikipedia is that rather than being conscious neutral by giving equal weight to all viewpoints in deciding on a title, we leave the decision to usage (''If a name is widely used in reliable sources (particularly those written in English), and is therefore likely to be well recognized by readers, it may be used even though some may regard it as biased'' (from [[Wikipedia:NPOV#Naming]]). It is clear that, in current usage, PRC is the primary topic for China and China is the common name for the entity known as PRC, and reliable sources overwhelmingly confirm this. Therefore neutrality requires that we move PRC to China. At best, the China article should contain a reference to the fact that the ROC also claims to be the legitimate China (assuming that they do that). --[[User:RegentsPark|rgpk]] <small>([[User talk:RegentsPark|comment]])<\/small> 16:17, 19 September 2011 (UTC)\n::::It looks like we're all on the same page.

I would support an expandable hatnote in which we make it clear to readers that there are two countries whose legal names include the word \"China\", and that they both have claims of sovereignty over the same territory. However, one of those countries is commonly called \"China\", and the other is commonly called \"Taiwan\", or \"ROC\". The unadorned word \"China\" refers overwhelmingly to the country currently administered as the PRC. <p> I'll be more than happy to help fix links after the moves; they are numerous. -[[User:GTBacchus|GTBacchus]]<sup>([[User talk:GTBacchus|talk]])<\/sup> 22:59, 19 September 2011 (UTC)\n\nThank you, Tabercil, RegentsPark, and GTBacchus, for reading through the lengthy, contentious move discussion and providing rationales for the decision you three made.

First of all, I was not on this committee by \"convenience\" as one of \"the first three to come\". I don't pay much attention to this page, and never would have seen this in passing. Rather, I was approached and asked to be a member, specifically because I have a long history of closing literally thousands of move requests, and I've got a lot of experience with particularly contentious ones. Did you know that? Do you consider that a form of \"convenience polling\"? <p> Secondly, you assert that it's \"clear\" that we \"missed the strongest opposing point\", namely, whether or not Taiwan is part of China. That's actually the only point on which I had to carefully deliberate. Everything else was clear as day, so the point you say it's \"clear\" I missed is actually the one I thought very carefully about for more than 24 hours - actually for more than 24 days, because I've been aware of this move request and the related RfC for a long time. This move request has been on my mind for weeks. <p> These moves do '''not''' imply that Taiwan is not a part of China. They imply that the common name for the PRC is \"China\", and that the overwhelming use of the word \"China\" is to refer to the PRC. It is '''abundantly''' clear that the issue of whether Taiwan is a part of China is the '''only reason''' that this move was contentious. That's the only thing that actually required deliberation. Without that consideration, this all would have been trivial and obvious. <p> I, for one, will be following up on this move, and intend to be active in post-move edits, ensuring that the ROC\/PRC issue is adequately addressed, very first thing in the China article, before the lede section. I think the idea of a custom-made, expandable hatnote is a good one, and I hope I have a chance to help implement it. The situation with PRC and ROC - the issue of cross-strait relations - is extremely important, and must be addressed in our China article at the top of the page. The history of this move proposal makes that abundantly clear. <p> Now Tartanator, have I addressed your concerns, or would you like to hear more details about my thoughts on whether these moves imply that Taiwan is or is not part of China? I will be happy to go into more details, if you like, because it is literally '''all''' I thought about in considering this move request. -[[User:GTBacchus|GTBacchus]]<sup>([[User talk:GTBacchus|talk]])<\/sup> 05:50, 20 September 2011 (UTC)\n::::All of that said...

The point of contention, is, of course, a point of contention, and is thus a matter of interpretation. To me, titles also affect content, and in the interest of building an encyclopaedia that '''represents reality''', we would have to state that Taiwan is definitely not part of (i.e. controlled by) China because we are making China and PRC interchangeable terms. Also, exactly the same arguments were made in the last pushes to move PRC to \"China\", so it is difficult to believe that ''three'' administrators can have mirrored viewpoints.\n:Tabercil, there is nothing implicitly wrong if anyone who opposes the move request does what I have done: to consider an appeal. And I expected a \"no consensus\" close yet again, not \"not moved\".\n:RegentsPark, the solipsism argument is a non-argument. Nothing political is permanent. We are describing current boundaries, and so the boundaries of most nations, especially those without territories, is definite.

We have articles called [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Seven deadly sins]], [[No Child Left Behind Act]] and [[War on Terror]]. Those titles do not mean that we're asserting that one can wage a \"war\" on \"terror\", that no children were left behind by Mr. Bush's policy, that sloth really is a \"sin\" (much less a \"deadly\" one), or that the Holy Roman Empire was \"holy\", \"Roman\", or an \"empire\". <p> Titles are ''labels'', not ''content''. Assertions about reality occur in the article content, after the title, and they often show the problems with any apparent implications of the title. The article content of our [[China]] article will make cross-strait issues very clear, from the very start; I'll personally be there to ensure that happens.

I recommend trialing the triumvirate approach with several contentious XfDs before deciding whether it is a positive.

I'm very pleased with the way triumvirate closures seem to be helpful in shutting down controversy.  I do suggest that triumvirate closures should be reserved for exceptional cases: highly contentious DRVs or RFCs where there is genuinely no consensus across the wider community, but which seem to call for a decision rather than a compromise.  I don't agree with the suggestion of five randomly-selected admins--I think that the only situations in which a triumvirate would be inadequate are matters for arbcom.\u2014[[User:S Marshall|<font face=\"Verdana\" color=\"Maroon\">'''S Marshall'''<\/font>]] <small>[[User talk:S Marshall|T]]\/[[Special:Contributions\/S Marshall|C]]<\/small> 22:44, 21 September 2011 (UTC)\n**Interesting, thanks.  Perhaps one way of circumventing the 2\u20131 problem identified by Cunard would be solidarity: only the three admins would know whether it was unanimous or 2\u20131.  Of course, the drawback is that is is less transparent, and would require off-wiki communication.  On S Marshall's point, I fully agree that this should be reserved for exceptional cases, like the China naming controversy.--[[User:Mkativerata|Mkativerata]] ([[User talk:Mkativerata|talk]]) 07:29, 22 September 2011 (UTC)\n***A proposal that included off-wiki discussion among the admins likely would not pass. I think there would be accusations of back-channel dealing were admins to deliberate in private. Second, an admin who didn't support the majority opinion would be forced either to disclose their stance or defend a close they didn't support. It's better and much simpler to keep everything out in the open. [[User:Cunard|Cunard]] ([[User talk:Cunard|talk]]) 08:41, 22 September 2011 (UTC)\n***I agree with Cunard - I think part of the reason why this worked so well is because we were open in the discussion with no back channel communications, and also because we came to a unanimous decision (even if the exact reason why seems to be slightly different for each person). I think three people work best - if it's five, it'll take longer and you run the risk of awkward 4-1 splits - a strong consensus on one side and a significant hold-out on the other which will probably not result the original problem being conclusively closed out. With a triumvirate, if it comes back as 2-1 you know you have something which probably should be looked at at a higher level - i.e. arbcom. [[User:Tabercil|Tabercil]] ([[User talk:Tabercil|talk]]) 19:04, 23 September 2011 (UTC)\n****I would generally concur with the two above comments, in particular, that transparency is essential to the success of this approach. As I keep working in requested moves, I'll keep this in mind, and when another monster of a request comes through, I'll consider coming here to suggest this strategy again. -[[User:GTBacchus|GTBacchus]]<sup>([[User talk:GTBacchus|talk]])<\/sup> 05:45, 24 September 2011 (UTC)\n== Proposed topic ban of [[user:Jespah|Jespah]] ==\n\n{{discussion top|{{user|Jespah}} is indefinitely prohibited from editing or discussing the articles [[John Prendergast]], [[Unlikely Brothers]], [[Satellite Sentinel Project]], [[Enough Project]], [[Not On Our Watch]], and [[The Enough Moment]].  Jespah is also prohibited from editing or discussing articles insofar as the edits or discussions concern [[John Prendergast]], [[Unlikely Brothers]], [[Satellite Sentinel Project]], [[Enough Project]], [[Not On Our Watch]] or [[The Enough Moment]].\n\n::Jespah's 24 September comment is noted. The best way to have this topic ban lifted -- \"indefinite\" does not mean \"permanent\" -- would be to edit collaboratively and in accordance with site policies on articles in other topic areas. --[[User:Mkativerata|Mkativerata]] ([[User talk:Mkativerata|talk]]) 07:24, 24 September 2011 (UTC)}}\nI propose a topic ban on the user {{user|Jespah}} per [[User:OlYeller21\/Case_Studies\/Jespah|this report]] which was written solely by me, an uninvolved party.  The report is large as I try to be as thorough as possible about these sorts of things.  I ask that the report not be altered and that any new discussion take place here.\n\nThe report concludes: Jespah has been editing since December of 2008 and, as of this post, [http:\/\/toolserver.org\/~soxred93\/topedits\/index.php?name=Jespah&namespace=0 98.1% of her 1121 non-deleted mainspace edits] (I can't see the deleted ones) have been made on 7 articles.  These 7 articles are [[John Prendergast]], [[Unlikely Brothers]], [[Satellite Sentinel Project]], [[Enough Project]] [[Lisa Shannon]], [[Not On Our Watch]], [[The Enough Moment]] and are either about organizations or people who do humanitarian work in Africa.  Of the other 1.9% of her edits, all of the 21 edits are in regards to humanitarian work in Africa and\/or the subjects covered in the top 98.1% of her edits.  In short, I see not one single non-deleted mainspace edit that doesn't have to do with humanitarian work in Africa.  While this isn't an issue by itself, when paired with Jespah's ownership issues, strong personal interest in these subjects, POV pushing, and extreme lack of ability or willingness to work with other editors to improve her editing patterns, it currently makes her a detriment to WP.  Not only is she directly a detriment to the content of WP, she has tied up several other editors for an excessive amount of time which effectively impedes their ability to improve the project in other areas let alone the stress it causes them.  I can only speculate on their stress; I'll refrain so that those editors speak for themselves.\n\nI propose that Jespah be banned from editing the articles [[John Prendergast]], [[Unlikely Brothers]], [[Satellite Sentinel Project]], [[Enough Project]], [[Not On Our Watch]], and [[The Enough Moment]] as well adding information about those topics to other articles.  I'm not overly confident in this scope and ask that we use it as a starting point with the goal of allowing Jespah to edit subjects in which she is not so personally invested.  I started with what amounts to humanitarianism in Africa but I feel that it's far too broad.\n\nThis is the first time I've ever proposed a topic ban so please let me know if I've missed anything.

I do think we've reached the end of the trail for this user.  There is a continued inability to acknowledge the issue or effectively change the behavior.  I think part of the issue is Jespah's belief that this is an incredibly worthy cause, it causes her to be unable to view the issues from an encyclopedic perspective.  I support the limited topic ban proposed and hope that Jespah can try her hand at other areas and possibly come back to these topics in the future when she has gained a better understanding of encyclopedic goals. --[[User:Daniel J.

(I am, for the record, an involved party.)  OlYeller has pulled together a lot of material in admirable fashion.  The matter does, however, have a fairly voluminous history and any editor who is interested in going beyond OlYeller's report will find what I *think* is a comprehensive set of pertinent Talk page and other links on the [[User_talk:OlYeller21\/Case_Studies\/Jespah|Talk page of the report]].  [[User:JohnInDC|JohnInDC]] ([[User talk:JohnInDC|talk]]) 18:44, 19 September 2011 (UTC)\n:'''informational only''' - the deleted contributions from this editor match the pattern described. Many of them are image files created by this editor (supposedly as own work) and depict [[John Prendergast]], who is inevitably first-named as merely \"John\" in an intimate\/casual fashion. There's also a dead article on yet another organization working in the same field and for the same worthy cause. --[[User:Orangemike|<font color=\"darkorange\">Orange Mike<\/font>]]  &#x007C;  [[User talk:Orangemike|<font color=\"orange\">Talk<\/font>]] 20:13, 19 September 2011 (UTC)\n* '''Endorse''' topic ban, this looks very much like [[WP:VSCA|vanispamcruftisement]] but given the subject I suppose we should write it off to mistaken crusading zeal. Whatever, it needs to stop. <b>[[User Talk:JzG|Guy]]<\/b> <small>([[User:JzG\/help|Help!]])<\/small> 21:45, 19 September 2011 (UTC)\n* It's been a year since I first crossed paths with this editor, and, I'll admit, I'm a bit sad that it has come to this.  I had really hoped that this editor would \"see the light\" and realize that Enough and Prendergast could have nice, informative Wikipedia pages that conformed to policy.  But that is not the case.\n\n:Jespah has insisted that Enough's press be hosted on Wikipedia pages, and sees no reason why it should not be.  She has shown little interest in finding any other sourcing, and in fact sees the group's PR as perfectly neutral and reliable.  No amount of discussion has made any difference.  So, in the interests of moving on, I reluctantly '''support''' a topic ban as described above. (and thank you to Ol'Yeller, who has put a lot of time into his report.) [[User:The Interior|<font color=\"brown\">The<\/font><font color=\"green\"> Interior<\/font>]] [[User Talk:The Interior|(Talk)]] 01:11, 20 September 2011 (UTC)\n*'''Support''' topic ban. I have followed the issue for six months after seeing a report on a noticeboard, and have reluctantly concluded that Jespah will never accept advice on how articles should be written (NPOV, RS), and will never avoid an opportunity to embellish one of these articles to promote the Good Cause. It's a difficult case because the user is civil and I don't recall seeing a single edit that stands out as a clear problem (although some copyvio claims were made [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest\/Noticeboard|here]]). The issue concerns relentless advocacy for the particular group\u2014advocacy that results in considerable wasted time as other editors attempt to clean up. [[User:Johnuniq|Johnuniq]] ([[User talk:Johnuniq|talk]]) 08:32, 20 September 2011 (UTC)\n*I would point out that if you're going to topic ban a user from editing the only articles they edit, then that's pretty much tantamount to banning them entirely.

However, this isn't the place for it. --[[User:Cameron Scott|Cameron Scott]] ([[User talk:Cameron Scott|talk]]) 09:19, 20 September 2011 (UTC)\n* '''Endorse'''. I do believe it is worth assuming good faith here, but the user evidently is at best an enthusiastic proponent somewhat lacking in judgement and detachment when editing with a tenacious intent to force inclusion of these organisations' promotion. The user, a single-purpose editor, is evidently hell-bent on support for a noble cause but lacks understanding of how this attitude is inappropriate for Wikipedia. Sad, indeed, due to the article diaspora here, but true. --[[User:Tristessa de St Ange|Tristessa]] [[User_talk:Tristessa de St Ange|(talk)]] 17:04, 20 September 2011 (UTC)\n\n*'''Question''' - Is there any need to alter the proposed scope of the topic ban?  I worry that another organization may pop up and immediately fall outside of the topic ban and the issue may persist.  Perhaps that's a problem to deal with if it actually occurs.  Also, are there any other areas that we can request that editors review the situation?  I think a review of the situation by as many editors as possible would benefit everyone.

That would solve the problem you've described, though it does leave us with the issue of how to describe the articles that can't be created.  \"Humanitarian or human rights organizations relating to Africa\"?  It's hard - we don't want to be too broad but we also don't want to just push the problem (potentially) into a closely-related area that the language doesn't technically cover.  On the other hand, if the problem re-emerges, I would think that expanding this ban could be accomplished fairly expediently.

He should be the one really '''careful''' consider any article he delete that is it '''really''' deserves a speedy deletion? His obviously fault is that he was too rush on deleting articles which he thinks deserves the speedy deletion without further discuss with the author or asking the majority opinion (this is almost the same as dictator i'm thinking, which is '''not''' a good thing). Power should goes with '''big responsibility'''. This action makes me started to think how many other articles that have been deleted that should deserve to keep? And i'm pretty sure there must have been a tons (or a few) of mistaken deletion according to this. Another issue is for most members on the first article they created if those articles got deleted those people won't have any idea how to find justice for themselves like i did (because they don't know Wikipedia well enough, where they can get help) they probably got frustrated and end up give up on editing dream on Wikipedia. Well that's why the amount of new wikipedians keep '''decreasing''' over the past few years, [http:\/\/strategy.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Editor_Trends_Study\/Results here]. And why autobiography is strongly discourage? It's not like i'm writing about myself. For all i know it is strongly discourage for \"only\" those people that write about themselves. Example Jimmy Wales wrote about his article in Wikipedia = discourage. I don't see any rule that limit writing about people that notable enough and deserves to have an article on here. My last opinion here is we need more '''enforcement''' to protect '''new article''' that created my new members to avoid '''bad justice''' as good as possible to ensure to prosperous future of Wikipedia. I think we should make a rule like no admin can delete an article just base on his opinion, the admins must take the community consensus first before they take actions because the admins point of view '''can not always''' be neutral.

The articles have been deleted at times and in particular [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Michael K\u00fchntopf]] is instructive. This spamming even resulted in a thread on meta.

I also believe that references to K\u00fchntopf's work should be removed until someone can make a cogent case on a talk page regarding the value of such a reference in a given article.

In fact, while I am not familiar with the wider background, if there is some kind of old restriction that could prevent an editor from improving the project, and the editor has been constructive for a reasonable amount of time (half a year?), I'd suggest revisiting the very need for such a restriction to still be in force. --<sub style=\"border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;\">[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]&#124;[[User talk:Piotrus|<font style=\"color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;\"> talk to me<\/font>]]<\/sub> 08:32, 25 September 2011 (UTC)\n::::Your half a year and my half a year must be very different.

I don't see the point in adding a Google Books url to all books, which he claims to do for uniformity purposes, especially to those that have no preview on Google. Adding those just clutters the edit window, making it more annoying for people that actually write content in these articles without any benefit towards easier verification by the reader (ISBN does just the same to prove the books exists).

Looks to me like Delta was making a good-faith attempt to improve the encyclopedia...like he always does. I agree he has a tendency to edit right at the edge of his restrictions but what do you want the guy to do, change his entire editing philosophy and focus? That would be akin to banning him entirely. I think last time we were here (NFCC edits and being bitey was the issue) there was actually community consensus to lessen the restrictions until arbcom got involved and overruled. Not 100% sure on that and don't feel like digging through the archives at this hour. The question I must ask is, if someone makes a good-faith attempt to improve the encyclopedia, as Delta seems to do, and responds to community concerns, as Delta seems to do, then why must we bring every ''potential'' technical breach of the restrictions here? There is a key difference between the ''spirit'' of restrictions and the ''letter''. While Delta may have violated the letter he doesn't seem to have violated the spirit, which is about unauthorized bots if I recall correctly. Heck Arbcom even exempted [[User:\u0394bot]] so SPI could actually have a clerkbot. All this does is drive good-faith editors away from the project. I'm actually somewhat amazed Delta's hung around this long despite all the...stuff...he goes through on a routine basis. <span style=\"font-size:smaller;font-family:'arial bold',sans-serif;border:1px solid Black;\">[[User:N419BH|<span style=\"color:Black;background:#FFD700;\">N419<\/span>]][[User talk:N419BH|<span style=\"background:Black;color:#FFD700;\">BH<\/span>]]<\/span> 06:22, 26 September 2011 (UTC)\n:: Based on [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3A%CE%94&action=historysubmit&diff=452445659&oldid=452317812 this], he seem to blissfully ignore the opinion of others with respect to the usefulness of this latest efforts, and just carry on.

Delta's violating the letter of the law, is a continuation of his contempt for the community which has been going on for years, and frankly is directly connected to his original behaviour.

That those violating actions are or are not themselves disruptive to the encyclopedia is relevant to the degree of response, but not to the fundamental issue.

The articles I created were titled, for the most part, without diacritics as the English sources I found to verify the articles did not use diacritics. I soon discovered that there is a dedicated faction of editors who are committed to renaming all Czech biographical articles to include diacritics, verified or not. My personal opinion is that article titles should be named according to [[WP:UE]] and [[WP:COMMONNAME]], and I therefore reversed (per [[WP:BRD]]) those moves of the articles I created where no verifiable source was used to support the new article name. The massive page moves continued, and I then, perhaps naively, brought what I perceived to be \"massive page moves against policy\", to the attention of the Wikipedia community. That is when the complaints against me, from the pro diacritics crowd, started. If you will actually take a serious look at the \u201ccontroversial\u201d page moves that I made you will discover that they are not extremely numerous, and that they were generally only to undo the bold move of another editor per BRD. In any event, my work to create articles for the current notable players of the [[Czech Extraliga]] is generally completed, and I have acknowledged that my opinion in support the policies of UE and COMMONNAME is controversial, and I have moved on. In the future, if I feel that such an article should be moved, I will not invoke BRD, but will instead either ignore the issue of diacritics or will use RM.

[[User:Dolovis|Dolovis]] ([[User talk:Dolovis|talk]]) 04:11, 26 September 2011 (UTC)\n\n=== Lifting page move ban ===\nIt seems to me that Dolovis has addressed the reasons for the ban, and how his approach has changed and will remain changed. I think we can remove his restriction accordingly. I will, of course, be happy to be a first go-to administrator in the event of any problem arising from this, but I don't foresee any. <p> I'll allow another day or so for replies, and then, pending any objections, I'll be ready to close this matter as resolved. -[[User:GTBacchus|GTBacchus]]<sup>([[User talk:GTBacchus|talk]])<\/sup> 02:12, 27 September 2011 (UTC)\n\n:There's another issue, not directly related, but also connected with diacritics. Dolovis has been repeatedly adding ice hockey player names without diacritics as an argument in {{tl|eliteprospects}}, {{tl|hockeydb}} and similar templates to 100s of articles, eventhough he was warned several times that is it against [[WP:Hockey]] practice and template instructions (\"name is the player's name, use if article name has parenthesis\"). This shows to me he still isn't able to correctly work with the community. (for example [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Eero_Kilpel%C3%A4inen&diff=prev&oldid=452429531]); discussion including [[User_talk:Dolovis\/Archive_3#Changes_to_diacritics_in_external_links|here]], [[User_talk:Sporti\/Archive_3#Edit_warring|here]], [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Ice_Hockey#Template:Hockeydb_.E2.80.93_use_page_spelling_or_not.3F|here]] and  [[Wikipedia:Editor_assistance\/Requests#Proper_use_of_optional_name_field_in_external_link_templates|here]], where he started a WP:EA request, but as in other cases didn't finish it. --[[User:Sporti|Sporti]] ([[User talk:Sporti|talk]]) 05:57, 27 September 2011 (UTC)\n:: Sporti is correct, his [[red herring]] issue of how the ice hockey project chooses to use the name parameter on the [[Template:Hockeydb|Hockeydb]] and [[Template:Eliteprospects|Eliteprospects]] templates is not related to the issue of page moves or diacritics. However, to explain my position on the template name parameter issue that Sporti raised, I will use the example of [[Tiger Williams]]: To me it is just commonsense that the name parameter on the Hockeydb template should be use to show that his Hockeydb profile lists him as ''Dave \"Tiger\" Williams''[http:\/\/www.hockeydb.com\/ihdb\/stats\/pdisplay.php?pid=5735]; and likewise, the name parameter on the Eliteprospect template should be used to show that his profile at Eliteprospects lists him as ''Dave Williams''.[http:\/\/www.eliteprospects.com\/player.php?player=52429]. That was my opinion, but as soon as I realized that this was a controversial issue, I brought it up for discussion.[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AEditor_assistance%2FRequests&action=historysubmit&diff=451353924&oldid=451300314] That is how mature editors do it; not by edit warring as Sporti was doing. In any event, the discussion petered out on September 20th [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Ice_Hockey#Template:Hockeydb_.E2.80.93_use_page_spelling_or_not.3F] with the direction that hockey project wants the name parameter to be used for disambiguated (bracketed) articles only, and it is not to be used reflect a name variant as might be used at the external link itself. It is not a big deal, and I will abide by that view, and move on. I have no intention of continuing to pursuing that issue.

[[User:Newyorkbrad|Newyorkbrad]] ([[User talk:Newyorkbrad|talk]]) 02:15, 28 September 2011 (UTC)\n\n:Here's the real reason, philosophically, why Wikipedia has no age requirement.  Its the same reason why Wikipedia has no credential requirement either.  Wikipedia is based purely on results.  If an edit improves an article, it is a good edit.  If an editor makes good edits, they are welcome at Wikipedia.  Period, end of discussion.  Age (and credentials, and the like) are used in the real world as a form of [[heuristic]] when deciding if a person should be allowed to do something, usually when the consequences of doing it wrong are dire, and irreversable.  Thus, we say that you have to be 16 to drive not because 16 year olds magically become perfect drivers (at least, compared to 15 or 17 year olds), except that getting it wrong results in dire consequences (death) and 16 has been judged to be about right when most people will stop killing people with cars, and instead will use their turn signals properly (this is not the place to debate if such thinking is ''justified'', but it is still the thinking, so go with it...)  Likewise, its possible to learn to be a surgeon without a piece of paper that says you can be one; but the piece of paper is an important heuristic to decide if someone is likely to be a competant surgeon, since if they aren't, you get death.  Dire, irrevesable consequences.  At Wikipedia, however, there are zero permanent consequences.  If an edit is good, it gets kept, and if it isn't, it can be reverted with no negative effects.  So there's no need to find a heuristic to pre-screen editors in the same way there is for things like drinking, voting, driving, being a dentist, or any of a number of other real world activities.  We don't need to pre-screen anyone because you can't break Wikipedia.  Anything you do wrong can be fixed.  So Wikipedia is a purely results-driven community, and people are judged solely by what they accomplish, and other qualifications (like age, certifications, qualifications, diplomas, etc.) are completely irrelevent.  --[[User:Jayron32|<font style=\"color:#000099\">Jayron<\/font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style=\"color:#009900\">32<\/font>]]''''' 03:59, 28 September 2011 (UTC)\n::What you are saying is only an approximation to the truth. What happens at Wikipedia can have serious consequences in the real world.

Some people take Wikipedia far too seriously, and that combined with an editor being a bit unhinged might well result in a death at some point - suicides take place over a lot less sometimes.

People kill each other or commit suicide for any number of reasons, only some of which are rational. Even if \"rational\" is loosely defined. I'm not saying this to defend anything -- much less argue that some libertarian philosophy of management is the best thing for Wikipedia -- I'm simply stating what the facts are. No matter how hard we try on Wikipedia, there will be mistakes with serious repercussions. Coming up with unenforceable rules for marginal cases won't prevent them.

As far as I am concerned, the question to ask is not \"has Treasury Tag breached the specific terms of the unblock conditions\", but rather \"taking into account all the relevant history (including the unblock conditions, the user's previous 16 blocks, etc etc) would unblocking Treasury Tag again be beneficial to Wikipedia?\" To that question the answer is very clearly \"no\".

It's better to restrict someone from an activity altogether than to do so conditionally in ways that it could be argued the person couldn't know in advance if the activity would violate the restriction. That said, I've seen TT mentioned at AN\/I and AN enough times now, even defended him on occasion, to know that this goes well beyond technicalities. He has a problem with knowingly editing in ways that the community has, through consensus and through its representatives (admins) told him not to.

Maybe then, some of those AFDs I now close as \"no consensus\" after 3 weeks with no comments might start getting comments. --[[User:Ron Ritzman|Ron Ritzman]] ([[User talk:Ron Ritzman|talk]]) 13:22, 26 September 2011 (UTC)\n*******BB, please reread what I wrote.

(Again, this is true because it is an internationally popular show that no episode since its relaunch has not proven notable - this is not true across the board for any TV episode).  Yes, personally, I wouldn't be rushing to create an article on the episode once it has been announced, but I wouldn't be deleting efforts once its created because its not an issue with WP:CRYSTAL. (If anything it falls into [[WP:HAMMER]], since it lacks a name, but that's just me).  So yes, it may seem like PR while the episode hasn't aired, but I could say the same for any yet-published work, books, film, video games, etc., and really, that's more harm than good ; the wealth of development and other type of information of behind-the-scenes that are good in these articles only come about before the publication, with reception following afterwards. And basically, that's the right part of the block; it is a gross misunderstanding of CRYSTAL on TT's part; this, and other DW episodes TT's nominated, will have articles once they have aired, so it makes no sense to delete these once the BBC has affirmed they will be airing.  It becomes disruptive to do so. --[[User:Masem|M<font size=\"-3\">ASEM<\/font>]] ([[User Talk:Masem|t]]) 12:55, 26 September 2011 (UTC)\n*****If anything we would need an exception to the notability guideline stating that unaired episodes are not notable even if they otherwise qualify under GNG.

[[User:Agathoclea|Agathoclea]] ([[User talk:Agathoclea|talk]]) 13:02, 26 September 2011 (UTC)\n*****@Masem. I disagree. CRYSTAL says \"to avoid advertising and unverified claims.\" There is no way to avoid advertising when every piece of information available is part of a marketing effort by the network. This particular entry is almost entirely based on what the BBC has said about the episode. Under point 5 it also says, \"short articles that consist only of product announcement information are not appropriate.\" That is essentially what we have in cases like this. I think there are several solutions to this issue but they need to be discussed. I think you could argue, per WP:CRYSTAL, to have a stub that contains nothing except a one sentence announcement about the upcoming episode, if the episode has a number or a name. But beyond that CRYSTAL actually cautions against the type of writing that is taking place, based purely on promotional information. Consider also that writing such articles means giving the network or company and advantage once the event has happened or the product has been released, since what is already in place is their PR. Subsequent information about the actual product from third party sources now has to compete with the current consensus version, which again is crafted out of information that was originally PR. We really need a broader discussion about this if you ask me.

But to your main point I'm unsure of why there would be a problem with not having articles on topics that can't yet be covered sufficiently from independent sources, or merely having stubs with announcements until such a time that the product is actually released. Can you explain why that would be a bad thing? Is more and faster always better? I don't think so. I'm sure there is plenty of work to still be done on the entries of existing Dr. Who episodes, which can be written from independent sources.

I say again, the only source for a future Super Bowl is the NFL itself.

Similarly, there is no way of judging whether this was a good block or not without getting into the blocking editor's head. I agree with the suggestions above that TT be unblocked, and a clear restriction (can\/cannot nominate Dr. Who related articles for deletion).

In fact I believe that regardless of the unblock conditions that were the ultimate reason for the block, if TT had not haggled on almost every ''keep''-comment accross his ill-advised AFDs the issue would not have taken such proportions.

Basing blocks off AFD discussions is petty and childish.  If the discussion for some odd reason was delete we wouldn't be having this discussion.  AfD was used exactly what it was intended for, a user wants to delete something, but knows it won't survive a CSD and won't survive a PROD.  There shouldn't be any restriction on what could go to AfD (Some articles, namely FAs, will obviously be kept). <font face=\"comic sans ms\">[[User:Kwsn|<span style=\"color: #000080\">'''Kwsn'''<\/span>]] <small>[[User talk:Kwsn|<span style=\"color: #000080 \">(Ni!)<\/span>]]<\/small><\/font> 14:07, 26 September 2011 (UTC)\n*To me, reading through this and some of the AFDs, the editing restriction on knowing how an AFD will end is completely infeasible, for reasons well stated.\n*But, that doesn't mean there's a problem here. My read of what TT does with CSD\/PROD\/AFD is to throw it against a wall to see if it will stick.  (The approach in the Copyright symbol AFD is clearly one example of this).  AFD's should not be used as such grounds to gain consensus for something against the status quo, as, as we're seeing here, becomes disruptive.  I realize that any AFD could be classified in the same manner, that it is a means to see if an article should stay around.  The issue is that many of TT's AFDs are closed as kept, in some cases speedily.  To me, this indicates that TT needs to engage in some type of discussions before launching an AFD, such as by posting \"I plan to nominate this article for deletion within 7 days unless the following concerns are met\" on the talk page.  TT should then judicially use any resulting discussion and changes to determine if they go forward.  If, if it were the case of the Copyright symbol, there would be a lot of resistance to the idea, and TT did continue to go forward, that would be likely a bad faith nom.  I realize that with a show like Doctor Who you will have a dedicated editor base that will claim something is notable, and that talk page discussions won't break any stalemate created by this, and sometimes AFD is necessary to break that stalemate by garnering wider opinions.  So basically, I would say that if TT posts such a message, gets significant discuss against going forward on the AFD, still goes through with the AFD, and the AFD is speedily kept, that's an issue to deal with.  I don't know how exactly enforcable that is, as it becomes very touchy-feely.   But I think there's something there that can be enforceable and implement blocks to prevent future disruption by TT for AFDs that otherwise serve no point beyond a testing ground. --[[User:Masem|M<font size=\"-3\">ASEM<\/font>]] ([[User Talk:Masem|t]]) 14:09, 26 September 2011 (UTC)\n*''(edit conflict)''I wonder if Buffs (above) meant a 'less acrimonious editing environment'?

If, as it appears, TT's nominating for deletion has become a problem in the world of Dr Who, I would go along with a topic based ban on nominating, but with a proviso that it should be possible for TT to ask an admin to nominate on his (I assume - could be her, I know not) behalf. This may be decided to be any admin, or one of a consensus decided small number (preferably not ones involved in previous blocking or controversy - must be some...).

I am now of the opinion that TT is for inexplicable reasons unable to stop striking this particular deceased equine in a manner that provokes community backlash.\n:To protect TT from that backlash and avoid the controversy becoming an ongoing sore point, I propose the following community sanction:\n:::'''''TreasuryTag is topic banned by the Wikipedia community from article deletion of speculative fiction related articles, broadly construed.

Perhaps if he is prevented from working in AFD he can focus on improving content in other ways.

And try and write the essay before asking for comments on it. Also, look around and use the search function to find how other people organise themselves and pick up ideas from them. My advice would be to find the right balance between organisation and action. Too many people spend time writing long 'to do' lists they never start let alone finish. Sometimes you have to just get on and do things, and take time out occasionally to assess, set targets, and try and set your efforts within a larger picture. i.e. Don't overplan, but don't underplan as well. Different people balance this in different ways.

If a grouping of admins is needed, you only need a few to comment on or endorse another admin's closure, as is sometimes done at complex DRVs or MfDs. Also, the Macedonia naming dispute poll was overseen by a grouping of admins, and there are other examples as well (the triumvirate idea is not really that new, it has been suggested and used several times over the years). But (eventually, if that is what is decided should happen) any actual move discussions should be decided by community comment and vote (as was done at the end of the Ireland naming case and following the Macedonia case). The role of any admins would only be to oversee the process. [[User:Carcharoth|Carcharoth]] ([[User talk:Carcharoth|talk]]) 20:43, 2 October 2011 (UTC)\n::::Because using it at China probably saved you guys an Arbcom case - and getting three people to close that discussion has significantly reduced the number of complaints.

I don't see any arbitrators around here. The point is that ArbCom appointed people to oversee the Macedonia process and to oversee the Ireland naming discussion\/polls (I was an arbitrator at the time, but I'm not now). A moratorium on move discussions in the Ireland case was put in place for two years and largely seems to have worked. The same process could be repeated. Why switch from the previous ArbCom-initiated process to an ad hoc triumvirate system? I'm not saying that a triumvirate system doesn't have its place, but I don't think it would have helped with the Macedonia case or the Ireland case. Sometimes you need structured and lengthy, supervised discussions that actually get somewhere, rather than a single, possibly not well-publicised or well-attended discussion closed by a triumvirate, the result of which may not actually last as long as you think. Using the example of the China discussion close to push triumvirates as the solution to all move discussion ills is naive.

The ban was imposed by arbcom and the situation has been stable for those 2 years. Now there has been a new debate, and a new survey conducted which clearly shows by more than 2:1, support for the status quo.

Or is it the other way around? Cause it sure feels like that here. I've done some research into an old group called Technocracy. It is pretty interesting to me, which is why I'm researching it still, but does that automatically portray me as a Meat or Sock puppet of someone else? I tried to meet middle ground on an edit war which occurred on the [[Technocracy Movement]] article. It was immediately reverted and I was accused of being a sock puppet and meat puppet of another user who was banned a few years ago. It also happened 7 months back when I was another user [[User talk:Googlesalot|talk]] which you can see I expressed on my talk page....and from that user page you could find who I was when I didn't have an account. I think my edits were neutral and at the time seem non controversial. Until I kept on getting reverted and labeled a sock\/meat puppet of the same user I mentioned earlier. I just want to know is this how wikipedia operates because it makes it very difficult to even contribute to something you seem lacking in encyclopedic material. That is why I started editing there. Because when I was researching the group and information related to Technocracy I found there was quite a bit of wrong information and even material that seemed very negative. Like calling the organization \"fascistic\" here [[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Technocracy_Incorporated&diff=410668130&oldid=410662096]]. I've even tried to talk about the issues on the talk board and still get zero responses from the editors who are reverting and accusing me.

[[User:28bytes|28bytes]] ([[User talk:28bytes|talk]]) 07:13, 1 October 2011 (UTC)\n\n:I think some history is in order here. Some years ago we had two editors, acting in tandem, who strongly pushed a pro-[[technocracy]] POV on Wikipedia; the editors were {{user|Skipsievert}}, who was indef blocked in November 2009 (see [[Wikipedia:Fringe theories\/Noticeboard\/Archive 16#Skip sievert and economics|here]]) and {{user|AdenR}}. In February 2011, we again had two pro-technocracy editors acting in tandem who engaged in disruptive POV pushing at [[Technocracy movement]] and [[Technocracy Incorporated]]; the editors were {{user|FidelDrumbo}} and {{user|Googlesalot}}. And now we again have two pro-technocracy editors acting in tandem who have engaged in disruptive POV pushing at various Technocracy-related articles; the editors are {{user|FidelDrumbo}} and {{user|Googlesalot2}}. The pattern of editing is the same in each case, only the names are different. [[User:Johnfos|Johnfos]] ([[User talk:Johnfos|talk]]) 16:18, 1 October 2011 (UTC)\n\n:To read what Googlesalot2 has said above you would think that he is one of the best editors we have on WP, not a [[WP:SPA]]. G has said several times above that his edits are non-controversial, but that is far from the truth. Consider [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Technocracy_movement&diff=next&oldid=452922138 this edit]. POV pushing is evident in that anything that may have portrayed the limitations of technocracy has simply been removed from the page. The statement that technocracy reached its peak in the early 1930s has been removed, and  G generally portrays the technocracy movement as a vibrant going concern in 2011. Reliable sources have been removed. The edit summary does not adequately describe what has been done. As often happens, Googlesalot2, has directed any editors who disagree with what he has done to the Talk page; a better approach is to discuss controversial changes on the Talk page before they are made. [[User:Johnfos|Johnfos]] ([[User talk:Johnfos|talk]]) 00:38, 2 October 2011 (UTC)\n\n::::To add to Johnfos's history, the background disruption extends well beyond technocracy articles into sustainability and economic areas. Lawrencekhoo (above) has experience with the disruption to economic articles. In the sustainability area, the massive disruption of Skipsievert and his later partnership with AdenR is apparent in [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Search?search=Skipsievert&prefix=Talk%3ASustainability%2F&fulltext=Search&fulltext=Search these talk page archives]. Skipsievert stymied progress on this particular article for over a year, co-opting AdenR as the pressure built. You can quickly get the flavour of this disruption by searching on Skipsievert in [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Talk:Sustainability\/Archive_27 this archive]. To get another perspective on just how destructive Skipsievert is to the project, here are some ANIs about him: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard\/IncidentArchive571#Incorrigibly_disruptive_editor][http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard\/IncidentArchive575#Attacks_at_AfD][http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard\/IncidentArchive676#Technocracy_POV_pushing][http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard\/IncidentArchive467#Disruptive_editor_Skipsievert] and here are some other postings to noticeboards: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment\/Skipsievert][http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Wikiquette_assistance\/archive75#User:Skipsievert_talk_page_postings][http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Wikiquette_assistance\/archive59#User:Johnfos][http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration\/Requests\/Case&oldid=324751616#Skipsievert][http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Editor_assistance\/Requests\/Archive_43#Difficulties_resolving_NPOVD_in_article_Energy_Accounting][http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest\/Noticeboard\/Archive_30#Sustainability_article_and_Sustainable_gardens.2C_landscapes_and_sites] As Johnfos points out above, FidelDrumbo\/Googlesalot now operate on technocracy articles with the same MO as Skipsievert\/AdenR. Skipsievert and FidelDrumbo both occasionally resort to IP edits when they want to do additional reverts, and the location of those IPs match. Googlesalot appears just in the nick of time when FidelDrumbo needs him, just as AdenR did, in a manner that cannot just be coincidence. That is why I referred to Googlesalot as a meatpuppet. --[[User:Epipelagic|Epipelagic]] ([[User talk:Epipelagic|talk]]) 04:16, 2 October 2011 (UTC) <small>FidelDrumbo has just now [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Technocracy_movement&diff=453479863&oldid=453353298 reverted] the [[Technocracy movement]] article back to his POV, with an edit comment typical of the way Skipsievert games the system. --[[User:Epipelagic|Epipelagic]] ([[User talk:Epipelagic|talk]]) 05:00, 2 October 2011 (UTC)<\/small>\n\n::I don't \"tandem\" edit or \"POV\" push.

You tandem edit with both editors in question http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User_talk:Epipelagic and http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Lawrencekhoo. You all revert to same disputed material.

I Want to continue the conversation from the past noticeboard material as it has some relevance here. User epipelagic came out of no where and started accusing me.

[[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard\/Incidents&diff=prev&oldid=415964665]]. \n\n::I honestly think these users are working together to obstruct progress on the technocracy articles. They obviously knew or where in contact with user:skip and now want to \"get back\" by POV pushing negative material in the Technocracy articles.\n\n: I want to thank Johphos for actually trying to discuss the issues on the technocracy article. Thank you. Why can't you do that on the talk page? Here's  a the quote in question.\n:::''Technocracy's heyday lasted only from June 16, 1932, when the ''New York Times'' became the first influential press organ to report its activities, until January 13, 1933, when Scott, attempting to silence his critics, delivered a rambling, confusing, and uninspiring address on a well-publicized nationwide radio hookup''\n: I think the quote is fine except for the second part which is a bit strange to have. I'm guessing it's okay to put on the article since it is quoted material...but I thought any quoted material can be deleted if it is disputed? I'd be fine if it was written more neutrally and not a direct quote.  [[User:Googlesalot2|Googlesalot2]] ([[User talk:Googlesalot2|talk]]) 01:36, 2 October 2011 (UTC)\n\n::Johnphos has an ax to grind as to controlling some articles connected to that subject. I am not connected to any former parties mentioned, my account is not.\n::Apparently if anyone shows up on Wikipedia to edit the Technocracy related articles they have to put up with edit warring from Johnphos and his cohorts already mentioned by another editor here in a negative light as to their editing. \nLooking at the history here it seems that Johphos does not ''like'' having a neutral presentation of the material on the Technocracy movement and the articles on the founding organization was repeatedly attempted by Johnphos to delete. The most notable group connected to Technocracy, he wanted to get rid of the article entirely. His arguments of those articles for deletion he created himself is telling  http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion\/Technocracy_Incorporated ... it appears he is casting around for negative and non neutral edits on this subject.\n::Looking at another player who reverts and edit wars there is a pattern of making as negative of an article on this subject as is possible.\nCalling an organization ''fascist'' that is still around or editing to imply fascism is not accurate. The actual group was against fascism http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/GreatLakesTechnocrat-JulyAugust1947 but that information by some source keeps returning that they were a fascist group somehow. It is libelous maybe to a currently running group or at least not accurate at all to present it that way, not neutral. \n\n::Simple things like saying 'demise' of something is reverted. Demise means death or of something being over, and as an historic organization from the 1930's that is still around again it is not accurate to say it ''demised'' itself in the 1930's but that is the edit that is being negatively done by Johnphos. Read this article by a government website about the current status of that group, scroll down to the ''Technocracy'' section in the social security government website, these are the kinds of links that Johnphos has taken off http:\/\/www.ssa.gov\/history\/briefhistory3.html\n\n::Johnphos does not seem to care on neutral editing this material, to have articles controlled by little groups that want to slant things negatively and then accuse of socks and puppets and so forth when challenged, instead of making talk page discussion.\n\n::Johnphos who claims to be retired mostly from editing is a constant watchdog of putting old and not accurate info back into this article and as said tried a couple of times to have other articles connected ''deleted'' and does not contribute on the talk page as the other two people he edits with also do not. Wikipedia is a joke in many ways when tiny editing parties try to control presentation and then claim those that differences are part of an editing plot. Mostly I have ignored his insults and accusations but was alerted on my talk page to come here. \n\n::Looking at the history of Lawrence Khoo on these articles also being mentioned as a tandem editor with Johnphos it seems that he is a mainstream economist in the real world who also is enforcing negative edits and possibly is disgruntled by differing information from his published points of view. That seems pretty wrong if true and a problem with ''experts'' that try to control info on en. Wikipedia seems like a bad wrinkle and a non neutral trap. In other words its a competing system from his views and he seems to regard it with disdain and negative not accurate edits.

Also, what do opinions on the perception of the technocracy movement have ''anything to do with the issues brought up on this board''? The issues are that you and your two Wikipedia friends User: Lawrencekhoo and User:epipelagic are accusing an editor(me) of sock puppetry on nothing but flimsy opinions. You revert my edits which should't be controversial, and if they are then you three should at least talk about the issues on the talk page or at least revert the edits you contend instead of the whole revert.  I honestly can't understand how you can come on here and talk about what I have done on the wikipedia articles as \"very sad\" when you barely try to work on the issues you believe I've done. I've tried to meet middle ground when you were editing warring with user:Fideldrumbo by just fixing two edits I saw as bad encyclopedic material. Like the \"fascist implications\" and the \"rambling, confusing radio address quote\". I immediately get reverted by your friend user:epipelagic instead of discussing it on the talk page which I have ask you all to do. All I get from you three is no responses and you guys just revert my edits. I've even tried to talk to you and user epipelagic directly and you guys just ignore me or delete your message off your talk pages. What kind of constructive behavior is that! This is why I believe you guys have some serious axes to grind that you must accuse an editor of sock puppetry just so you can keep the article to YOUR liking. When this is WIKIPEDIA where users can edit ''freely''. It sure doesn't feel welcoming of Wikipedia to have to go to an article, edit and then get accused of sock puppetry from nowhere. [[User:Googlesalot2|Googlesalot2]] ([[User talk:Googlesalot2|talk]]) 02:53, 3 October 2011 (UTC)\n\nThere is [[WP:DUCK|clear behavioral evidence]] that FidelDrumbo and Googlesalot are socks. For example, Skipsievert used to insinuate that editors he was edit warring against were 'under investigation' by Wikipedia for bad behavior, just as FidelDrumbo did [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Technocracy_movement&action=historysubmit&diff=453479863&oldid=453353298 here]. And [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Skipsievert&diff=prev&oldid=453014759 here], FidelDrumbo goes to Skipsievert's talk page to remove an ANI notice. Googlesalot also shows amazingly good knowledge of Wikipedia's workings and terms for a supposedly new editor that has made a total of 43 edits for both accounts (including talk page edits, this ANI report and page reverts). I have filed a detailed SPI report on this matter. Please see [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations\/Skipsievert here].

The position is that Skipsievert\/FidelDrumbo are socks of each other, and AdenR\/Googlesalot\/Googlesalot2 are socks of each other. From the behavioural evidence, there can be no doubt that is the case. In addition, AdenR+ clearly behaves as a meatpuppet of Skipsievert+. --[[User:Epipelagic|Epipelagic]] ([[User talk:Epipelagic|talk]]) 16:06, 4 October 2011 (UTC) \n\n: Wow, just wow.

I guess learning from others is an experienced editor thing? And apparently reading some articles every now and then on how to edit Wikipedia and applying that knowledge also makes me guilty?  Now, after ''reading'' what I'm really accused of...which is a sock puppet of a '''probable''' sock puppet or meat puppet(AdenR) of skip seivert(was he a sock puppet too?), this is honestly becoming a circus. I'm not going to argue this anymore. It's sad. I'm not connected to any other users. I'm surprised admins haven't blocked you three or made a notice or something. I guess I don't really understand how Wikipedia works. I probably won't edit here again...maybe every now and then(won't lose my password this time, I might have to go through this all over again!). Heck, maybe another user will get accused as well of being a sock puppet of a sock puppet of a sock puppet cause they want to edit a few things on the Technocracy articles.

I'm not sure about the rules on tandem editing as I have not found any articles on that yet. \n\n''''Johnphos''''\n\nThis editor has shown considerable signs of pushing his POV. For example, I've raised issues of this on the [[Technocracy Incorporated]] talk page starting [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Talk:Technocracy_Incorporated#Disputed_paragraph| here] I brought up a legitimate issue from the standpoint that a particular piece of information was confusing and not really appropriate for the article. It contained references to authoritarianism and fascism when the group specifically denies such claims as I proved on the talk page. [[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Technocracy_Incorporated&diff=prev&oldid=326417071| Here's a link]] of the original material user Johnfos put into the article. There's no explanation as to why or what 'implications' it was referring to. The material was also explaining an aspect of the  [[Technocracy Movement]] and not the organization specifically which made the material pointless in the article.  [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Technocracy_Incorporated&diff=prev&oldid=410825072| He gave a small reply] with no reasonable argument to defend his edit and ended up reverting me anyway. He then puts a POV tag on the article [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Technocracy_Incorporated&diff=next&oldid=415621528| and explains it here].

There was an RM discussion in May.  The consensus then was unanimous to move it.  The issue of ENGVAR was not directly raised, but the implication was clear that all those involved did not think it applied since the proposed spelling was commonly used in the established variant (British) of the article, which is all that ENGVAR requires.<p>In this particular discussion, there was no consensus ''to move'', and there was certainly no consensus about the previous discussion being a violation of ENGVAR.  In fact, {{User|LtPowers}} made a strong argument explaining why ENGVAR did not apply, and this was not addressed, much less refuted.  GTB ignored all of this, not even making a mention of it.  His closing comment simply presumed that ENGVAR applied, without explanation.  These are the reasons why I said it was a horrible close and contrary to consensus.<p>Frankly, I was hoping that GTB would recognize his error and reverse his decision, but apparently that's not going to happen.  --[[User:Born2cycle|Born2cycle]] ([[User talk:Born2cycle|talk]]) 02:20, 6 October 2011 (UTC)\n::It's only makes sense to say \"recognize his error,\" if it's clear that I made an error.

Dolovis posted to my talk page, but there was a reply from [[User:Djsasso]] that he agreed with the objection raised by [[User:Mjroots]]. That objection was raised before Dolovis' explanation that satisfied me, and Mjroots never responded to Dolovis' assurances that he won't use page moves the way he did before. If nobody's even going to address these assurances, then I don't get what's going on.\n\nI request that Dolovis be allowed to move pages again, conditional on keeping his word that he won't revert any page move, and that he won't treat any diacritic-related move as uncontroversial. If he doesn't stick to these conditions, then I fully support re-instituting the move ban.\n\nOpinions? -[[User:GTBacchus|GTBacchus]]<sup>([[User talk:GTBacchus|talk]])<\/sup> 18:59, 30 September 2011 (UTC)\n:In particular, here is Mjroots comment: \"''Per the others above. Use WP:RM for now, once you can demonstrate that you are not going to cause disruption with page moves, the community will consider whether or not to lift the ban.''\" I think that's been demonstrated. If that's not the case, then I think it's fair to ask concretely what it would take to make such a demonstration. -[[User:GTBacchus|GTBacchus]]<sup>([[User talk:GTBacchus|talk]])<\/sup> 19:02, 30 September 2011 (UTC)\n\n::If I'm interpreting the above correctly, Dolovis has indicated that he'll use [[WP:RM]] for any diacritic-related moves... is that correct?

Now I fully realize not many moves happen very often. But the source of his issues were mostly moving ice hockey player pages (with diacritics specifically). Since the last two months were the summer outside of hockey season the likelihood of him making ice hockey player moves were next to zero. I think it would take a bigger body of work to judge than the 4 move requests he showed in the earlier discussion. That being said he has so far stopped his double edits to prevent others from moving over top of redirects so it does look like he is moving in the right direction. -[[User:Djsasso|DJSasso]] ([[User talk:Djsasso|talk]]) 19:32, 30 September 2011 (UTC)\n:::I don't see the point. We'll keep an eye on his page moves. Does he have to find a bunch of pages to nominate for moving to get out from under the gun? This isn't grade-school. Let me be a... cosigner for him.

However, if the ban is to be lifted, I'd like an assurance and understanding from Dolovis that he can't just move pages, regardless of whether he believes he is in the right or not. I'm not convinced that a ''complete'' page-move ban is preventative, but he should stay away from moving diacritics articles. He should at least be allowed to perform moves that simply correct any typo errors. <small>GTBacchus, in the future, remember to notify the parties when starting a noticeboard discussion.<\/small> [[User:Heymid|<span style=\"color:green;\">Hey<\/span>]][[User talk:Heymid|<span style=\"color:red;\">'''''Mid'''''<\/span>]] ([[Special:Contributions\/Heymid|contribs]]) 22:38, 30 September 2011 (UTC)\n:::Thanks for that reminder, Heymid.

If Dolovis is agreeing that his diacritic page moves and double edits to redirects so as to prevent non-administrator intervention were disruptive and that he will not resume the same pattern of editing, then the restriction is no longer required.  It can, of course, be easily reinstated if old behaviours resurface. [[User:Resolute|Reso]][[User Talk:Resolute|lute]] 03:33, 1 October 2011 (UTC)\n:I'm happy with that.

I just wanted to make sure it was clear is all. He has in the past when he got stopped from doing one thing found another way to create the same problems but in a different venue so his assurances don't hold as much weight as they might another editor.

That's what we all do, or we'll all be speedy-banned and beaten silly with trouts and clue-by-fours. No fun. <p> Side note: I've developed the habit of never editing a redirect after I move a page. I want to make sure than its easy for someone to revert me if they need to. Sticking to a policy like that also saves you ever being accused of editing redirects to prevent your moves being reverted, which is kind of nice, because those conversations are unenlightening and not really related to encyclopedia-building, when you get right down to it. -[[User:GTBacchus|GTBacchus]]<sup>([[User talk:GTBacchus|talk]])<\/sup> 05:00, 4 October 2011 (UTC))\n*** Actually, I am being held to a higher standard than others.

I was banned for making double-edits to redirect pages (which I did in an a naive attempt to slow down the controversial moves), not actually for the page moves themselves, which were few and far between.

Note that is about the action I would like to take in general, not about the particular situation or the actions of the other participants, so I have not notified them and expect no action from administrators with regard to them or the page in question (and I don't ''really'' want to bring them into it, because it would just transfer a personal dispute over here - no sense in that).  This is just used as an example of a general concept that I want permission for.\n\nThe action in question is the in-line archiving of trouble-making statements.  example as follows:\n* I ask that we find an admin to close an expired RfC (one that's been trouble-ridden) [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Pregnancy&diff=prev&oldid=453903190]\n* and editor responds with a valid comment that is wrapped in innuendos and personal attacks (a reasonable assertion that RfC's are not votes, preceded by accusations that the request is provocative, unhelpful, and inappropriate, and followed by the suggestion that I am somehow violating wikipedia procedures) [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Pregnancy&diff=next&oldid=453903190]\n* a couple of posts later, I obscure the offensive material with an in-line template (as well as removing my own somewhat pithy response to it), without changing the meaning of the post.  [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Pregnancy&diff=next&oldid=453984677]\nNote that this is already technically allowable under [[wp:TPO]], [[wp:TPNO]] and [[wp:RPA]], it just hasn't been legitimized as a practice.  That's what I want to address.\n\nThe reasons I would like this legitimized are two-fold:\n# On the community side: comments like that add nothing to the page: they are at best ''ad hominem'' gambits designed to prejudice uninvolved readers against one side of the discussion and at worst efforts at [[wp:BAIT|BAIT]]ing intended to enrage an opponent.  They really have no place on talk pages anywhere, and do nothing except gum up the page with defensive explanations and counter-accusations.\n# On the personal side: while I am generally level-headed, I have a ''very'' bad temper if I get pushed far enough, and when I lose my temper it inevitably gets exceedingly ugly (that's just a fact; sorry).  It would do a lot to help keep me from reaching that point if I were allowed to obscure insulting comments of this sort.  Obscuring the insult precludes the need to respond to the nonsense and allows me to focus on the productive aspects of the discussion.\nOf course, this would apply all ways; I would have no problem with someone doing the same to my posts, so long as they were careful not to change the meaning of what I say.  If this were legitimized as a matter of consensus it would not need administrator intervention (not much, anyway).  The distinction between content-related material and personal commentary is not all that blurry, and once the right to redact personal denigrations is established, editors can find a balance about what stays in talk and what is excised on their own (as opposed to the current situation, where editors will immediately revert to restore even the most insulting statements, and the effort to remove the insults often approaches the level of edit warring).  \n\nAll-in-all, it would make talk pages more congenial, and it would make me a ''much'' happier camper.  win-win, as far as I'm concerned.  Can we reach a consensus on this?  --[[User_talk:Ludwigs2|<span style=\"color:darkblue;font-weight:bold\">Ludwigs<\/span><span style=\"color:green;font-weight:bold\">2<\/span>]] 23:28, 4 October 2011 (UTC)\n\n:This sort of behavior can, and has, also be used as a tactic for controlling or misrepresenting the conversation by selectively hiding certain parts and not others.  Many editors, myself included, do not feel that editting of others' comments on talk pages is an acceptable behavior at all, except in very extreme cases, and as such this sort of behavior is more often than not an open invitation to talk page edit warring.  Ludwigs2's own history of using hat-hiding on [[Talk:Pregnancy]] is an excellent example of this potential problem.  The best response to baiting comments is to simply not bite, robbing the baiter of any effect or power. [[User:Variable|siafu]] ([[User talk:Variable|talk]]) 00:20, 5 October 2011 (UTC)\n:Not uninvolved in the immediate history of Ludwig2's behavior on this point, but strongly disagree with refactoring, especially by the target. I used to try doing it between third parties, and results were mixed at best, and that was in a calmer time. I've since learned it is almost never (never say never, lest an impish deity make you eat your words) a good idea.

[[User:Variable|siafu]] ([[User talk:Variable|talk]]) 05:46, 5 October 2011 (UTC)\n\n::::The problem there, Siafu, is that I used it far too late in the discussion, after we'd all lost our tempers and had a huge, collective hissy-fit.  At the point where I recovered my aplomb and tried to apply it I'd already engendered a whole lot of bad blood and was faced with editors who were dead-set on contradicting anything I did.  Had I had the presence of mind to begin with it early in the discussion (back around the 6th of september, when people first started using ''mild'' personal comments as elements of their arguments), it would have been a different matter.  People would have been less emotionally invested in the dispute, more willing to consider the idea that such comments were not in the best interests of the talk page, and disinclined to dogmatically edit war solely to keep rude personal comments in.  After a discussion has reached the stage where editors firmly believe that attacking other editors is correct and necessary, nothing is going to save the page short of an admin stepping in with [[nuclear deterrent|dire promises]].  Done early and conscientiously, however, this could have saved the page from making that decent into madness.\n\n::::Had someone applied this to ''my'' posts I would not have reverted.  I might have adjusted their edit if I thought they removed too much, but I would never fight to maintain some supposed right to be rude to other editors.  I think most of us would behave in the same way when we are in our right minds; it's only when we are in a fight that that kind of commentary seems meaningful and important.  Anyone who really believes it is necessary to address the character or personality of another editor has user talk pages, Wikiquette, RfC\/U, AN and ANI, and other venues in which to do that.  There is no need for it in article talk, where it merely muddies the waters so that no effective ''content'' discussions can occur.\n\n::::I am asking to legitimize a practice by which we can moderate each other's behavior. If we are not permitted to moderate each other, then many pages will be (as many pages currently are) dominated by immoderate behavior.  As Truman (I think) once reputedly said, the easiest way to win at politics is to call your opponent a pig-fucker and force him to deny it; He didn't say that approvingly, though, and we should not accept it as the wikipedia norm. --[[User_talk:Ludwigs2|<span style=\"color:darkblue;font-weight:bold\">Ludwigs<\/span><span style=\"color:green;font-weight:bold\">2<\/span>]] 10:00, 5 October 2011 (UTC)\n\n{{od}}Maybe I'm crazily out of step with the community, but it seems to me that if you're involved in the conversation, and especially if what you want to refactor is directed at you, then no way should you be editing that person's comments. If they're terrible, horrible attacks, raise the issue with an admin or a neutral third party, and see if they decide to carry out a redaction, but I can imagine no universe in which editing one's opponent's negative comments about oneself can end in any way but drama. Don't do it.  [[User:Fluffernutter|A fluffernutter is a sandwich!]] ([[User talk:Fluffernutter|talk]]) 14:05, 5 October 2011 (UTC)\n\n:Ok, I'll make one last (long) comment, and then I'll leave it to you all to discuss or ignore this as you see fit (unless there are particular questions aimed at me).\n\n:Fluffernutter: by making that statement, you condemn certain pages to endless, vicious warfare.  I know that's not your intention, but that is the inevitable (if unexpected) result of that particular belief.  It is a matter of the nature of human social interaction. In normal social interactions, people have any number of mutual-moderation tactics, ones that are either biological or deeply rooted in pre-verbal socialization.  You know this and you do this, regularly; there's not a question about it.  if you are in a conversation with someone who begins to become emotionally stressed, you are quickly aware of it and you instinctively react - changing your body posture, your facial expressions, your vocal tone; making certain sounds (e.g. the ubiquitous 'small cough') or certain gestures (e.g. that palm-down 'chill-dude' hand gesture) - all in order to check the other's emotional outburst before it gets out of hand.  I'm not even going to bother claiming that this is good or necessary: it's evolutionary.  Infants are proficient at it by the time they are six months old, and it only gets more deeply rooted in us over time.\n\n:On the internet, none of that works.  None of it!  All of the non-verbal cues that we implicitly rely on to moderate other people's emotions (and instinctively respond to so that others can moderate our own) are entirely absent.  It's almost exactly like tearing the rudder off a ship. You may not see that the rudder is gone because it's below your level of perception, but it becomes ''significantly'' harder to steer a proper course in a conversation.  Now, the majority of the time we manage, mostly because people don't get emotionally involved with topics all that often and most people are generally considerate of others as a matter of intellectual principle.  But as soon as someone becomes emotionally attached to a position on Wikipedia, it is a line straight to hell, because all of our evolutionary mechanism for moderating others' emotions rely on the other person being able to see us, or hear us or be touched by us.  Without those, we go back to more primal mechanisms for moderating others' emotions: the screeching, head-butting, feces-throwing tactics common among chimpanzees and other primates.\n\n:What you're advocating, as reasonable as it sounds, is effectively (to coin a term) Wikicidal.  It only works were people are capable of maintaining a strict division between their intellectual and emotional lives, and on certain topics and concepts (nudity being one, but I can also point to religious issues, political issues, social issues, even silly stuff like fringe science) there are going to be people who cannot separate their intellect from their emotions, and there is going to be conflict because talk pages lack all of the socio-biological cues that would normally tell such people they are stepping over the line.  What you are left with in those situations is conflicts that escalate endlessly because no one (in the moment) can see that their behavior is out of line, because there is ''nothing to see'' except the righteousness of their own anger.\n\n:This is the advantage of obscuration templates.  It gives people something to ''see'': a visible token that their actions are out of line.  It's a surrogate for all the missing socio-biological cues.  If it's legitimized as a practice, then people will quickly come to respond to it the same way they respond to a raised eyebrow or a hand gesture, and we will save endless amounts of trouble across the project.  It's not a panacea, obviously, but it would certainly keep the sillier arguments (those that are based mostly in misperceptions and hurt feelings) from ever getting off the ground.  \n\n:I can't really explain it any better than that, and if you all still don't think it's a good idea\u2026  well, Wikipedia has had monkey-shit-throwing contests since day one, and we can continue to have them as long as you like.  it frankly irritates the hell out of me - partly because I tend to work on pages where people tend to have strong emotional attachments (which gets me in a lot of trouble) and partly because I can't help but think that it's unbearably dumb to allow this to happen to otherwise reasonable discussions.  I hear admins complain frequently about these kinds of kerfluffles, and I see these kinds of kerfluffles end up at ANI on a daily basis with no end in sight.  I don't understand why you resist what might be a simple and straightforward way of snipping off many of these conflicts in the bud.  But at the end of the day, as admins, it's always going to fall back on you: if you don't start encouraging something that stops these conflicts early, it's going to be one of you descending on a drama-ridden page to corral out-of-control disputes, and there will always be pages where that is necessary.   It's your bed: you should make it the way you want it to be, because you're the ones who have to lie in it.  --[[User_talk:Ludwigs2|<span style=\"color:darkblue;font-weight:bold\">Ludwigs<\/span><span style=\"color:green;font-weight:bold\">2<\/span>]] 16:18, 5 October 2011 (UTC)\n\n*Regarding using {{tl|nono}} or hatting or similar on comments directed at you: per Tnzkai and Fluffernutter, this is almost guaranteed to make things worse.  Don't do it.  If it's a one-off then ignore it, if it's chronic then ask for help.  Regarding using {{tl|nono}} as a third party: I've done it a few times, with mixed results. The biggest problem is that it muddies the waters about what the dispute is about.  If you use it as an uninvolved party, I'd really recommend ''not'' reinstating it if you're reverted by the original author, but going another route (warning\/blocking) instead. --[[User:Floquenbeam|Floquenbeam]] ([[User talk:Floquenbeam|talk]]) 15:18, 5 October 2011 (UTC)\n*:Floquenbeam (p.s. from edit conflict with my last post): I'm sorry, but I can't take that advice as written; it will put me in a position where I am likely to lose my temper, and I am trying to set up conditions where I can avoid that.  I will compromise as follows, though: if I use this tactic I will redact once and revert once (if the redaction is reverted), and if it's reverted after that I will open an ANI case.  The single revert is necessary, both to give the other person a chance to reflect on whether the removed material is really worth fighting over and to demonstrate at ANI that there is a determined effort to keep the defamatory material visible in talk.  Is that acceptable?  --[[User_talk:Ludwigs2|<span style=\"color:darkblue;font-weight:bold\">Ludwigs<\/span><span style=\"color:green;font-weight:bold\">2<\/span>]] 16:41, 5 October 2011 (UTC)\n:::If your goal is to de-escalate the situation, as it sounds like you're explaining it to be, then no, that's probably not acceptable. Revert warring (planning to revert their reversion rather than discuss sounds a whole lot like \"Hey, I'm going to edit war, but it's ok because I'll only do it once each time\") over something that you have now been told (and seen for yourself) multiple times is likely to ''anger'' your opponents is never going to be helpful in making them ''less'' angry. More acceptable, though no more likely to calm down the situation, would be to say that you will redact once and then not again if someone objects to your action. Your opponent then would still be angry and inflamed by your redaction, but not ''more'' angered by your redacting and then fighting over it. \n:::Even better than what you're suggesting is is a simple solution: do not get into conflicts where you or your opponents are losing your tempers. If tempers flare, back away rather than throwing more fuel on the fire by editing your opponent's words. Ask for help from a neutral party, post on a noticeboard, go have a cup of tea...do ''anything'' but continue to engage in a situation where you can't hold your temper and want to take an action that you know will cause someone to lose theirs.

People '''REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY''' don't like having their comments redacted, and I haven't ever seen ''one'' case where someone \"redacting\" comments, in the name of civility, actually led to an increase of civility. What happens is whoever redacts is piled on, dismissed as an agent of the thought police by whoever's side you censored, heralded as a hero by the opposing side, and now you end up with a meta-debate on whether such actions are appropriate, you end up at ANI,  then warning,  blocks and desysops are issued. It ''never'' stops drama, and if the goal was to bring the heat down, then you've just shot yourself in the foot because you ensured that the heat would rise up to white-hot levels. Yes people should try to be civil and focus on the actual problem, rather than saying \"that's just retarded\" or similar. However sometimes, there are behaviours and viewpoints that are \"just retarded\", and it's perfectly appropriate to call a spade a spade. WP:AGF is not a suicide pact.

Did it manage to reduce tensions?  Did it redirect the conversation to being on topic?  Did it smooth over the bile that was building?  The answers are no, no, and no.  This should really carry much more weight than any supposed or possible outcome.  The very fact that you have had to come here to obtain some sort of legitimization for this behavior is in and of itself evidence that it has not been successful, and is heavily resisted and resented by the users you have been using it on. If it were a good idea, it would have been self-evident from the effect it had. [[User:Variable|siafu]] ([[User talk:Variable|talk]]) 17:09, 5 October 2011 (UTC)\n\n:Siafu: In fact, experience - 'case studies', as you put it - show that this ''does'' work.  it worked on talk:pregnancy the minute an admin stepped in and started redacting material; that chilled-out the discussion on the talk page immediately.  It works almost every time an admin steps into a fray because admins have a ''community-legitimized'' power, and the mere presence of an active admin will often get people to start behaving correctly.  All I'm suggesting is that we extend that power to normal editors by legitimizing the behavior publicly.  once that's done, people will respect editor redactions of inappropriate material the same way that they respect admin redactions, and it will save admins from having to intervene except in the most extreme cases.\n\n:I have used this to good effect as well even though I'm not an admin (not on this page: as I said, I started too late), but that is more a function of my personality than anything else - I know how to present myself with a degree of intellectual and moral authority that sometimes substitutes for my otherwise complete lack of power.  But the effort here is to remove it from personality and establish it as a community norm; once that is done, it will be respected to everyone's benefit.  Yes, people will balk at it at first - the way that young children often balk at toilet training and young adults often balk at committing themselves to a career - but people they will get over it and adapt, and it will benefit them and the community.   --[[User_talk:Ludwigs2|<span style=\"color:darkblue;font-weight:bold\">Ludwigs<\/span><span style=\"color:green;font-weight:bold\">2<\/span>]] 18:28, 5 October 2011 (UTC)\n\n::This isn't about admins stepping in to hat conversations, this is about individual editors doing so with comments by people who are currently in the process of vigorously disagreeing with them.  Seriously, step back and look this over: not one commenter has supported this idea as a good one, the admins who have commented have noted that even 3rd party admins have had limited success with this method, and when you yourself have recently attempted it you have sparked revert wars, inflamed tensions, and created hostility and antagonism.  Even when not abused, this sort of refactoring will serve primarily to make people angry, as the message that is given is that their comments and input are being discarded simply out of hand.  Even worse, it can be (and has been) so easily abused by regular editors, in the form of selectively removing some comments while leaving others intact-- this complaint should sound very familiar, as it was brought up repeatedly on [[Talk:Pregnancy]].  Why would you expect this refactoring to receive a different response in the future?  [[User:Variable|siafu]] ([[User talk:Variable|talk]]) 18:38, 5 October 2011 (UTC)\n\n:::That's a misrepresentation of what I said, and a misrepresentation of the situation, and a misrepresentation of the concept.

People can already do it if they want to, and people who are inclined to squabble already have plenty of tools to squabble with.  One more tool to misuse will make no meaningful difference to the level of nastiness on the project.\n:::# This might make the project better.  If my 'eloquent theorizing' (as you put it) has any merits, it ''will'' make the project better.\n:::I'm not sure why you're opposed to this, and I'm not going to speculate.  What I will suggest is that you are neatly screwing yourself (and the project as a whole) out of a tool that cannot do any harm and may do a lot of good.  As I said, the project can go on with the same old monkey-shit disputes it's always had, or it can try to do something different and better.  This practice is not going to ''cause'' those disputes, and it might help to solve them, and I can not make any sense at all out of your resistance to it.\n\n:::I mean seriously: If this is about me (on the assumption you're one of that number of people who have a deep dislike for me personally), then steal the idea and make it your own.  I don't care about getting the credit for it, I just want make the project a better place, and if the perception that I'm an ass is getting in the way of making the project a better place then I will happily step aside and let you run with it.

I have no interest in that.  This is about a bad tactic that had already failed in practice that you are insisting could somehow make things better.  I am pointing out the specific case of your own use of it with the purpose not of trying to punish or castigate you, but because you should be most familiar with your own experience.  [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Pregnancy&diff=450864933&oldid=450857877 This], for example, was an instance where you attempted to hat a conversation to \"keep it on topic\".  Note that you chose to retain your own comment while removing the disagreements; this may have seemed to you like a perfectly reasonable thing to do at the time, but I hope at this point you can see how bad an idea this really was, and where the results have gotten all of us.  If you wanted that to go away, all you needed to do was not reply-- or, in this case, take your edit summary and make it your actual edit.\n::::However, if we put the actual case aside and I provide my personal opinion, editing, hiding, or removing someone else's comments is inherently disrespectful of them and should, as such, be regarded as a punitive measure, or a measure of enforcement.  My own desire is that it not be done at all, but I recognize that there are cases when there may be legal issues involved for wikipedia, and other cases, like enforcing [[WP:NOTAFORUM]] when hiding comments is the only real solution.  More importantly, it is not to be taken up by someone who is involved in the discussion directly at all, and probably shouldn't be seen as something that those who have not sought and obtained additional priveleges from the community should take it upon themselves to do.\n::::You've not been modest in advertising your intelligence, and I bring that up not to start a fight but to suggest that I'm taking the radical step of being willing to believe you.  I wouldn't continue to argue if there was no point. [[User:Variable|siafu]] ([[User talk:Variable|talk]]) 00:18, 6 October 2011 (UTC)\n:::::Well, I'm glad to hear it's not personal (sorry for that suggestion, but it is something I have to be aware of: there are editors and admins who - for various reasons; some good, some bad - do take an extremely dim view of me.  But as I said already, the case on talk:pregnancy is a bad example, because I attempted it after the dispute had been going on for close to a month rather than early on in the discussion.  that's not a mistake I'm likely to make again.  You can keep raising that as a counter-example and I can keep telling you it's a bad example.  I believe we've looped through that three times already; I'm good for another four or five cycles, if you think that would be helpful.  {{=)|wink}}\n\n:::::As to the rest, we're just going to have to agree to disagree.  I will take it as read that you believe what you're saying, but I still cannot make sense of it.  You seem to have drawn the conclusion that editing out someone else's rude comment is somehow a far greater offense than them making the rude comment in the first place, which strikes me as perverse and perplexing.  It's like those cases I occasionally hear about where some burglar breaks into a home and gets jumped by the homeowner, and then later sues the homeowner for attacking him.  I am myself often self-righteous, so I understand the emotion, but I am rarely self-righteous about my ''bad'' behavior (that only happens when I'm in the heat of it, and I feel bad about it after).  Asserting in a cool and reasonable tone that one of the project's higher concerns is to preserve the individual's right to be a complete biatch at his\/her own discretion is incomprehensible to me.

On the contrary, I'm trying to point out that this particular \"solution\" (hatting) to the \"problem\" (off-topic or offensive commentary) does not work, and in fact makes things worse.  This is for 2 reasons: 1) the hatted users will, understandably, be quite angry about their comments being disregarded for reasons that are not likely to be obvious to them, and is likely to result in responses in situ (i.e., on the talk page where the hatting occurred) and escalate the dispute.  2) It is not reasonable to expect that involved editors will be able to dispassionately and reasonable use this tool.  In the cited example, you chose to remove two responses to your off-topic comment while leaving yours intact; as I said at the time in my edit summary, it looked an awful lot like an attempt to hold on to the last word.  Such abuses of this tool are not a personal flaw of yours, but a generally likely outcome when people invovled in a dispute believe that they have the right and responsibility to arbitrate what comments should and should not be visible in that dispute.  This, btw, is also the weak point of your burglary analogy: in a burglary, there is no question which of the two parties is at fault since there isn't a POV that would make breaking into someone else's house not against the law.  In an argument on wikipedia, there is usually no personally owned property or some other obvious flag that makes this unambiguous, especially for someone already wrapped up in one side of an argument (I did keep the caveat before of extreme cases; obviously if someone is hurling actual insults, racial slurs, &c. the distinction becomes clear; I still don't personally like removing such comments because I value the open and absolute record of an unredacted talk page, but I'm willing to accept it in service of following WP policy).  I also strongly disagree that doing it earlier on [[Talk:Pregnancy]] would have benefitted anything (would likely have been even worse, actually), but that's not entirely relevant to the question posed here on this page, so I'll leave it. [[User:Variable|siafu]] ([[User talk:Variable|talk]]) 15:40, 6 October 2011 (UTC)\n\n:::::::and again, I can only say that you are misunderstanding the concept.  with respect to your first two points:\n:::::::# '''''IF''''' this is established as a legitimate action, '''''THEN''''' few people will choose to escalate.  The only reason people escalate it now is out of a self-righteous belief that they have a right to use article talk to say whatever crappy thing comes into their head.  If this procedure were legitimized, they would not be able to maintain that self-righteous belief. They would then have to explain the value of particular comments on a case by case basis in order to have them restored. Only useful comments would be restored that way\n:::::::# I'm not counting on people using the tool perfectly; I'm counting on people using the tool ''collectively''.  In that case you pointed out (where I refactored an off-topic comment of yours), the problem was not with the hatting, it was with your subsequent action, here: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Pregnancy&diff=next&oldid=450864933].  What you ''did'' was move your comment ''out of the hat'' so it was visible again.  What you ''should have done'' was recognize that the action was correct but the implementation was wrong, and moved ''my'' comment ''into'' the hat. Had you expanded the hat to include what I said, I really would have had no grounds to object, it would have forestalled BC from subsequently removing the hat entirely, and it would have closed an irrelevant discussion completely.  Between the 2 or 3 we could have muddled through to a proper balance where sore points for all of us were removed from visibility; instead we went the other route and drew all the sore points back out into the light so we could bitch about them some more.\n:::::::'civil society' is not two words pushed together (a collection of independent individuals who are all supposed to be nice to each other - like that would ever work!).  Civil society is a collective structure that people exist within, something that establishes certain sacrifices everyone must make for their own (and everyone's) good.  Even in the real world, property is a collective structure rather than an individual one: you 'own' a house because the rules of the culture you live in give certain exclusive rights to you in exchange for certain behaviors on your part (stop paying your mortgage and see what 'ownership' really means).  On wikipedia the 'property' being broken into is the collective 'house' of civil discourse.  If I ask you to sacrifice the right to say something irrelevant and insensitive to me then I sacrifice that right myself, and there is no other way civil society works.  We simply need to establish the precedent that people should push the discussion towards civil respect rather than dragging it back towards interpersonal conflict, and then it will rapidly become self-regulating, like a good civil society should be.  --[[User_talk:Ludwigs2|<span style=\"color:darkblue;font-weight:bold\">Ludwigs<\/span><span style=\"color:green;font-weight:bold\">2<\/span>]] 16:31, 6 October 2011 (UTC)\n::::::::Since it's obvious both that the community is not supporting your request to legitimize this behavior, and that no amount of explaining from any number of users is going to lead you to any insight, it's clear that there is no point in continuing this discussion.

I deleted an attack article that was incorrectly tagged as A7, so I dropped a courtesy note on the tagger's talk page.  We got into a bit of a discussion, nothing heated or offensive (or so I thought).  However, the editor must have thought I was being offensive, as he stated as such in the discussion.  I apologised, and have read through what I wrote.  I am too close to the problem, as I cannot see how what I wrote could be seen as offensive.\n\nSo here I am, asking for your thoughts...\n\nThe thread is here: [[User talk:Chris the speller#Incorrect category for Michigan State Youth Soccer Association]].\n\n'''Important''': Please limit this thread to the discussion of '''my actions only''', not those of [[User:Chris the speller]].

The only spots that strike me as even potentially problematic are your request that the user read articles thoroughly (which could give the impression of \"I think you're not doing your job\") and your comment about it being ok if his tagging rate goes down (obviously said in good faith and not as \"yes, make you rate go down! please!\", but interpreted poorly by the other person). I guess the only thing you can do going forward to avoid this sort of thing is be aware that if you're telling someone you declined or changed their speedy, you are essentially telling them that they \"did it wrong,\" and you need to be careful to couch that telling in terms of \"here's something you might have missed, I know, I hate when I do that too\" and not \"I am coming down from on high to tell you you failed because...\"<p>All that said, however, to my eyes you certainly didn't put your foot in it on this one so much as you seem to have just run up against someone who was a tad defensive and upset.

(1P) You thanked the tagger for his nomination, you explained constructively what he did wrong in a way that he could learn from it, you were calm and collected throughout.

(3P) Finally, you noticed that something was wrong, and came here asking for more advice on how to improve, that was truly important. (1C) However, you could consider Googling \"praise to criticism ratio\". It's a common management concept. The problem is that people tend to notice criticism much more than praise, so if you want to be seen as balanced, you want to draw much more attention to praise proportionately.

I still stand by my statement that I don't promise to read ''any'' article thoroughly.

I saw the negative statement in it, but judged that to not be the primary intention of the article, and thought that A7 was a better fit than G10. Yes, I am still probably a little too sensitive and steamed about the accusation made in the section \"Hi there\" on my user talk page, but I think it's plain wrong to attack an editor who makes an improvement for not making more improvements.

Let's say you spotted an edit war, via RFPP, 3RRNB, or even just through randomly scouring articles, and you felt it was so bad and not clearly the fault of just one editor, such that full protection was the best option to stop the edit warring and get people to talk on the talk page.  Let's further say that this is the first time such a problem has occurred on this page, and so you used a limited duration protection. Discussion occurred, although no clear consensus had been reached, as the issues were quite complex.  After the protection expired, if one of the editors somehow got the idea that their version was, in fact, supported by consensus, even though consensus was not yet clear, what would you do?  Do you all believe in just throwing the protection back up (for longer or indefinitely), or has that one editor clearly been disruptive and thus a block is in order?  \n\nWhile I would like general opinions, if any admins want to look at the specific problem prompting this question, the article in question is [[Paragliding]] (though the enmity between editors is spilling out across a variety of other related articles as well, some of which are at AfD as possible OR\/SYNTH\/POV forks\/NOT violations).  This particular issue is a problem because there may have been off-wiki canvassing (I'm looking into that), most of the editors appear to be \"experts\" in the field, and apparently there's a lot of animosity between some of them based on things that have been happening outside of Wikipedia over the last several decades.  While I don't want to sound condescending to anyone's hobby, somehow I never thought that a sport\/hobby could engender as much animosity as a nationalist POV debate.  [[User:Qwyrxian|Qwyrxian]] ([[User talk:Qwyrxian|talk]]) 00:24, 11 October 2011 (UTC)\n\n:Simple.

This was in the wake of the [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration\/Sarah Palin protection wheel war|wheel war ArbCom case]] and various other insanity regarding the articles. There have been various flare-ups regarding the articles since - particularly when [[Bristol Palin]] appeared on ''[[Dancing With the Stars]]'' and during the aftermath of the [[2011 Tucson shooting]], but it always seemed in the context of a [[WP:BATTLEGROUND|political battleground]] between partisans for a \"President Sarah Palin\" and partisans of President Obama.\n\nI think things have '''finally''' settled down to the point to where we can lift the probation. A few weeks ago, an attack biography by [[Joe McGinniss]] about Palin was released, and there was surprisingly little battling over the article - issues were settled easily by talk page discussion. And a couple of days ago, Palin announced she will not be running for President against Obama, which should relieve the partisan pressure on both sides. I propose removing the community probation. [[User:Kelly|<span style=\"color:#060;font-family:Monotype Corsiva;cursor:help\">'''Kelly'''<\/span>]] <sup>[[User talk:Kelly|hi!]]<\/sup> 23:43, 7 October 2011 (UTC)\n\n:I endorse lifting the probation which has served its purpose. The probation is administered here: [[Talk:Sarah Palin\/Article probation]]. Except for one warning in September, the last warnings were issued in January 2011. The last two blocks were issued in April 2011 and December 2010. Now that Palin has decided to not run for US president, it is unlikely that she will be as polarizing a figure as she was at the time the probation was voted in by the community.  Keeping stale probations in place serves as a disincentive to editors who may legitimately fear getting blocked for engaging in a disagreement. It's time to bring this to a successful conclusion. Any future disruptions can be handled through ordinary procedures.  &nbsp; <b>[[User:Will Beback|<font color=\"#595454\">Will Beback<\/font>]]&nbsp; [[User talk:Will Beback|<font color=\"#C0C0C0\">talk<\/font>]]&nbsp; <\/b> 23:50, 7 October 2011 (UTC)\n::While I have no issues with the probation being lifted, it may perhaps be better if one were to lift the same a few days (perhaps ten days more?) from now, as the current news of her not running for the post may have died down [http:\/\/stats.grok.se\/en\/latest\/Sarah_Palin by then].[[User:Wifione|'''<span style=\"color: red;\">  Wifione<\/span>''']] [[User talk:Wifione|'''<sup>Message<\/sup>''']] 07:56, 8 October 2011 (UTC)\n:::Palin will always be in the news.

Any uninvolved admin could no longer topic ban an editor after only a single warning. That's a lower threshold than used with most ArbCom probations, where an enforcement would usually follow a structured discussion and consensus at AE. Lifting the probation would not undo the previous individual topic bans imposed by the ArbCom, the community, or admins under the probation.

Second, Rcsprinter123 is allowed to conduct one (1) GA review, which will be reviewed by a more experienced GA reviewer as well.  After that process is complete, the results can be reported here and the community can reconsider whether a ban on GA reviews is still warranted.  Further, in order to satisfy the concerns of some editors commenting here, I recommend that Rcsprinter123 review our copyright policies and seek out help if any of those issues seem unclear. [[User:Qwyrxian|Qwyrxian]] ([[User talk:Qwyrxian|talk]]) 03:25, 14 October 2011 (UTC)}}\n---- <!-- from Template:discussion top-->\n\nSince the 18<sup>th<\/sup> April 2011, I was given a topic ban [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User_talk:Rcsprinter123\/Archive_2#Community_topic_ban:_GA] from the [[WP:GA|good article]] process on Wikipedia for nominating and reviewing articles with little understanding of GA policies, and furthermore repeating them when I had been told not to do so. I was also blocked, [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User_talk:Rcsprinter123\/Archive_2#April_2011], for a week, as a harsh little reminder to abide by the rules; this block was ended early because I accepted mentorship from [[User:Worm That Turned]].  Since then I have been editing in almost every other area of the wiki, from article creation and deletion, from userboxes, through RfA and DYK. I also regularly help out at the [[WP:HD|help desk]], and do a regular vandalism patrol. So this shows that I can, and have, kept my nose out of GA for six months and avoided further blocking. I have been in a few scrapes since then, including a misunderstanding of AfD closures and copyright issues. \n\nI am here now to ask for a lifting of that GA topic ban. This does not mean that the second it is lifted I will run around crazily nominating or reviewing with no respect for any guidelines; I am just asking so that if, at anytime in the future, I feel any need to, for instance one of my articles I have created could be good enough to take a review. I have also spent the six months looking at the GA process, looking at nominations, reviews, the criteria, rules, policies, guidelines etc, and promise on my not-currently-blocked user account's life to abide by them.\n\nYou may also wish to review my contributions, and read the following links.

If so, what is his opinion of this request?

Worm takes the view that Rcsprinter has completed his mentorship so he's not technically Rcsprinter's mentor any more, although he's still happy to offer advice where necessary (and I think he intends to comment on this request in due course.) --[[User:Demiurge1000|Demiurge1000]] ([[User_talk:Demiurge1000|talk]]) 17:28, 7 October 2011 (UTC)\n:Sorry, I was trying to decide if I should comment here or move it to AN, since it's not really an incident. Anyway, comment here - Demiurge has correctly summed up my opinion, I \"released\" Rcsprinter back into the wild back in [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Rcsprinter123&diff=442090882&oldid=442089039 July], and I think it's commendable that he waited until now to put forward a request to have the topic ban lifted. He's come on a very long way since April (when he'd only been around a few months and made a couple of thousand edits) - to be a mature editor with over 11k edits under his belt. Yes, he made mistakes in the past and I'm sure he'll make them in the future, but I'd trust him to be able to good article reviews. I guess this request is largely to show the community has restored their trust him, and I'd like to see that happen. As such, I'd '''Support''' lifting the topic ban.

[[User:28bytes|28bytes]] ([[User talk:28bytes|talk]]) 18:03, 7 October 2011 (UTC)\n:::Indeed, it's part of 1(a) of the criteria. However, I am confident Rcsprinter does understand copyright policies - he just prioritizes them incorrectly. Demiurge1000 and I are working on encouraging him to remember that copyright is something that is essential to all parts of wikipedia, at all times, and even if an article needs improving, a copyvio is not the way to do it. It may not have been the best time to put this request up, based on those discussions and there's only one person who can tell you why he decided to put it up now. [[User:Worm That Turned|<span style=\"text-shadow:gray 3px 3px 2px;\"><font color=\"#000\">'''''Worm'''''<sup>TT<\/sup><\/font><\/span>]]&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&middot;<\/span>&#32;([[User Talk:Worm That Turned|talk]]) 18:10, 7 October 2011 (UTC)\n:Per 28bytes, I have concerns about the Copyright issues as well as his recent issues with non-Admin AfD closures (particularly related to his reasoning for closure as it would relate to his reasoning when undertaking a GA review) , at this time I'd '''support''' a relaxation allowing him to nominate his own articles but would '''opppose''' allowing him to nominate articles to which he isn't the primary contributor or undertaking reviews of GA candidates until such time as he has some at least some successful nominations of his own articles to show an understanding of the criteria. This seems to be in line with the reasons he wishes to have the ban lifted and would demonstrate good faith both by him, and in him. [[User:Stuart.Jamieson|Stuart.Jamieson]] ([[User talk:Stuart.Jamieson|talk]]) 18:27, 7 October 2011 (UTC)\n::I think this is a good compromise; allow nominations, and if that goes well, expand it to reviews. (The \"trial review\" idea below also seems like it's worth trying.) [[User:28bytes|28bytes]] ([[User talk:28bytes|talk]]) 19:08, 7 October 2011 (UTC)\n*I'm a little hesitant to support on a whim. Can we just [[WP:IAR|ignore]] the ban for a minute and have them perform one GA review to demonstrate their competency? If it's fine, I'll fully support and I'm sure everyone else will. If (worst case) they somehow screw up, I'll be happy to simply step in and complete the review for them (I've done so in the past), and decide whether to oppose from there. [[User talk:Swarm|<span style='color:black'><font face=\"helterskelter\">Swarm<\/font><\/span>]] 18:34, 7 October 2011 (UTC)\n*:I think Swarm's proposal is reasonable, support suspending the ban to allow one GA review, and reopen discussion upon completion.

Because the ban was imposed as a result of the community finding that Rcsprinter123 lacked the understanding of the GA process and criteria that is necessary to participate usefully in GA work, I think that a convincing demonstration how this has now changed would need to be part of any request to lift the ban. As no such demonstration is given here, I cannot support the request at this time. The proposal of allowing a trial review, above, seems reasonable. <small><span style=\"border:1px solid black;padding:1px;\">[[User:Sandstein|<font style=\"color:white;background:blue;font-family:sans-serif;\">'''&nbsp;Sandstein&nbsp;'''<\/font>]]<\/span><\/small> 18:43, 7 October 2011 (UTC)\n*The proposal to allow RCSprinter123 to nominate his own articles for GA should be allowed. As for reviewing others articles, the allowance of a one artice trial is reasonable, ''but'' another editor should also give a second opinion on the review. If this proves successful, then maybe a few more articles could be reviewed under the same conditions before a request to release this editor from the restriction can be allowed. [[User:Mjroots|Mjroots]] ([[User talk:Mjroots|talk]]) 19:05, 7 October 2011 (UTC)\n:I have reservations based on very recent issues brought up on Rcsprinter123's talkpage (for some reason spread through 3 different talkpage archives). I'm not convinced he fully understands the seriousness of copyright issues, purely because these problems have only been in the last week, and I'd like to see positive edits in that area over a longer period. I commend his recent work to clear up problems that have come to light. The AFD problems seem to indicate that he still maybe needs to slow down a little and listen a bit more when he does get into \"scrapes\". He doesn't always respond when legitimate issues are brought to his talkpage; indeed he has no obligation to, but communication is an important part of GA. I would completely oppose a lift of the ban on reviewing GAs at this time, unless there is compelling evidence that he is able to do so competently. I don't have a problem with him nominating articles at GA, and getting some articles through the GA process could be a good way for him to learn the ropes. --[[User:Belovedfreak|<span style=\"font-family: trebuchet\">Beloved<\/span>]][[User talk:Belovedfreak|<span style=\"font-family: trebuchet\">Freak<\/span>]] 19:09, 7 October 2011 (UTC)\n:<small>Note:Discussion has been moved from [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard\/Incidents]] to [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard]]. <font color=\"#00ACF4\">'''[[User:Rcsprinter123|<span style=\"font-family:cambria; font-size:11pt; color:gray\">Rcsprinter<\/span>]]''' [[User talk:Rcsprinter123|<span style=\"font-family:calibri; font-size:9pt; color:black\">(chatter)<\/span>]]<\/font> 09:26, 8 October 2011 (UTC)<\/small>\n\n* '''Support''' relaxing the ban for the duration of one review of another editor's nomination, so that we have something to assess when deciding how to proceed.

In 1915 it helped suppress the [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements#Singapore Mutiny 1915|mutiny of Sepoys in Singapore]]. The SSVF was officially formed in 1922, following the amalgamation of the Singapore Volunteer Corps, Penang and Province Wellesley Volunteer Corps, Malacca Volunteer Corps, and Labuan Volunteer Defence Detachment. In 1928, the SSVF infantry was re-organised into 4 battalions. The 1st and 2nd battalions consisted of members of the Singapore Volunteer Corps (1,250 men), the 3rd battalion consisted of the Penang & Province Wellesley Volunteer Corps (916 men) and the 4th Battalion consisted of the Malacca Volunteer Corps (675 men). Besides the infantry, the rest of the SSVF consisted of the Singapore Royal Artillery, Singapore Royal Engineers, Singapore Armoured Car Company and 3 ambulance units.\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Singapore Volunteer Force training November 1941.jpg|thumb|right|Volunteer troops training with a [[Lewis machine gun]], November 1941]]\nAs international tensions heightened during the 1930s, an increasing number of men of the various nationalities in the Settlements &mdash; predominantly [[Europe]]an, [[Malay people|Malay]], [[Chinese diaspora|Chinese]], [[British India|Indian]] and [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] &mdash; joined the SSVF. It included naval, air force, [[special operations]], [[irregular military forces|irregular units]] (such as [[Dalforce]]) and [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|home guard]] units. The SSVF &mdash; including four infantry [[battalion]]s &mdash; took part in the [[Battle of Singapore]] in 1942, and most of its members were captured on 15 February 1942 when their positions were overrun. The SSVF was reconstituted in 1948. In 1954, the Singapore Volunteer Corps was absorbed into the [[Singapore Armed Forces|Singapore Military Forces]] when the SSVF was disbanded.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Battle of Singapore]]\n*[[Battle of Malaya]]\n*[[SAF Volunteer Corps]](SAFVC)\n\n==References==\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin}}\n*Eternal Vigilance, the Price of Freedom; compiled by Foong Choon Hon, translated by Yuen Chen Ching; Asiapac Books, Singapore; 2006\n*Lee Geok Boi; The Syonan Years - Singapore under Japanese Rule 1942 - 1945; National Archives of Singapore; 2005\n{{refend}}\n\n[[Category:Military units and formations established in 1922]]\n[[Category:British colonial regiments]]\n[[Category:Military history of Singapore]]\n[[Category:Straits Settlements|Volunteer Force]]","timestamp":"20160410100035","user-timestamp":"20150410100035"},{"title":"Mehdi Niyayesh Pour","content":"{{Infobox football biography\n| name          = Mehdi Niyayesh Pour \n| image          = \n| fullname       = Mehdi Niyayesh Pour\n| height         = {{convert|1.79|m|ftin|abbr=on}}\n| birth_date    = {{Birth date and age|1992|1|25|df=y}}\n| birth_place = [[Ahvaz]], [[Iran]] \n| currentclub    = [[Esteghlal Ahvaz]]\n| clubnumber     = 28\n| position       = [[Forward (association football)#Striker|Striker]]\n| youthyears1    = 2008\u20132011 | youthclubs1    = [[Esteghlal Ahvaz]]\n| youthyears2    = 2011\u20132013 | youthclubs2    = [[Foolad]]\n| years1         = 2010\u20132011 | clubs1 = [[Esteghlal Ahvaz]] | caps1 = 9 | goals1 = 1\n| years2         = 2012\u20132015 | clubs2 = [[Foolad]] | caps2 = 1 | goals2 = 0\n| years3         = 2015      | clubs3 = [[Foolad Khuzestan B F.C.|Foolad B]] | caps3 = 10 | goals3 = 5\n| years4         = 2016\u2013     | clubs4 = [[Esteghlal Ahvaz]] | caps4 = 0 | goals4 = 0\n}}\n'''Mehdi Niyayesh Pour''' born 25 January 1992), is an Iranian [[Association football|footballer]], currently playing in [[Esteghlal Ahvaz]].

(Malcolm Elmore Walthall, The Walthall Family: A Genealogical History of the Descendants of William Walthall of Virginia, 1952, rev. 1963, p 7)\n\nIn the period before the [[American Civil War]], Port Walthall was a major shipping and passenger embarkation location, and was served by a [[railroad]]. During the War, the railroad tracks leading to the port were melted down to manufacture [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] cannon. The point where the tracks joined the [[Richmond and Petersburg Railroad]] some distance to the west was known as Port Walthall Junction.  \n\nThe [[Battle of Port Walthall Junction]] was fought on May 6&ndash;7, 1864, between [[Union army|Union]] and [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] forces during the [[American Civil War]]. Though initially successful, the Confederates were eventually defeated, allowing Union forces to cut the railroad, one of Richmond's vital supply lines.\n\nAfter the War, the railroad branch to Port Walthall was never restored, and Port Walthall came into disuse. In modern times, the name is memorialized by the Walthall exit of [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|Interstate 95]], VA-58.\n\n{{coord missing|Virginia}}\n\n[[Category:Geography of Chesterfield County, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Virginia in the American Civil War]]\n\n{{ChesterfieldVA-geo-stub}}","timestamp":"20160410100042","user-timestamp":"20150410100042"},{"title":"User talk:92.253.105.189","content":"== February 2012 ==\n[[File:Ambox warning pn.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Please stop your [[Wikipedia:Disruptive editing|disruptive editing]].

They have released six [[studio albums]], one [[compilation album]], as well as eight [[music single|singles]].\n\nNickel Creek's first widely known album, ''[[Nickel Creek (album)|Nickel Creek]]'', was released in 2001. It charted within the Top 20 of the ''Billboard'' [[Top Country Albums]] charts. The album featured three singles: \"[[When You Come Back Down]]\", \"[[The Lighthouse's Tale]]\", and \"Reasons Why\". The first two charted to number 48 and number 49 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, whereas the third single failed to chart. Also in 2001, the band were featured with [[Dolly Parton]] on \"[[Shine (Collective Soul song)|Shine]]\", a cover of the pop group [[Collective Soul]]'s signature song. The song was released as a single from Parton's album ''[[Little Sparrow]]'', and also featured a music video. ''Nickel Creek'' was then certified Gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] on February 4, 2004.\n\nIn 2003, they released their critically acclaimed album ''[[This Side]]''. It was success on the Top Country Albums chart, debuting and peaking at number 2, as well as their first album to chart within the Top 20 of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], where it reached number 18. It was also a number-one album on the ''Billboard'' [[Top Bluegrass Albums]] chart. The album only spawned one chart single with its [[This Side (song)|title track]]. It peaked at number 56 on the country charts.\n\nTheir fifth studio album, ''[[Why Should the Fire Die?]]'', was released in 2005. Like its predecessor, it too, made the Top 20 of the Billboard 200, but failed to enter the Top Country Albums chart. One single was released, \"When in Rome,\" but it failed to chart.\n\nThe band's sixth studio album, ''[[A Dotted Line]]'', was released April 1, 2014.<ref name=\"u-tsandiego\">Varga, George.

According to the book's title page, A Table Alphabetical was intended for \"Ladies, Gentlewomen, or any other unskillful persons\" so that \"they may the more easily and better understand many hard English words, which they shall hear or read in the Scriptures, Sermons, or else where, and also be made able to use them the same aptly themselves.\"\n\nThe first six entries in Cawdrey's Table show the simplicity and directness of his style:\n\n#'''Abandon''': cast away, or yeeld up, to leave or forsake.\n#'''Abash''': blush.\n#'''Abba''': father.\n#'''Abbess, abbatesse''': Mistress of a Nunnery, comforters of others.\n#'''abettors''': counselors.\n#'''aberration''': a going a stray, or wandering.\n\n=== Glossographia (1656) ===\n[[Thomas Blount (lexicographer)|Thomas Blount]]'s ''Glossographia, or, A dictionary interpreting all such hard words, of whatsoever language, now used in our refined English tongue'' (1656) was the fourth proper English dictionary and far larger than any preceding.<ref>Ian Mortimer, \u2018Blount, Thomas (1618\u20131679)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2008 [http:\/\/www.oxforddnb.com\/view\/article\/2697, accessed 26 April 2012]<\/ref>  It defined approximately 10,000 unusual words and was the first English dictionary to include etymologies (or word histories).

He was accordingly apprehended and brought to Delhi. On his pardon and release a contingent of royal troops under the command of Sheikh Bahauddin was sent with him to install him back and keep a watch. Sheikh Bahauddin was accompanied by his wife and his younger brother Sheikh Nizamuddin.\n\nWhile there in Majhauli they often used to cross over to the other side of the river [[Ghagra River|Ghagra]] for hunting, which was ruled by another [[Rajbar|Raja Rajbar]] with his capital at [[Chohangarh]]. The Raja kidnapped the daughter of his [[Diwan (title)|Diwan]] (Chief Advisor). Help was sought from Sheikh Bahauddin and, in the ensuing battle, the Raja was defeated and killed and the girl restored to her family. The Raja's estate of 52 villages was also confiscated and awarded to Sheikh Bahauddin, half of which he gave to his younger brother. The descendants of these two brothers are now settled in these villages with the family name of Ansaris.\n\nThe [[Siddiqui|Siddiqui's]] branch of Anwayan originally came from Siddiquis of [[Harihans]] Dist. Sewan, Bihar when [[Sheikh Tabarak Hussain]] married the only daughter of Sheikh Chiragh Ali of Anwayan and settled down there. She had full or partial share in about eight villages around. Sheikh Tabarak Hussain was a great organizer and administrator. He reorganized the cultivation policy and revenue system, attracted craftsmen, service providers and farm labor to settle on the land to make it a self-contained village. He got the land registered as \"Waqw-al-Awlad\" which meant joint ownership by the family to protect against bifurcation and individual sale etc. He reserved a portion of the land as \"[[Waqf]]\" for the village Mosque, [[Eidgah]], Grave Yard and also gave away land for the village primary school and for a middle school in the market place. He organized a quick justice system for his tenants and the hall reserved for this purpose is still called \"[[Kutchehri]]\".\n\nHe died in 1899 at the age of 63 and his second son Shahid Hussain took over the affairs with formal \"Dastar-Bandi\" Ceremony in accordance with family traditions. The Family of Anwayan got an early start in western education by sending (Barrister) Mohammad Sami for his bar-at-law to England as early as in 1910. He returned in 1914 (on completion of his studies just before the beginning of the 1st World War) with an English wife. He had hardly settled down in his professional practice in [[Banaras Colony|Banaras]] when he died in 1918. He had three sisters, the eldest was married to Sheikh Shahid Hussain, the next to Sheikh Abid Hussain and the youngest one to Sheikh Nizamuddin of Hari Hans. Barrister Sami's widow along with her children shifted to Anwayan and then went back to England with them. Nothing is known about the family now specially after 1935. This was all a great set back to the family. The family was steered back to western education with the initiative of Sheikh Abid Hussain, when he sent Nasir Hussain Siddiqui to Muslim university of Aligarh in 1934. With the present disposition the family now is dispersed over many continents\/countries like Australia, United States of America, Canada, England, Gulf States, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, England etc..\n\nTHE ABOVE WRITE UP RELATES ONLY TO SIDDIQUIS OF ANWAYAN WHO TRACE THEIR ANCESTORY TO SHEIKH TABARAK HUSSAIN WHO MIGRATED FROM HARIHANS AND SETTLED DOWN AT ANWAYAN AFTER MARRYING THE ONLY DAUGHTER OF SHEIKH CHIRAGH ALI. The history of ancestors of Sheikh Tabarak Hussain  (and including  his descendants in Anwayan) has been ably chronicled  by Ch. Shaikh Mohd.Zaki Siddiqui Saheb (1874-1946) in his well researched book entitled \"TAREEKH - UL- HARIHANS WITH KHANDANI SHIJRA\". This work has further been  updated by his able son, Mr.  Mashkoor Ahmad Siddiqui who currently lives with his son Dr. Jamshed Siddiqui in New Delhi  after retiring from the service of Indian Railways.\n\nGM Siddiqui (last paragraph added by Javed Nasir, son of late Mr. Nasir Hussain Siddiqui S\/O Late Shaikh Abid Hussain)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Villages in Ballia district]]","timestamp":"20160410100058","user-timestamp":"20150410100058"},{"title":"Category:Lists of mayors of places in the United States","content":"[[Category:Mayors of places in the United States| ]]\n[[Category:Lists of mayors|United States]]\n[[Category:Lists of people by city in the United States| Mayors]]\n[[Category:Lists of political office-holders in the United States|Mayors]]","timestamp":"20160410100058","user-timestamp":"20150410100058"},{"title":"User talk:131.211.234.34","content":"\n== September 2011 ==\n\n[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia!

They had originally been intended for [[Operation Sea Lion|Operation ''Sea Lion'']] (''Seel\u00f6we''), the planned German invasion of England. Of these four tank battalions, two formed the 18th Panzer Regiment and the other two the 28th Panzer Regiment of the 18th Panzer Division. In March 1941 the 18th Panzer Division was reorganized, the 28th Panzer Regiment was disbanded, one of its battalions became the third battalion of the 18th Panzer Regiment, the other battalion was transferred to the [[3rd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|3rd Panzer Division]].\n\n'''Organization'''\n18th Panzer Division:\n*''Panzer-Regiment'' 18; [[File:Panzer III in Russia 1941.jpg|thumb|An 18th PzDiv [[Panzerkampfwagen III|Panzer III]] in 1941]]\n*''Pz.Gr.Rgt'' 52; \n*''Pz.Gr.Rgt'' 101;\n*''Artillerie-Regiment'' 88;\n*''Pz.

The 18th Panzer Division fought as part of [[XLVII Panzer Corps (Germany)|XLVII Panzer Corps]], and over the next six months was involved in seizing [[Smolensk]], [[Bryansk]] and the assault on [[Tula, Russia|Tula]]. However, like the rest of the German Army the 18th Panzer Division was unprepared for the winter and was driven back to [[Oryol]] in January 1942 with heavy losses.\n\nIn the summer of 1942, the 18th Panzer Division took part in the initial drive on [[Stalingrad]], but was transferred to the central section of the front. The 18th Panzer Division took part in defensive battles around [[Oryol]] in 1942-43, and in anti-partisan operations in the spring of 1943. In the summer of 1943 the 18th Panzer Division fought in the [[Battle of Kursk]], and suffered heavy losses. After Kursk the 18th Panzer-Division was disbanded and the division's personnel were used to build the [[18th Artillery Division (Germany)|18th Artillery Division]].\n\n== Commanding officers ==\n*''[[General der Panzertruppe]]n'' [[Walther Nehring]], 26 October 1940\n*''[[Generalleutnant]]'' [[Karl Freiherr von Th\u00fcngen]], 26 January 1942\n*''[[General der Nachrichtentruppe]]n'' [[Albert Praun]], July 1942\n*''Generalleutnant'' Karl Freiherr von Th\u00fcngen, 24 August 1942\n*''Generalleutnant'' [[Erwin Menny]], 15 September 1942\n*''Generalleutnant'' Karl Freiherr von Th\u00fcngen, February 1943\n*''Generalleutnant'' [[Karl-Wilhelm von Schlieben]], 1 April 1943\n\n== References ==\n* Rosado, J. and Bishop, C.

Early in 1915 he was appointed director of the [[Sydney Conservatorium of Music|New South Wales State Conservatorium]] at a salary of \u00a31,250 a year.\n\nVerbrugghen arrived in [[Sydney]] in the same year full of enthusiasm. He had a great admiration for English-speaking people but did not like the methods of their schools of music, and decided that the conservatorium at Sydney should be based on continental models. He got together a remarkably fine orchestra, including the other members of his excellent string quartet who had come with him. For six years Verbrugghen's influence on the musical life of Sydney was of outstanding importance, but the politicians had not realized that it is impossible to carry on work of this nature without financial loss. The orchestra was disbanded in 1921 and Verbrugghen, who had suffered much from worry, went to America for health reasons.\n\nIn 1922 he was a guest conductor of the [[Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra]], and had such a brilliant success that he was given the position of permanent conductor. Efforts were made in Australia to persuade him to return without success. In 1928, he was elected a national honorary member of [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia Fraternity]], the American fraternity for men in music. In 1931 he collapsed at a rehearsal of his orchestra, and never completely recovered his health. From September 1933 he was chairman of the Department of Music at [[Carleton College]], [[Northfield, Minnesota|Northfield]], [[Minnesota]], and he died in 1934.\n\nThere is a Verbrugghen Street in the suburb of [[Melba, Australian Capital Territory|Melba]] in the Australian national capital, [[Canberra]].  All the streets in the suburb are named after significant figures in Australian music. Verbrugghen Hall at the [[Sydney Conservatorium of Music]] in Sydney also commemorates his name.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Dictionary of Australian Biography|First=Henri|Last=Verbrugghen|Link=http:\/\/gutenberg.net.au\/dictbiog\/0-dict-biogT-V.html#verbrugghen1}}\n\n{{Minnesota Orchestra conductors}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2010}}\n{{Authority control}}\n \n{{DEFAULTSORT:Verbrugghen}}\n[[Category:Belgian conductors (music)]]\n[[Category:Belgian classical violinists]]\n[[Category:Sydney Conservatorium of Music faculty]]\n[[Category:1873 births]]\n[[Category:1934 deaths]]","timestamp":"20160410100114","user-timestamp":"20150410100114"},{"title":"User talk:66.227.254.249","content":"[[Image:Information.svg|25px]] [[Wikipedia:Introduction|Welcome]] to Wikipedia, and thank you for [[Special:Contributions\/66.227.254.249|your contributions]], including your edits to [[:WXYT-FM]].

He was nicknamed \"El Sapo\" (\"The Toad\") for his typical posture in the goal mouth. From 1938\u201359 he played primarily for [[Club Deportivo Universidad Cat\u00f3lica|CD Universidad Cat\u00f3lica]] in Santiago. With [[Chilean national football team|Chile]] he took part in seven [[Copa Am\u00e9rica|South American Championship]]s and one World Cup.\n\n==Career==\nSerjio (later Sergio) Livingstone's family hailed from [[Scotland]]. His father John, who played for [[Santiago National|Santiago National FC]], was a pioneer of the game in Chile. Livingstone originally joined [[Uni\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola]]. He abandoned football to study law at the [[Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile]]. Soon he acquainted himself with the university's football team, and from 1938 he began to establish himself as the goalkeeper of [[Club Deportivo Universidad Cat\u00f3lica|CD Universidad Cat\u00f3lica]].\n[[File:Sergio Livingstone - Racing - 1943.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Livingstone wearing his Racing Club jersey]]\nHe debuted in the [[Chilean national football team|national team]] at the [[1941 South American Championship]] which took place in Chile, winning 5\u20130 against [[Ecuador]]. By the end of the tournament Chile ended third, and Livingstone was considered the best player of the tournament. Altogether, Livingstone played between 1941 and 1954 in 52 matches for Chile,<ref>Roberto Mamrud. [http:\/\/www.rsssf.com\/miscellaneous\/chil-recintlp.html Chilean Record International Players] 19 February 2010, RSSSF<\/ref> which made him the country's record international until 1962, participating in five more South American Championships, totaling 34 matches in this competition, which remains record. He also took part in the [[FIFA World Cup 1950|World Cup 1950]] in Brazil, where Chile exited after the first group phase. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nAt club level he spent 1943 in Argentina playing 30 matches for [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing Club]]. He cut short his time in [[Argentina]] for sentimental reasons and rejoined Cat\u00f3lica in 1944, winning the national championships of 1949 and 1954. After the second title the club had the misfortune to be relegated in the season immediately thereafter, but managed to return to the first division as quickly. After a brief spell on loan in 1957 with [[CSD Colo-Colo]] he once more returned to Cat\u00f3lica where he finished his career in 1959.\nFollowing his football career, he became a well-known sports journalist and television personality with [[Televisi\u00f3n Nacional de Chile|TVN]], where he remained until his death(more than 60 years).  {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 2009, a [http:\/\/www.lanacion.cl\/prontus_noticias_v2\/site\/artic\/20090416\/pags\/20090416220023.html street] in the district of [[Independencia, Chile|Independencia]] in Santiago was named for Livingstone.\n\n==Titles==\n*[[Primera Divisi\u00f3n de Chile|National Championship]]: 1949, 1954 for the Universidad Cat\u00f3lica\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http:\/\/www.fifa.com\/worldfootball\/statisticsandrecords\/players\/player=53111\/index.html Sergio Livingstone profile at FIFA]\n* Claudio Pizarro: [http:\/\/www.theclinic.cl\/2009\/09\/18\/sergio-%E2%80%9Csapo%E2%80%9D-livingstone-un-crack-de-89-anos-%E2%80%9Csi-jugara-ahora-seria-farandulero%E2%80%9D \"Sergio 'Sapo' Livingstone, un crack de 89 a\u00f1os: \"Si jugara ahora, ser\u00eda farandulero\"], 18 September 2009, ''The Clinic''\n* Jorge Guerrero Cort\u00e9s: ''[http:\/\/jorgeguerreroc.wordpress.com\/2010\/06\/04\/sergio-livingstone\/ El libro no escrito de Sergio Livingstone]'' 4 June 2010, DOREMIFAGOL\n\n{{Chile Squad 1950 World Cup}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Livingstone, Sergio}}\n[[Category:1920 births]]\n[[Category:2012 deaths]]\n[[Category:Chilean expatriate footballers]]\n[[Category:Chile international footballers]]\n[[Category:Campeonato Nacional (Chile) players]]\n[[Category:Club Deportivo Universidad Cat\u00f3lica footballers]]\n[[Category:Colo-Colo players]]\n[[Category:Racing Club de Avellaneda footballers]]\n[[Category:Expatriate footballers in Argentina]]\n[[Category:Chilean people of Scottish descent]]\n[[Category:Chilean television presenters]]\n[[Category:1950 FIFA World Cup players]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Santiago]]\n[[Category:Sports journalists]]\n[[Category:Disease-related deaths in Chile]]\n[[Category:Chilean people of Austrian descent]]","timestamp":"20160410100121","user-timestamp":"20150410100121"},{"title":"Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team\/River articles by quality\/17","content":"{{User:WP 1.0 bot\/Historical|type=byquality}}","timestamp":"20160410100121","user-timestamp":"20150410100121"},{"title":"Slavko \u0160tancer","content":"{{one source|date=March 2015}}\n'''Slavko \u0160tancer''' (26 July 1872 \u2013 16 June 1945) was the [[commander-in-chief]] and [[inspector-general]] of \"[[Army of the Independent State of Croatia|Domobranstvo]]\" (or Domobrani), the regular army of the [[Independent State of Croatia]] during the [[Second World War]].

The spaceship begins to experience power losses, and Snowcap personnel begin arrangements to abort its mission.\n\nBack on the base, the Doctor reveals what he knows about the [[tenth planet]]: it is [[Mondas]], Earth's former sister planet and its inhabitants will soon be visiting Earth.  True to his prediction, three robotic creatures land outside, killing the guards and disguising themselves in the dead men's furs to gain access.\n\nWhile everyone is distracted by their efforts to land ''Zeus IV'' safely, the creatures are easily able to take over the base. The base personnel and Polly plead with the invaders to allow them to save the lives of the ''Zeus IV'' crew, but the creatures say that their lives are irrelevant to them. They explain that they are [[Cyberman|Cybermen]], who were once like human beings, but gradually replaced their bodies with mechanical parts, including eliminating the \"weakness\" of [[emotion]] from their [[brain]]s.  The Cybermen allow the men to make contact with ''Zeus IV'', but it is too late as the ship is dragged away by Mondas and explodes.\n\nThe Cybermen explain that Mondas is absorbing energy from Earth and will soon destroy it.  They propose to take humans back to Mondas and turn them into Cybermen.\n\nBen, who has been imprisoned in the projection room after attempting to kill a Cyberman, rigs up the projector to blind incoming Cybermen, allowing him to steal his guard's weapon and kill him.  Sneaking back into the Tracking Room, he hands the cyberweapon to General Cutler, the base commander, who kills the remaining two Cybermen.  Cutler contacts Space Command HQ in [[Geneva]] and is informed that they have sent his son on a mission to rescue the doomed ''Zeus IV''.\n\nCutler decides it is time to take the fight to the Cybermen and decides to use the powerful Z-bomb to destroy Mondas. Ben argues against using the bomb, saying that Mondas might destroy itself anyway when it absorbs too much energy. The chief scientist at Snowcap, Dr. Barclay, is also concerned, saying that the [[radioactive contamination|radiation]] caused by the exploding planet would cause great loss of life on Earth.  Unswayed, Cutler orders Ben to be imprisoned in a cabin with the Doctor, who is unconscious and seemingly ill.\n\nBarclay goes to Ben and tells him how to sabotage the rocket to prevent it from reaching Mondas, but Cutler notices Barclay's absence and catches Ben in the act. Cutler attempts to fire the Z-bomb, but the engines fail on the launchpad thanks to Ben's sabotage. Cutler, enraged, threatens to kill Ben, Barclay, and the Doctor, who has now regained consciousness.  Before he can shoot the Doctor, Cutler is killed by the leader of a newly arrived squad of Cybermen.\n\nThe Cybermen insist that the rocket pointed at Mondas be dismantled.  The Doctor suggests that it would be a good idea to go along with this, and tells the others to play for time, as Mondas cannot take much more energy now.  The Cybermen take Polly back to their spaceship as a hostage.\n\nAs the Cybermen take over Space Command in Geneva, the Doctor realises that their plan is to destroy the Earth with the Z-bombs, thus saving Mondas.  He manages to communicate this revelation to Ben and the others over the intercom before the Cybermen take him prisoner.  In the radiation room, Ben surmises that the reason why they need to use humans to do this work rather than doing it themselves is that they are highly susceptible to radiation.  Barclay suggests using the rods from the reactor chamber as a portable weapon against the Cybermen.  This proves successful, allowing Ben, Barclay, and the others to regain control of the base.  More Cybermen enter the Tracking Room, but just at that moment Mondas explodes, disabling all the remaining Cybermen.\n\n[[File:Tenth Planet 2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Doctor regenerates for the first time.]]\n\nCutler's son contacts the base from ''Zeus IV'', telling them that his ship is now back to full power and Geneva tells Barclay that the Cyberman threat has ended. Meanwhile, Ben makes his way back to the Cybermen's ship to rescue the Doctor and Polly. The Doctor seems to deliberate as to whether \"it's all over\" before settling that it's \"far from over\" before making his way back to the TARDIS. As Ben and Polly hammer on the door, the controls operate of their own accord and the central column begins to rise and fall.  The Doctor seizes enough energy to open the door and Ben and Polly finally get in. Barely conscious, the Doctor collapses to the floor, and before the astonished eyes of his companions, he becomes enveloped in a bright light. After the light dies down, the Doctor`s face is different and has the appearance of a [[Second Doctor|younger man]].\n\n===Continuity===\nThe events leading up to this story, from the Cybermen's perspective, are heard in the [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] audio story ''[[Spare Parts (Doctor Who)|Spare Parts]]'' with the [[Fifth Doctor]] and [[Nyssa (Doctor Who)|Nyssa]]. The story deals with many aspects left unexplained in this story; such as how Mondas left the solar system and returned again. The [[Sixth Doctor]] serial, ''[[Attack of the Cybermen]]'', takes place in 1985, a year before the events of ''The Tenth Planet''. In that serial the Cybermen attempt to alter history so Mondas is not destroyed.\n\nWhile the Doctor [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerates]] at the end of this story, the process is unnamed. In the subsequent serial, ''[[The Power of the Daleks]]'', the Doctor states that he has been \"renewed\", implying a restoration of youth rather than a change of body. The concept was not called \"regeneration\" until ''[[Planet of the Spiders]]''. Script editor Gerry Davis later stated that it was intended for the energy drain from Mondas to be the cause of the regeneration, but that it did not come across clearly on screen.\n\n==Production==\nAll four episodes of this story feature a specially designed graphics sequence used for the opening titles and closing credits. Designed by Bernard Lodge, they were intended to resemble a computer printout.<ref>http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/doctorwho\/classic\/episodeguide\/tenthplanet\/detail.shtml<\/ref> In the opening credits for the first episode, Kit Pedler is incorrectly identified as \"Kitt Pedler\". In the opening credits for the third episode, Gerry Davis is incorrectly identified as \"Gerry Davies.\"\n\nWilliam Hartnell did not appear in the third episode.<ref>http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/doctorwho\/classic\/episodeguide\/tenthplanet\/detail.shtml<\/ref> On the Monday before the programme was due to be recorded, he sent a telegram to the production team informing them that he was too ill to work. Gerry Davis rewrote the script to explain the Doctor's absence (his sudden collapse) and gave his dialogue to other characters, most noticeably Ben. This was not as much of an interruption to the episode's production as it would seem, as all four episodes had been written so that Hartnell would have relatively little to do in case of just such an event.\nThe original draft of episode 4 did not feature the Doctor regenerating at the end.<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.doctorwhonews.net\/2013\/09\/original-tenth-planet-script-found.html |title=Original Tenth Planet Script Found |publisher=Doctor Who News |date=2013-01-09 |accessdate=2013-10-09}}<\/ref>\n\nThe First Doctor's last words were originally scripted as something similar to \"No... no, I simply will not give in!\" Time was running short towards the end of production, and director [[Derek Martinus]] opted not to record the line, wanting to ensure that the regeneration sequence was recorded as well as possible. As a result, the First Doctor's last words were simply \"Ah! Yes. Thank you. That's good, keep warm.\"\n\n===Cast notes===\n\nPatrick Troughton appears in the final episode, uncredited, as the Second Doctor. William Hartnell would reprise the role of the First Doctor on only one occasion: the tenth anniversary serial ''[[The Three Doctors (Doctor Who)|The Three Doctors]]'', although a photograph of him would be seen briefly as Troughton first looks into a mirror at the start of Troughton's first serial, ''[[The Power of the Daleks]]''; the first episode begins with a shot of Troughton lying on the TARDIS floor. A clip of Hartnell from part 6 of ''[[The Dalek Invasion of Earth]]'' was used at the beginning of the 20th anniversary special, ''[[The Five Doctors]]'' (where [[Richard Hurndall]] would play the First Doctor during most of the episode). A clip of Hartnell from ''The Tenth Planet'' was used in ''[[Earthshock]]'', when the Cybermen review the Doctor's change of appearance.\n\n===Missing episode===\nThe last episode of this serial is [[Doctor Who missing episodes|missing]]. It is possibly the most sought-after of the missing episodes, because it contains the historic first regeneration scene (even though a low-quality, truncated copy of this sequence survives and is held in the BBC Archives), and also because it is William Hartnell's final episode. In fact, it is included in a list of the ten most wanted missing programmes{{citation needed|reason=Where is a list of 10 most wanted missing programmes?|date=June 2015}} alongside the BBC studio footage from the [[Apollo 11]] landings (which is currently held only in soundtrack form).\n\nPopular myth has it that the only surviving [[telerecording]] copy of the fourth episode was lost when loaned out to the children's programme ''[[Blue Peter]]'' in 1973 when they wished to use a clip from it in a feature on the tenth anniversary of ''Doctor Who''.<ref>http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/doctorwho\/classic\/episodeguide\/tenthplanet\/detail.shtml<\/ref> Although a print of ''[[The Daleks' Master Plan]]'' Episode 4 (\"The Traitors\") was loaned to ''Blue Peter'' and not returned to the BBC Film Library, there was never a copy of ''The Tenth Planet'' Episode 4 there to have been loaned. Another department &ndash; [[BBC Worldwide|BBC Enterprises]] &ndash; was still offering all four episodes for sale to foreign broadcasters until the end of the following year and would not, in any case, have loaned out master negatives.\n\nIn 1992, a man named Roger K. Barrett (later revealed to be an alias; it being based on the real name of [[Syd Barrett]]) claimed to have a videotape recording of Episode 4 of this story, and offered to sell it to the BBC for \u00a3500. Before this was revealed as a hoax, the BBC produced a special introduction for an intended VHS release of the story, hosted by [[Michael Craze]], two versions of which were filmed: one explaining that Episode 4 was still missing, the other introducing the story as if it were complete.  A documentary called \"Missing in Action\", made in 1993 and narrated by Nicholas Courtney, also mentions the hoax.\n\nFor the 2013 DVD release, episode four was animated by Planet 55 Studios.<ref>http:\/\/planet55studios.com.au\/doctor-who-the-tenth-planet\/<\/ref>\n\n==Broadcast and reception==\n{{Doctor Who episode head\n|Archive=Y\n|\n{{Doctor Who episode body|Episode 1|{{Start date|1966|10|8|df=y}}|23:08|5.5|16mm t\/r|Archive=y}}<!--29-->\n{{Doctor Who episode body|Episode 2|{{Start date|1966|10|15|df=y}}|23:15|6.4|16mm t\/r|Archive=y}}<!--29-->\n{{Doctor Who episode body|Episode 3|{{Start date|1966|10|22|df=y}}|23:31|7.6|16mm t\/r|Archive=y}}<!--29-->\n{{Doctor Who episode body|Episode 4|{{Start date|1966|10|29|df=y}}|24:02|7.5|Archive=y|Fragment=y}}<!--29-->\n|<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url= http:\/\/gallifreyone.com\/episode.php?id=dd\n|title= The Tenth Planet\n|publisher = Outpost Gallifrey\n|author = Shaun Lyon|date = 2007-03-31\n|accessdate = 2008-08-30\n|archiveurl = http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20080331033327\/http:\/\/www.gallifreyone.com\/episode.php?id=dd <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-03-31|display-authors=etal}}\n<\/ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n|url= http:\/\/www.drwhoguide.com\/who_2d.htm\n|title= The Tenth Planet\n|publisher = Doctor Who Reference Guide\n|date =\n|accessdate = 2008-08-30\n}}\n<\/ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n|url= http:\/\/www.shannonsullivan.com\/drwho\/serials\/dd.html\n|title= The Tenth Planet\n|publisher = A Brief History of Time Travel\n|last = Sullivan\n|first = Shannon\n|date = 2006-05-10\n|accessdate = 2008-08-30\n}}\n<\/ref>\n}}\nIn 2009, Patrick Mulkern of ''[[Radio Times]]'' found the original Cybermen design like \"usherettes from some kinky, futuristic moviehouse\", but praised the character of Cutler and Hartnell's Doctor.<ref>{{cite web|first=Patrick|last=Mulkern|url= http:\/\/www.radiotimes.com\/blog\/2009-04-14\/doctor-who-the-tenth-planet|title=Doctor Who: The Tenth Planet|work=[[Radio Times]]|date=14 April 2009|accessdate=9 February 2013}}<\/ref> Den of Geek named the cliffhanger of Episode 4 as one of the programme's ten \"classic\" cliffhangers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.denofgeek.us\/tv\/doctor-who\/20847\/10-classic-doctor-who-cliffhangers|title=10 classic Doctor Who cliffhangers|publisher=Den of Geek|date=2 June 2011|accessdate=9 February 2013}}<\/ref> Alasdair Wilkins of [[io9]] described it as \"a very solid, at times excellent story\" and noted \"The Cybermen have possibly been more intimidating in other stories, but they have never been creepier than they are here\".

It was the first Hartnell-era serial novelisation to be commissioned by Target, and the first new adaptation of a Hartnell adventure to be published in nearly ten years.\n\nThe novelisation largely follows the original script and so places the action in the year 2000 as well as restoring the Doctor to the third episode. Also, in the first scene in which the Doctor, Ben and Polly appear (in the TARDIS), the Doctor is beginning to show signs of his failing health; sometimes mistakenly addressing Ben and Polly as \"[[Ian Chesterton|Ian]]\" and \"[[Barbara Wright (Doctor Who)|Barbara]]\", thereby revealing signs that all is not as it should be. Also, the regeneration of the Doctor occurs in the TARDIS differently. The Doctor uses what appears to be a rejuvenation chamber that assists him in his regeneration.\n\n===Home media===\nThe story was released on [[VHS]] in the UK in 2000 from BBC Video, with the fourth episode reconstructed by the [[Doctor Who Restoration Team]] using still photos, existing clips and the surviving audio soundtrack. This release was a double-tape set entitled \"Doctor Who: The Cybermen Box Set: The Tenth Planet and [[Attack of the Cybermen]]\". In the U.S. and Canada both stories were released individually in 2001. The existing clips from the missing final episode \u2013 8&nbsp;mm film recordings made by fans and a 16mm film clip of the regeneration (from a 1973 edition of Blue Peter) \u2013 were included in the [[DVD]] release ''[[Lost in Time (Doctor Who)|Lost in Time]]'' in 2004. The only surviving clip of the regeneration was also released as a special feature on the DVD releases for ''[[The Three Doctors (Doctor Who)|The Three Doctors]]'' and ''[[Castrovalva (Doctor Who)|Castrovalva]]''.\n\nThe story was released on DVD on 14 October 2013,<ref>{{cite web |url=http:\/\/www.bbcshop.com\/doctor-who\/doctor-who-the-tenth-planet-dvd\/invt\/bbcdvd3382 |title=Doctor Who: The Tenth Planet (DVD) |accessdate=15 October 2013 }}<\/ref> with the missing fourth episode animated<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.doctorwho.tv\/whats-new\/article\/classic-doctor-who-to-be-animated-for-dvd-release|accessdate=22 August 2013|title=CLASSIC DOCTOR WHO TO BE ANIMATED FOR DVD RELEASE|publisher=http:\/\/www.doctorwho.tv}}<\/ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.doctorwhonews.net\/2013\/02\/australian-fans-preview-animated-tenth.html|accessdate=22 August 2013|title=australian fans preview animated the tenth planet|publisher=http:\/\/www.doctorwhonews.net\/}}<\/ref> along with additional extra features including the original reconstruction of episode four from the 2000 VHS Release included as an extra and a special \"Frozen Out\" documentary on the making of the story.\n\nThe \"Regenerations\" box set, released on 24 June 2013,<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/gp\/product\/B00BWU1ESO\/ref=ox_sc_sfl_title_4?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE|title=Regenerations|publisher=http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/}}<\/ref> contains ''The Tenth Planet'' (including the newly animated fourth episode).

Paving materials include [[Asphalt concrete|asphalt]], [[concrete]], stone such as [[flagstone]], [[cobblestone]], and [[Sett (paving)|setts]], [[artificial stone]], [[brick]]s, [[tile]]s, and sometimes wood. In [[landscape architecture]] pavements are part of the [[hardscape]] and are used on [[sidewalk]]s, [[road surface]]s, [[patio]]s, [[courtyard]]s, etc.\n\n''Pavement'' comes from Latin ''pavimentum'' meaning a floor beaten or rammed down, through Old French ''pavement''.<ref>[http:\/\/triggs.djvu.org\/century-dictionary.com\/djvu2jpgframes.php?volno=05&page=779&query=pavement \"Pavement\", ''The Century Dictionary'']<\/ref> The meaning of a beaten down floor was obsolete before the word became English.<ref>\"pavement, n.\" ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) \u00a9 Oxford University Press 2009<\/ref>\n\nPavement laid in patterns such as [[mosaics]] were commonly used by the Romans.\n\n==Paver==\n[[Image:Paver Blocks Exterior Circular 3008px.jpg|thumb|right|Concrete paver blocks laid in a circular pattern]]\n[[Image:PaverPatio.jpg|thumb|right|Concrete paver blocks in a rectangular pattern]]\nA '''paver''' is a paving stone, tile,<ref>\"paver\" def. 2.

In a factory, concrete pavers are made by pouring a mixture of concrete and some type of coloring agent into a mold of some shape and allowing to set. They are applied by pouring a standard concrete foundation, spreading sand on top, and then laying the pavers in the desired pattern. No actual [[adhesive]] or retaining method is used other than the weight of the paver itself except edging. Pavers can be used to make roads, driveways, patios, walkways and other outdoor platforms.\n\n===Interlocking concrete pavers===\n[[File:Paving stone driveway.jpg|thumb|Interlocking Concrete Paver Driveway]]\nAn '''interlocking concrete paver''' is a type of paver.  This special type of paver, also known as a '''segmental paver''', has emerged over the last couple of decades in the [[United States]] as a very popular alternative to [[brick]], [[clay]] or [[concrete]].<ref name=\"ICPI\">http:\/\/www.icpi.org\/theindustry<\/ref>\n\nSegmental pavers have been used for thousands of years.

But it was not until the mid-1940s that pavers began to be produced out of concrete.  It started in the [[Netherlands]]<ref name=\"ICPI\" \/><ref name=\"Pacific paving stone\" \/> where all the roads are made to be flexible because the country is below sea level and the ground shifts, moves and sinks. Poured [[concrete]] is not an option because it will crack.  Individual units not set in concrete, and placed in [[sand]] perform far better than concrete.<ref name=\"ICPI\" \/>  Before the paver was made from concrete either real [[stone]] or a clay product were used.\n\nThe first concrete pavers were shaped just like a brick, 4\u201d by 8\u201d (10&nbsp;cm x 20&nbsp;cm) and they were called Holland Stones and still are today.

As the widow of Daniel Parke Custis, Martha Dandridge Custis received a dower interest of one-third from the estate of her first husband Daniel Park Custis, property which she did not outright own but which she was able to use during her lifetime and from which she received a lifetime income.  The concept of \"dower property\" is further explained in this Encyclopedia Britannica article [http:\/\/www.britannica.com\/EBchecked\/topic\/170416\/dower Dower] and in the Wikipedia [[Dower]] article.  The usage in the George Washington article refers to the dower slaves, slaves who were not technically owned by the Washingtons themselves but were held in a type of temporary trust as dower property and as property would have been eventually intended to be passed on to her children by Custis.

However, since liberation, Christianity (particularly Protestantism) flourished, going from near obscurity to being believed by (IIRC) 35+% of Koreans in some 50 years... which is unique relative to, say Europe, which took hundreds of years for Christianity--as well as Protestantism later on--to take hold there.\n\n...or something along those lines. In any case, I don't think enough is said in the quick summary of \"what Koreans believe in\" in terms of Christianity. -- [[Special:Contributions\/66.92.0.62|66.92.0.62]] ([[User talk:66.92.0.62|talk]]) 20:58, 27 September 2010 (UTC)\n\n== Chinese or Korean? ==\n\nHow do you separate the  Korean's culture from Sino cultures?

It's hard to list all the differences, but many of these differences are very fundamental, which makes Korean culture distinct from Chinese culture. The traditional dress is definitely not the same. The Korean language is also completely unrelated to Chinese (though it has many words borrowed from Chinese), and Korean food is definitely unique in its own right and differs from northern Chinese cuisines significantly. While Korean buildings may look similar to Chinese and Japanese buildings at first sight, a trained eye can distinguish them very easily.

This association was so prevalent that a a lot of physicians, most of them county practitioners, sought the permission of local churches before prescribing medicines, particularly in case of those patients who were diagnosed with sexually transmitted diseases and other critical diseases. In case of surgeries, a lot of surgeons sought prior church approval, and this practice was so prevalent that it achieved the status of a compulsory custom in some regions.\" --[[User:Foghlopy|Foghlopy]] ([[User talk:Foghlopy#top|talk]]) 12:42, 1 April 2011 (UTC)\n\n:::That's strange, the 1958 edition, which I believe is what you cited, is available on [http:\/\/books.google.co.uk\/books?id=pGRsAAAAMAAJ Google books] in snippet view, but I can't get hits on any of that.  In particular, \"Meng\", \"Zhang Liang\" or ''chinese stethoscope'' do not come up.  Same goes for the [http:\/\/books.google.co.uk\/books?id=YEFrAAAAMAAJ 1947 edition].  I'll take it on good faith that those are fair quotations, but would you mind e-mailing me a scan of those two pages?  In any case I would still maintain that describing the \"Meng\" as a precursor of the modern stethoscope is misleading.  Your source does not seem to support the idea that Laennec's stethoscope is in any way a descendent of the Meng.

The contrast between the foreground colour and the background colour is low, which means that it may be difficult or impossible for people with visual impairments to read it.\n\nTo correct this problem, a group of editors [[Template talk:Infobox television season#Colour|have decided]] to '''remove support''' for invalid colours from [[Template:Infobox television season]] and other television season templates after '''1 September 2015'''. If you would still like to use custom colours for the infobox and episode list in this article after that date, please ensure that the colours meet the [http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20\/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html WCAG AAA standard].\n\nTo test whether a colour combination is AAA-compliant you can use [http:\/\/snook.ca\/technical\/colour_contrast\/colour.html#fg=33FF33,bg=333333 Snook's colour contrast tool]. If your background colour is dark, then please test it against a foreground colour of \"FFFFFF\" (white). If it is light, please test it against a foreground colour of \"000000\" (black). The tool needs to say \"YES\" in the box for \"WCAG 2 AAA Compliant\" when you input the foreground and the background colour. You can generally make your colour compliant by adjusting the \"Value (%)\" fader in the middle box.\n\nPlease be sure to change the invalid colour in every place that it appears, including the infobox, the episode list, and the series overview table. If you have any questions about this, please ask on [[Template talk:Infobox television season]].

Although many of the lines were originally built by different companies, they were consolidated under the control of the Everett-Moore syndicate, a Cleveland-based group of investors. The company incorporated on December 31, 1900, and continued to expand into the early 1920s through new construction and the acquisition of smaller concerns. After the DUR acquired the Detroit-Jackson line in 1907, it operated more than {{convert|400|mi|km}} of interurban lines and {{convert|187|mi|km}} of street city street railway lines.\n\nBeginning in 1922, however, the DUR began a process of devolution when it sold the local [[Detroit, Michigan]] streetcar system to the city, under the management of the [[Department of Street Railways]] (DSR). The company continued to abandon or sell properties throughout the 1920s; on September 26, 1928, the remainder was reorganized as the [[Eastern Michigan Railways]] (EMR).{{sfn|Schram|Henning|Andrews|1988|p=164}}\n\nIn addition to their Michigan holdings, the Detroit United Railway also owned the [[Transit Windsor|Sandwich, Windsor & Amherstburg Railway]], an [[interurban]] [[Tram|trolley]] line linking [[Windsor, Ontario]] with the towns of [[Tecumseh, Ontario]] to its east, and to [[La Salle, Ontario]] and [[Amherstburg, Ontario]] to its southwest.  This was purchased in 1901, and sold in 1920.  Remnants of the DUR in the Windsor area to this day include the [[Ganatchio Trail]] [[bike path]] (along former Claireview Street, the original SW&A alignment), and the older bridge foundations on Front Road over River Canard.<ref>http:\/\/www.internationalmetropolis.com\/2007\/06\/29\/tecumseh-dur-station\/<\/ref>\n\n== Publications ==\n* Electric railway service \/ Publicity Dept., Detroit United Lines.

The interference can be any physical contact with the chattel in a quantifiable way, or any dispossession of the chattel (whether by taking it, destroying it, or barring the owner's access to it).  As opposed to the greater wrong of [[Conversion (law)|conversion]], trespass to chattels is argued to be actionable ''per se''.\n\nThe origin of the concept comes from the original [[writ]] of [[trespass]] ''de bonis asportatis''. As in most other forms of trespass, [[Legal remedy|remedy]] can only be obtained once it is proven that there was direct interference regardless of damage being done, and the infringing party has failed to disprove either negligence or intent.\n\nIn some common-law countries such as the United States and Canada, a remedy for trespass to chattels can only be obtained if the direct interference was sufficiently substantial to amount to dispossession, or alternatively where there had been an injury proximately related to the chattel. (See [[Restatement (Second) of Torts]], 1965.)\n\n==United States law==\nThe Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 217 defines trespass to chattels as \"intentionally\u2026 dispossessing another of the chattel, or using or intermeddling with a chattel in the possession of another.\" Harm to personal property or diminution of its quality, condition or value as a result of a defendant's use can also result in liability under \u00a7 218(b) of the Restatement. \n\nCertain specific circumstances may lend themselves to liability for the action.  The Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 218 states further that:\n\nOne who commits a trespass to a chattel is subject to liability to the possessor of the chattel if, but only if,\n{{quote|\n(a) he dispossesses the other of the chattel, or<br\/>\n(b) the chattel is impaired as to its condition, quality, or value, or<br\/>\n(c) the possessor is deprived of the use of the chattel for a substantial time, or<br\/>\n(d) bodily harm is caused to the possessor, or harm is caused to some person or thing in which the possessor has a legally  protected interest.}}\n\nThe trespass to chattels cause of action, frequently asserted in recent years against Internet advertisers and email spammers, is often included in complaints against spyware companies.  These electronic messaging cases, and their progeny, which have cropped up over the last decade, will typically turn on the situations described in (b) or (d), and, as detailed below, the question of harm caused is a big issue.\n\nIn sum, the basic elements of a claim of trespass to chattels are: 1) the lack of the plaintiff's consent to the trespass, 2) interference or intermeddling with possessory interest, and 3) the intentionality of the defendant's actions.  Actual damage is not necessarily a required element of a trespass to chattels claim.<ref>See, e.g., ''Hawkins v. Hawkins'', 101 N.C. App. 529, 532, 400 S.E.2d 472, 475 (1999).<\/ref><ref name=Shields>Marjorie A. Shields, ''Applicability of Common-Law Trespass Actions to Electronic Communications'', 107 A.L.R.5th 549.<\/ref>\n\n==Features of the claim==\n\n; Lack of consent\n:A vendor can attempt to dispute a trespass claim on the grounds that the user consented to the terms of the contract. Even if consent was given for certain access, a user may still have a valid trespass to chattels complaint if the vendor has exceeded the contractual terms, if the contract is found to misrepresent the actual functioning of the product, or if the consent has been withdrawn. A vendor can be held liable for \"any use exceeding the consent\" given. (Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 256). See, e.g., ''[[CompuServe Inc. v. Cyber Promotions, Inc.]]'', discussed below.\n\n; Actual harm\n: The precise criteria for ascertaining actual harm varies among states.  In California, for instance, an electronic message <ref>CANNOT<\/ref> can be deemed a trespass where the message interferes with the target computer's operation, as long as a plaintiff can demonstrate either actual hardware damage or actual impaired functioning (See ''[[Intel Corp. v. Hamidi]]'', 30 Cal.4th 1342 (2003)). But the general concept of requiring impaired computer functioning has been adopted consistently and in showing impaired computer functioning, courts have usually emphasized system unavailability.\n\n; Intentionality\n: In clarifying the meaning of intentionality in the context of a trespass to chattels claim, \u00a7 217 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts states that \"intention is present when an act is done for the purpose of using or otherwise intermeddling with a chattel or with knowledge that such an intermeddling will, to a [[Substantial certainty doctrine|substantial certainty]], result from the act,\" and that, furthermore, \"[i]t is not necessary that the actor should know or have reason to know that such intermeddling is a violation of the possessory rights of another.\"\n\n[[Damages]] from a trespass claim are limited to the actual harm sustained by the plaintiff (which can include economic loss consequent on the trespass - e.g. loss of profit on a damaged chattel). In cases of dispossession, the plaintiff is always entitled to damages if they can prove the dispossession occurred, even if no quantifiable harm can be proven.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nA related tort is [[conversion (law)|conversion]], which involves an exercise of control over another's [[chattel]] justifying restitution of the [[chattel|chattel's]] full value. Some actions constitute trespass and conversion; in these cases, a plaintiff must choose which claim to make based on what amount of damages they seek to recover.{{dubious|date=May 2012}}\n\n== In the electronic age ==\n{{further|Computer trespass}}\n\nThe common law tort of trespass to chattels has been invoked in the modern context of electronic communications to combat the proliferation of unsolicited bulk email, commonly known as [[E-mail spam|spam]].<ref name=Shields \/>  In addition, several companies have successfully used the tort to block certain people, usually competitors, from accessing their servers. Though courts initially endorsed a broad application of this legal theory in the electronic context, more recently other jurists have narrowed its scope. As trespass to chattels is extended further to computer networks, some fear that plaintiffs are using this cause of action to quash fair competition and to deter the exercise of free speech; consequently, critics call for the limitation of the tort to instances where the plaintiff can demonstrate actual damages.\n\n=== Rules ===\nThe trespass to chattels tort punishes anyone who substantially interferes with the use of another's personal property, or chattels. Plaintiffs must show that the offender had intentional physical contact with the chattel and that the contact caused some substantial interference or damage. The courts that imported this common law doctrine into the digital world reasoned that electrical signals traveling across networks and through proprietary servers may constitute the contact necessary to support a trespass claim. Applying this common law action to computer networks, plaintiffs must first prove that they received some type of electronic communication (typically bulk e-mail or spam) that the defendant intentionally sent to interfere with the plaintiff's interest in his or her property and second that this communication caused a quantifiable harm to their tangible property, such as impaired functioning of the computer, network or server.<ref name=eBay>''eBay v. Bidder's Edge'', 100 F.Supp.2d 1058 (N.D. Cal. 2000).<\/ref>\n\n=== Early applications of trespass to chattels to computer networks ===\n\nIn the late 1990s, when the World Wide Web was in its infancy, courts were more receptive to extending the trespass to chattels tort to the electronic context. In ''[[CompuServe Inc. v. Cyber Promotions, Inc.]]'', a 1997 case that was the first to extend the trespass theory to computer networks, a federal district court held that a marketing company's mass mailing of a high volume of unsolicited advertisement emails to CompuServe subscribers constituted an actionable trespass to chattels.<ref name=CompuServe>''CompuServe Inc. v. Cyber Promotions, Inc.'', 962 F.Supp. 1015 (S.D.Ohio 1997).<\/ref>  CompuServe customers repeatedly received unwanted advertisements from Cyber Promotions, a company that specialized in sending marketing email in bulk. Cyber Promotions also modified its equipment and falsified other information to circumvent CompuServe's anti-spam measures. Due to the high volume of email, CompuServe claimed damage to its servers as well as money lost dealing with customer complaints and dissatisfaction. CompuServe also extended its damages claim to its subscribers who spent time deleting unwanted email. The court held that Cyber Promotions's intentional use of CompuServe's proprietary server was an actionable trespass to chattels and granted a preliminary injunction enjoining the spammer from sending unsolicited advertisements to any email address maintained by CompuServe. Cyber Promotions' persistence in sending email to CompuServe's servers after receiving notification that CompuServe no longer consented to the use weighed heavily in favor of a finding of trespass. \n\nA trio of 1998 cases in the Eastern District of Virginia involving America Online more firmly established the use of the trespass to chattels tort as a spam-fighting tool. In ''[[America Online, Inc. v. IMS]]'', the court held that the owner of a marketing company committed trespass to chattels against an [[Internet service provider]]'s (ISP) computer network by sending 60 million unauthorized email advertisements to the ISP's subscribers after being notified that the spam was unauthorized.<ref>''America Online, Inc. v. IMS'', 24 F. Supp. 2d 548 (E.D. Va. 1998).<\/ref>  The court found that the defendant, intentionally and without authorization, caused contact with the plaintiff's computer network by sending the bulk email messages. Such contact injured the plaintiff's business goodwill and diminished the functioning of its computer network. \n\nSimilarly, in ''America Online, Inc. v. LCGM, Inc.'', a company engaging in pornographic website advertising sent a deluge of spam to AOL's customers, and, in so doing, also forged the AOL domain name in an effort to trick customers into opening the emails.<ref>''America Online, Inc. v. LCGM, Inc.'', 46 F.Supp.2d 444 (E.D. Va. 1998).<\/ref>  The court once again held that a website operators' transmission of unsolicited bulk emails to customers of an ISP, using the provider's computers and computer network, constituted trespass to chattels. \n\nIn ''America Online, Inc. v. Prime Data Systems, Inc.'', the defendants sent millions of spam emails to AOL subscribers advertising computer software programs designed to facilitate bulk emailing by allowing users to harvest email addresses from the plaintiff's member directories, chat rooms, and electronic bulletin boards.<ref>''America Online, Inc. v. Prime Data Systems, Inc.'', 1998 WL 34016692 (E.D. Va. 1998).<\/ref> The defendants also used technology designed to avoid AOL's spam filtering mechanisms. The defendants frequently used false and deceptive \"headers\" in email messages to make it appear as if AOL had sent the messages. The increased demand on AOL's servers resulting from the spam caused substantial delays of up to 24 hours in the delivery of all email to AOL members, forcing AOL to temporarily stop accepting any new messages. As the spam problem grew worse, AOL had to purchase millions of dollars worth of additional equipment to increase the capacity of its servers to handle the volume of email. The court held that this activity constituted a trespass to chattels and awarded injunctive relief, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, as well as damages.\n\n=== Beyond spam: screen scraping and data harvesting ===\nSince the early spam cases, courts have extended the electronic trespass to chattels theory even further to encompass screen-scraping and other data \"harvesting.\" [[Screen-scraping]] is the practice of taking information from another website, generally through the use of search agent software, and \"harvesting\" the data for one's own commercial use. For example, travel websites frequently use this tactic to offer a host of options and prices gleaned from various airlines' sites. Because the courts have entertained such litigation, some companies have specifically banned the conduct in their terms and conditions statements.<ref>See, e.g. [http:\/\/www.wawa.com\/WawaWeb\/Terms.aspx Wawa's] website terms and conditions, which forbids users to employ screen scraping programs.<\/ref>\n\nIn ''[[eBay v. Bidder's Edge]]'' (2000), eBay successfully used the trespass to chattels tort to prevent Bidder's Edge from employing spiders to cull information about its auctions to display on its own website.<ref name=eBay \/> Although Bidder's Edge's robots only consumed a small percentage of eBay's computer resources, the court noted that the plaintiff need not demonstrate current substantial interference as conduct which constituted a use of another's property is enough to sustain a trespass to chattels claim. In light of this, the court found that eBay had demonstrated a sufficient likelihood of future injury to warrant granting a permanent injunction: \"If the court were to hold otherwise, it would likely encourage other auction aggregators to crawl the eBay site, potentially to the point of denying effective access to eBay's customers.\"<ref name=eBay \/>\n\n''[[Register.com, Inc. v. Verio, Inc.]]'' (2000) is a further example of this temporary trend in which plaintiffs did not have to demonstrate any real interference.<ref>''[[Register.com, Inc. v. Verio, Inc.]]'', 126 F. Supp. 2d 238 (S.D.N.Y. 2000).<\/ref>  Register.com, a domain name registry service, sued competitor Verio for using Register.com's proprietary WHOIS look-up service to find potential leads among its customer base. The court found that, by continuing to access Register.com's online customer database after being told to stop, Verio was trespassing on Register.com's WHOIS server. Register.com had specifically withdrawn its consent to Verio's use of search robots to review Register.com's customer list. The court held that Verio caused harm to Register.com's files through the use of these search robots and that the searches improperly taxed Register.com's server capacity. \n\nThese holdings gave the court license to expand the applicability of trespass to chattels to computer networks even further. In ''Oyster Software v. Forms Processing'' (2001), the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|Northern District of California]] determined that a plaintiff need not demonstrate any physical interference with a server at all to sustain a trespass to chattels claim and consequently denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment, even though there was no evidence of damage to the plaintiff's computer system.<ref name=Oyster>''Oyster Software v. Forms Processing'', 2001 WL 1736382 (N.D.Cal. 2001).<\/ref> Although Oyster conceded that there was no evidence that the defendant's activities had interfered in any way with the functioning of Oyster's computer system, the court nonetheless denied FPI's motion for summary judgment. According to the court, following the decision in ''eBay'', plaintiffs only need to demonstrate that the defendant's actions \"amounted to a 'use' of Plaintiff's computer,\" and the court determined that copying the metatags amounted to a use.<ref name=Oyster \/>\n\nThese cases indicate that, at least in California, a plaintiff did not have to demonstrate any kind of actual interference with the computer system to successfully claim trespass to chattels.\n\n=== The backlash against the tort's expansion ===\n\nHowever, some courts subsequently limited tort claims for electronic trespasses, in that a complaining party may be unable to recover for lack of real harm if the party did not suffer any tangible damage to their property. \n\nThe Supreme Court of California reversed the trend exemplified by ''Oyster'' in the seminal case ''Intel v. Hamidi'' (2003), reaffirming the need for a demonstration either of actual interference with the physical functionality of the computer system or of the likelihood that this would happen in the future.<ref name=Hamidi>''Intel v. Hamidi'', 30 Cal.4th 1342 (Cal. 2003).<\/ref> Although Intel conceded that Hamidi's emails caused neither physical damage nor any disruption to their computer system, they alleged that the economic productivity lost due to the disruption caused by the emails could sustain a trespass claim. The Supreme Court of California disagreed, holding that the tort does not extend to claims in which the electronic communication involved \"neither damages the recipient computer system nor impairs its function.\"<ref name=Hamidi \/> In reaching this conclusion, the court criticized the understanding of ''eBay'' advanced in ''Oyster'', explaining that previous cases in which courts have found trespass to chattels in the electronic setting have involved either \"actual or threatened interference with the computers' function.\"<ref name=Hamidi \/> To that effect, the court in ''Oyster'' misconstrued the holding in ''eBay''; trespass requires more than use a use--it requires an actual or threatened interference with the physical functionality of the system. \n\nAlthough the vast majority of states have yet to determine the applicability of the trespass to chattels theory, the courts that have addressed the issue have applied ''Intel'' and required that the plaintiff demonstrate damage to the computer system. A [[New York Supreme Court|supreme court in New York]] in [[School of Visual Arts v. Kuprewicz]] denied the defendant's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on the trespass to chattels claim because the plaintiff had alleged actual damage to the functionality of the computer system, which Intel requires; the defendant had sent enough e-mails that it reduced the computer system's functionality and drained the hard drive's memory.<ref>''School of Visual Arts v. Kuprewicz'', 771 N.Y.S.2d 804 (N.Y. Sup. 2003).<\/ref> The Fourth Circuit in ''Omega World Travel v. Mummagraphics, Inc.'' also followed ''Intel'', although this resulted in granting a motion for summary judgment for the defendant because the plaintiff did not allege any actual damage on its computer system.<ref>''Omega World Travel v. Mummagraphics, Inc.'', 469 F.3d 348 (4th. Cir. 2006).<\/ref> The court clarified that Oklahoma courts have yet to recognize the validity of a trespass to chattels claim based on an electronic intrusion to a computer system, but if it were to recognize it, the plaintiff would need to allege more than nominal damages, which in this case it had not.\n\n=== Cautions on expanding the tort in the electronic context ===\n\nAlthough a number of commentators have expressed enthusiasm over the increasing \"propertization\" of intellectual property (that is to say, the increased application of real property doctrines to intangible property) and the extension of the trespass to chattels doctrine to computer networks,<ref>''See, e.g., David M. Fritch, \"Click Here For Lawsuit \u2013 Trespass to Chattels in Cyberspace,\" 9 J. Tech. L. & Pol'y 31 (June 2004).<\/ref> a number of detractors have expressed concern over the ramifications of extending the theory to protect electronic communications that do not actually damage the computer systems in question but only cause nominal damage due to their content.<ref>[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], [http:\/\/w2.eff.org\/spam\/Intel_v_Hamidi\/20000118_eff_amicus.html Amicus Brief in ''Intel v.

Rev. 23 (2007).<\/ref>  Primarily, these critics worry that extending trespass to chattels in this fashion would stifle free speech on the internet because any unwelcome email might constitute a trespass and may subject the sender not only to civil liability under the trespass theory but to criminal liability as well.<ref>EFF Amicus Brief in ''Intel v.

It was founded in 1974 as the Douglas Museum and Library, renamed the Museum of Flying in 1989, closed in 2002, and reopened in 2012 in a new facility. The Museum exhibits the history of aviation, focusing on aviation history in Southern California.\n\n==History==\nOriginally founded in 1974 by Donald Douglas Jr. as the Douglas Museum and Library located on the South side of the [[Santa Monica Airport]], the Museum migrated to the North side of the Airport and reopened as the Museum of Flying in April 1989. The Museum gradually grew to a collection of over 50 [[Antique aircraft|vintage aircraft]], many of which were built in Southern California and are still in flight-ready condition.<ref>Ogden 2007<\/ref><ref>Parker 2013<\/ref>\n\nThe museum's collection of artifacts, exhibits, and aviation art chronicle the development of aviation in Southern California. The anchor aircraft for the Museum was the [[Douglas World Cruiser]], \"New Orleans\" which made the first circumnavigation of the globe along with its sister ship, \"Chicago\", in 1924. The \"Chicago\" now resides at the [[National Air and Space Museum|Smithsonian Institution's National Air & Space Museum]].\n\nOver the next several years, the museum played host to many historic and memorable special events and activities, including \"A Walk on the Moon\" in 1999 in which seven [[NASA]] lunar astronauts were present and honored for their advancement in the discovery of space and the moon. In 2000, the museum held the 60th Commemorative Anniversary of the Battle of Britain. Attendees at this event witnessed first-hand accounts of this epic air battle, live and in person from several RAF and Luftwaffe pilots who joined us for this milestone occasion.\n\nOne of the most popular programs of the Museum was the children's A's Award Flight Program. On pre-selected dates, children achieving the letter grade \"A\" in any academic subject could receive a free airplane ride as a reward for dedication toward education. The museum also featured a number of other educational programs for both children and adults; including weekend family workshops and a volunteer presentation series.\n\nThe Museum was forced to temporarily close in July 2002 due to economic challenges. Since that time, Museum officials have been in discussion with the City of Santa Monica on a suitable new location at the Santa Monica Airport. Recently, the Museum executed a lease agreement with the City of Santa Monica for the leasehold at 3100 Airport Avenue. The new Museum expansion and remodeling project is estimated to cost nearly $2 million. Construction and the Capital Campaign to support it are in progress.\n\n==Exhibits and features==\nThe Museum of Flying at the Santa Monica Airport in Santa Monica, California, features a display and exhibit area of nearly {{convert|22000|sqft|m2}}.\n\nThe new Museum provides displays and interpretive exhibits on the history of flight and the development and growth of the aviation and aerospace industry in Southern California. The Museum places heavy emphasis on the Douglas Aircraft Company and the history of the Santa Monica Airport.\n\nThe new Museum features nearly two dozen aircraft chronicling flight from its beginning with a replica [[Wright Flyer]], all the way to the jet age, with the [[Bede BD-5|BD-5]] micro jet and the FedEx [[Boeing 727]] nose section. The Museum also features a broad collection of aviation art, rare artifacts, and ephemera from famous aviators, as well as an extensive collection of photographs of historic aircraft and aircraft manufacturing.<ref>Parker 2013, pp. 26, 34, 51\u201356, 58, 90, 106, 108, 125, 128.<\/ref> \n\nThe museum creates a hands-on interactive and education center for children that includes a [[Lockheed T-33]] cockpit trainer, a [[Convair 240]] nose, and the world famous Jimmy Babinski K-3 mini flight simulator that allows children to learn about pitch, yaw, and roll. The Jimmy Babinski K-3 flight simulator also known as \"The Babinskinator K-3000\" was developed after years of extensive research and trials by Mr. Babinski. If lucky, one can meet Mr. Babinski as he is known to volunteer on the weekends giving extensive tours. Unfortunately, in the new year Mr. Babinski was forced out amidst other rumors.\n\nThe Mezzanine of the new Museum features a recreation of the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]] Executive Board room, and a recreation of the office of [[Donald Wills Douglas, Sr.|Donald W. Douglas]], Founder & Chairman of the Douglas Aircraft Company. The mezzanine also houses the new Museum Theater and Screening Room.\n\nNew to the museum is the FS 3000 simulator which offers 360 degrees of full range motion with surround sound and HD 3-D capabilities. This is the only simulator of its kind in the Los Angeles area.\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Ogden, Bob.

About half of it\u2019s content are links to difficult-to-find recreation maps.  The other half of the content are original map data created using GPS and interfaced with National Geographic TOPO! map software (an extended user\u2019s agreement with the National Geographic Society).  These TOPO! maps were scanned versions of the USGS topographic maps and should be considered valid as a cited source.  Even though the overlayed map data created using a GPS is a Self-Published Source, the remainder of the maps are unarguabley accurate.  Even though the GPS data may have small errors resulting from technical limitations, the data should be considered as reliable and as accurate as reasonabley possible.  These map pages have been linked from Wikipedia content as references by the author of both Connecticut Explorer\u2019s Guide and the Wikipedia content.  The geographic descriptions of the subject area is mostly derived from the USGS-sourced TOPO! maps used on the pages of Connecticut Explorer\u2019s Guide.  The Wikipedia content descriptions of the overlayed map data are mere mentions of existing recreational opportunities of that geographic area and not reliant on a 100% accurate map.  Connecticut Explorer\u2019s Guide has been used as  a reference in good faith in order to increase Wikipedia\u2019s content about these Connecticut locations.  \nAdditionally, Connecticut Explorer\u2019s Guide has been indexed as a Digital Geodata resource on UCONN\u2019s Magic Library website.

It was not until their second album ''[[Life (Cardigans album)|Life]]'' (1995) that an international reputation was secured. Their popularity rose when their single \"[[Lovefool]]\", from the album ''[[First Band on the Moon]]'' (1996), was included in the soundtrack to the 1996 film version of ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]''.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"\/>  Other singles included \"[[Erase\/Rewind]]\" and \"[[My Favourite Game]]\" from the album ''[[Gran Turismo (album)|Gran Turismo]]'' (1998). After a two-year hiatus the band returned recording and releasing their fourth album ''[[Long Gone Before Daylight]]'' (2003) a mellower [[country music|country]]-laden record. Their last album ''[[Super Extra Gravity]]'' (2005), a continuation of the country music infused by pop sensibility and further maturing in the band's sound, was the best-selling Swedish album of that year.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} After a 2006 tour, the band embarked on a long five-year break from musical activities, before reuniting in 2012 to play several concerts. Overall the band sold over 15 million albums worldwide.\n\n==History==\n\n===First years: 1992\u20131994===\n[[Peter Svensson]] and [[Magnus Sveningsson]], both heavy metal musicians, formed the group on 31 October 1992 in [[J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping]], [[Sweden]], with drummer [[Bengt Lagerberg]], keyboardist [[Lars-Olof Johansson]] and lead singer [[Nina Persson]].<ref>{{cite web\n| last = Sveningsson\n| first = Magnus\n| title = The Cardigans official website: Ask the Band\n| url=http:\/\/www.cardigans.com\/?sid=qa&id=13\n| accessdate = 2007-11-01 }}<\/ref> Living together in a small apartment, The Cardigans recorded a [[demo tape]] with Persson providing lead vocals on only one of the songs towards the end of the tracklist. [[A&R]] man Ola Hermanson heard the demo and signed the band to his Trampolene imprint. In 1994, they released their debut album ''[[Emmerdale (album)|Emmerdale]]'' in Sweden and Japan; it was re-released internationally in 1997. The album included the Swedish radio hit \"Rise & Shine\", which was later voted the best of 1994 in a poll in ''[[Slitz]]'' magazine.\n\n===Commercial success: 1995\u20132000===\nThe remainder of 1994 was spent touring Europe and recording ''[[Life (Cardigans album)|Life]]'', which was released worldwide in 1995. ''Life'' became an international success, selling more than a million copies and achieving [[Platinum album|platinum status]] in Japan. In 1996, ''Life'' was released under the label [[Minty Fresh]] in the [[United States|US]], but this release was essentially a compilation of tracks from ''Emmerdale'' and ''Life''.\n\nAfter their success with ''Life'', The Cardigans signed to [[Mercury Records]], under which they released ''[[First Band on the Moon]]'' worldwide in 1996. \"[[Lovefool]]\" was a hit worldwide, particularly in the US and Japan, where the album reached platinum status in three weeks. The album also achieved [[music recording sales certification|gold sales status]] in the US. \"Lovefool\" was shown on [[MTV]] in the late 1990s as a [[music video]] with clips from the 1996 hit film ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]'' starring [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Claire Danes]]. It also featured in the film ''[[Cruel Intentions]]'' (1999).\n\nIn 1997, the band played themselves on the graduation episode of ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' as the featured entertainment at the fictional California High School's graduation party, hosted by [[Kelly Taylor (90210)|Kelly Taylor]]'s dad, Bill Taylor. The band performed \"[[Lovefool]]\" and \"[[Been It]].\"\n\n1998's ''[[Gran Turismo (album)|Gran Turismo]]'' was followed by a long hiatus during which the band members pursued solo side projects. The same year they also released a [[compilation album]] of rare [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]s, ''[[The Other Side of the Moon (album)|The Other Side of the Moon]]'' as a Japan-only release. The video of the song \"My Favourite Game\" was censored by MTV for showing reckless driving. Despite this, it went on to become their second global hit song. \"My Favourite Game\" was featured on the [[soundtrack]] of the [[PlayStation]] video game ''[[Gran Turismo (series)|Gran Turismo 2]]'' in the intro movie on CD1. That year also saw their song \"Deuce\" appearing on ''[[The X-Files: The Album]]''.\n[[Image:The Cardigans.jpg|thumb|The Cardigans performing in June 2004.]]\n\nIn 1999 the Cardigans recorded a duet cover of [[Talking Heads]]' \"[[Burning Down the House]]\" with [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] for his album ''[[Reload (Tom Jones album)|Reload]]''.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"\/>\n\n===Back to spotlight and hiatus: 2002\u20132006===\nThe Cardigans returned in 2002 to record ''[[Long Gone Before Daylight]]'' (2003), a collection of songs mainly written by Persson and Svensson. ''Long Gone Before Daylight'' became one of the best selling albums in Sweden in 2003. After a two-year hiatus from their last album, it was released in Japan on March 19, 2003 and in Europe on March 24, 2003. Later it was also released in Canada (April 22, 2003) and the United States (May 25, 2004).\n\nThe album differs from the band's earlier works. Their familiar \"happy\" pop sound takes on a change to pop songs with more of an American [[country music]] influence. It is a much darker album than their previous works, and quieter than ''[[Gran Turismo (album)|Gran Turismo]]''. Indeed, even lead singer [[Nina Persson]] dyed her once light blonde hair to jet black, reflecting the band's change of mood.<ref>Amelia McDonell-Parry. [http:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/reviews\/album\/5204789\/review\/6085656 \"Long Gone Before Daylight : The Cardigans : Review\"], ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', 2004-07-24<\/ref> The album was produced by Per Sunding after the group's regular producer Tore Johanssen stepped down, feeling himself unable to provide the country sound the group wanted.\n\nCriticism was generally mixed to positive. Some found the change of direction welcome, and felt the band had matured, making songs that were even better than other experienced country-pop styled artists. Others missed the old pop sound, and accused the band of possibly being ashamed of their former \"happy\" pop sound. The first single of the album, \"[[For What It's Worth (The Cardigans song)|For What It's Worth]]\" was released on February 17, 2003. The second single was \"[[You're the Storm]]\" released on June 2, 2003. The third and final single was \"[[Live and Learn (The Cardigans song)|Live and Learn]]\" released on December 3, 2003. In the summer of 2004, The Cardigans toured with [[Liz Phair]], [[Katy Rose]] and [[Charlotte Martin]] on the [[Chicks With Attitude]] tour.\n\nOn 28 April 2005 the band's ''iTunes Originals'' album was released through iTunes. On 19 October 2005 the band released their sixth album ''[[Super Extra Gravity]]'' to generally favourable reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/music\/artists\/cardigans\/superextragravity?q=cardigans |title=The Cardigans: Super Extra Gravity (2006): Reviews |publisher=Metacritic.com |date=2006-09-19 |accessdate=2012-08-22}}<\/ref> ''Super Extra Gravity'' went straight to the #1 spot on the Swedish album chart and was certified gold (sales over 40,000). After the band finished promotional activities in fall 2006, the band entered an extended hiatus and devoted themselves to other projects.\n\n===Reunion and tour: 2012\u2013present===\nIn 2012 the Cardigans received a lucrative offer from [[Hultsfred Festival]] to perform the album ''[[Gran Turismo (album)|Gran Turismo]]'' in full, but Svensson declined to participate.<ref name=\"smartbeijing.com\">http:\/\/www.smartbeijing.com\/articles\/nightlife\/interview-magnus-sveningsson-the-cardigans<\/ref> After initial hesitation, the band decided to accept the offer \"as it felt like a good way of tearing us out of our strange new everyday life,\" according to Persson.<ref>http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/music\/musicblog\/2012\/apr\/26\/nina-persson-cardigans-reunion<\/ref> They recruited singer-songwriter [[:sv:Moto Boy|Oskar Humlebo]] to fill in for Svensson, who had no objection to the band touring without him, and asked their agent to seek more shows for them to play.<ref name=\"smartbeijing.com\"\/> Ultimately, the band made their live comeback with shows in Lund and Copenhagen ahead of Hultsfred, before playing in Poland, Finland, Russia, Indonesia, Taiwan and Japan, with a scheduled concert in Israel cancelled by the promoter.<ref>https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TheCardigansofficial\/posts\/10151098305190428<\/ref> Most of these shows involved performing ''Gran Turismo'' in full, followed by an assortment of hits from their other albums.\n\nStill with Humlebo in place of Svensson, the band played career-spanning sets when touring resumed during late 2013 with shows in Japan, China and Russia, followed by more dates in 2015 which took them to South Korea, Europe and South America. In interviews promoting her 2014 solo album ''[[Animal Heart]]'', Persson suggested that the success of their most recent live dates opened the possibility for future Cardigans recordings, though there were no firm plans. \"It's really fun to do greatest hits things, since there's nothing else, but I think if we continue having this much fun we would like to make another record, because we like to create new things,\" said Persson.<ref>http:\/\/www.billboard.com\/articles\/columns\/pop-shop\/5901103\/nina-persson-talks-animal-heart-solo-lp-the-cardigans-future<\/ref> The band's only scheduled show for 2016, so far, is at [[Kuusisaari]], [[Finland]] on 29 July with [[Opeth]], [[Lissie]] and [[Children of Bodom]] among others.<ref>http:\/\/www.songkick.com\/concerts\/26597154-cardigans-at-kuusisaari<\/ref>\n\n==Solo projects==\nDuring th\u0435 band's first break [[Nina Persson]] released an album as [[A Camp]], and Peter Svensson and Bengt Lagerberg worked on the project Paus with help from Joakim Berg from [[Kent (band)|Kent]], and Magnus Sveningsson recorded as [[Righteous Boy]].\n\nIn 2006, Sveningsson restarted their old label ''Trampolene'' and became an [[A&R]] for it. The first signing was the Swedish popband ''The Animal Five'', which was a minor success in Sweden and Germany.\n\nLagerberg and Johansson formed the group Brothers Of End, releasing a debut album ''The End'' in 2009, and a second album ''Mount Inside'' in 2011. A third album, ''Shakers Love'', was released in 2014, and Nina Persson appeared on the track \"Heat\".\n\nIn November 2006 Persson featured on ''[[The Cake Sale]]'', an album set up by [[Oxfam|Oxfam Ireland]]. It contained nine tracks from some of Ireland's leading artists. Proceeds from the album went to the [[fair trade]] campaign.\n\nPersson also appeared on the [[Manic Street Preachers]]' album ''[[Send Away the Tigers]]'' (May 2007), providing guest vocals on the UK Chart #2 single \"Your Love Alone Is Not Enough\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.hmv.co.uk\/hmvweb\/displayProductDetails.do?ctx=280;-1;-1;-1&sku=608370 |title=Albums : Send Away The Tigers (2007) |publisher=HMV.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-22}}<\/ref> She shared vocals with Manics frontman [[James Dean Bradfield]], who also appeared on stage with the band at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] 2007, and who has rated Peter Svensson as his second favourite guitarist.<ref>[http:\/\/www.manics.co.uk\/04\/lists\/james.php ] {{wayback|url=http:\/\/www.manics.co.uk\/04\/lists\/james.php |date=20060410141148 }}<\/ref>\n\nIn the band's break of 2007, Persson recorded the second A Camp album ''[[Colonia (A Camp album)|Colonia]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.cardigans.com\/?sid=article&pid=read&id=7011 |title=The Cardigans \u2013 Nina Persson breathes new life into A Camp |publisher=Cardigans.com |date=2007-05-09 |accessdate=2012-08-22}}<\/ref> which was released in early 2009.

[[Darrell Tryon]] (1968, 1974) combined these into a single family, with the exception of [[Murrinh-patha language|Murrinh-patha]]. \n\nHowever, such methodologies do not account for loan words. [[Ian Green]] found that the languages could not be shown to be related by the [[comparative method]], and so should be considered five independent families and [[language isolate]]s.<ref name=\"Green 2003\">Green, I. \"The Genetic Status of Murrinh-patha\" in Evans, N., ed. \"The Non-Pama-Nyungan Languages of Northern Australia: comparative studies of the continent\u2019s most linguistically complex region\".

He completed his military education in 1992, when he met fellow adventurer-to-be [[Torry Larsen]], also of [[M\u00f8re og Romsdal]]. Gjeldnes served in the [[Marinejegerkommandoen|Norwegian Naval Special Operations Command]] until 1997.\n\n==Expeditions==\nTogether with [[Torry Larsen]], Rune Gjeldnes travelled across [[Greenland]] in 1996. In 1997, he planned and completed the \"Arctic Ocean 2000\" expedition&mdash;a 109-day, 2,100-[[kilometre|kilometer]] trip&mdash;becoming the first to cross the [[Arctic Ocean]] without resupplies. In 1998, Gjeldnes and [[Bj\u00f8rn Loe]] became the first to [[paddling|paddle]] the [[Rio Merevari]] in [[Venezuela]]. Gjeldnes participated in [[North Pole]] expeditions in 1997 and 1998, crossed [[Baffin Island]] in northern [[Canada]] in 1998, and later the same year climbed [[Aconcagua|Mt Aconcagua]] ({{convert|6,959|m|ft|abbr=on}}). From 1999 to 2000, he again worked for the [[Royal Norwegian Navy|Royal Norwegian Navy (RNoN)]].\n\n===The Longest March===\nIn February 2006, Rune Gjeldnes completed \"The Longest March\", a three-month {{convert|4,800|km|mi|adj=on}} solo [[cross-country skiing|ski trek]] across the [[South Pole]] region, becoming the first person to cross that area alone without being resupplied. His route went from [[Queen Maud Land]], over the Pole, and on to [[Terra Nova Bay]]. The final couple of weeks of the journey had to be made on foot, as Gjeldnes had lost one of his mountain skis off his sled, this before having to descend a glacier of {{convert|2,000|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[above mean sea level|ASL]] in order to reach his destination. The distance is the equivalent of the distance between New York City and San Francisco by road across the United States. The expedition had a scientific element as Gjeldnes took regular blood samples of himself to be used in studies of the human immune system under extreme conditions.\n\nHe now holds the records of the longest ski journey without being resupplied and the longest ski journey generally. He is the only person to ski across the [[North Pole]], the South Pole and [[Greenland]] without resupply.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http:\/\/www.rune-gjeldnes.com Rune Gjeldnes] &ndash; Official website\n*[http:\/\/www.tv2.no\/ao2000\/ Arctic Ocean 2000] &ndash; Official expedition website\n*[http:\/\/www.extreme-planet.com\/exp\/seal\/ The Longest March web page] &ndash; From the website of SEAL Adventure, Gjeldnes' company\n*[http:\/\/pub.tv2.no\/nettavisen\/friluftsliv\/tilantarktis\/ The Longest March] &ndash; Official expedition website\n*[http:\/\/www.aftenposten.no\/english\/sports\/article1214008.ece \"Adventurer finishes polar trek\"] &ndash; By Arnfinn Mauren, ''[[Aftenposten]]'', 3 February 2006\n*[http:\/\/www.mil.no\/sjo\/start\/aktuelt\/gjeldnes\/ RNoN The Longest March page] {{no icon}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gjeldnes, Rune}}\n[[Category:1971 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Royal Norwegian Navy personnel]]\n[[Category:People from M\u00f8re og Romsdal]]","timestamp":"20160410100224","user-timestamp":"20150410100224"},{"title":"File:Halifax Montage August 2015.jpg","content":"==Summary==\n{{Information\n|Description = A montage of sights in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

Cappo played a wide array of hardcore music on the program, largely culled from his massive collection of records, rare unsigned EPs, and demo tapes. During  this time, Cappo enthusiastically supported local hardcore shows including gigs by many early hardcore bands such as No Milk on Tuesday, 76% Uncertain, Seizure, End Product, and Abusive Action, and was often mentioned in the liner notes of their records.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n== Youth of Today ==\n\nAlong with guitarist [[John Porcelly]] (also known as Porcell) Cappo started the seminal hardcore band [[Youth of Today]] in 1985, which quickly became one of the most well known bands in the [[New York hardcore]] scene. Based on their [[Straight edge]] ethics and a fast, aggressive sound, they created a subgenre known as [[Youth crew]], influencing a large number of bands.<ref name=\"allmusic-yot\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p14782|pure_url=yes}}|title=Youth of Today Biography|last=True|first=Christopher M.|work=allmusic.com|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=April 4, 2010}}<\/ref> An important figure in the early days of Youth of Today was [[Kevin Seconds]], singer of the [[Reno, NV]] band [[7 Seconds (band)|7 Seconds]]. Kevin not only influenced the band, but also released their first EP, \"Can't Close My Eyes\" on his Positive Force Records. Before disbanding in 1990, Youth of Today released two 7\" EPs (one later remixed and released as a 12\") and two LPs, widely considered to be some of the most influential American [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] records of their time.\n\n== Revelation Records ==\n\nIn 1987, along with Jordan Cooper, Cappo started [[Revelation Records]]. The label's first release was [[Warzone (band)|Warzone]]'s \"Lower East Side Crew\". This was soon followed by a compilation entitled New York Hardcore 1987: Together, or simply the Together Compilation. This compilation included tracks by [[Youth of Today]] and [[Bold (band)|Bold]], (formerly [[Crippled Youth]]). This was also the first time bands like [[Gorilla Biscuits]], [[Sick of it All]], and [[Side By Side (band)|Side By Side]] would be recorded and heard all over the world. Revelation would soon expand its roster westward, releasing records from [[California]] bands like [[Chain of Strength]] and No For an Answer.

It was first published in 1919 in the journal ''Internationale Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Psychoanalyse'' and then, after translation into English by Dorian Feigenbaum, in the ''[[Psychoanalytic Quarterly]]'' in 1933.<ref name=\"Tausk_1933\">Tausk V (1933) [http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3330285\/pdf\/184.pdf On the origin of the influencing machine in schizophrenia]. ''[[Psychoanalytic Quarterly]]'', 2, 519-556.<\/ref>\n\nThe paper describes Tausk's observations and [[psychoanalytic]] interpretation of a type of [[Paranoia|paranoid]] [[delusion]] that occurs in patients diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]]. The delusion often involves their being influenced by a 'diabolical machine', just outside the technical understanding of the victim, that influences them from afar. It was typically believed to be operated by a group of people who were persecuting the individual, whom Tausk suggested were \"to the best of my knowledge, almost exclusively of the male sex\" and the persecutors, \"predominantly physicians by whom the patient has been treated\".\n\nThese delusions are known in contemporary psychiatry as '[[passivity delusion]]s' or '[[passivity phenomenon|passivity phenomena]]' and are listed among [[Kurt Schneider|Kurt Schneider's]] 'first rank' symptoms which are thought to be particularly diagnostic of schizophrenia, and still form some of the core diagnostic criteria.\n\n==Extract from the article==\n<blockquote>The schizophrenic influencing machine is a machine of mystical nature. The patients are able to give only vague hints of its construction. It consists of boxes, cranks, levers, wheels, buttons, wires, batteries, and the like. Patients endeavor to discover the construction of the apparatus by means of their technical knowledge, and it appears that with the progressive popularization of the sciences, all the forces known to technology are utilized to explain the functioning of the apparatus. All the discoveries of mankind, however, are regarded as inadequate to explain the marvelous powers of this machine, by which the patients feel themselves persecuted.\nThe main effects of the influencing machine are the following:\n\n# It makes the patient see pictures. When this is the case, the machine is generally a magic lantern or cinematograph. The pictures are seen on a single plane, on walls or windowpanes, and unlike typical visual hallucinations are not three-dimensional.\n# It produces, as well as removes, thoughts and feelings by means of waves or rays or mysterious forces which the patient's knowledge of physics is inadequate to explain. In such cases, the machine is often called a 'suggestion-apparatus.' Its construction cannot be explained, but its function consists in the transmission or 'draining off' of thoughts and feelings by one or several persecutors.\n# It produces motor phenomena in the body, erections and seminal emissions, that are intended to deprive the patient of his male potency and weaken him. This is accomplished either by means of suggestion or by air-currents, electricity, magnetism, or X-rays.\n# It creates sensations that in part cannot be described, because they are strange to the patient himself, and that in part are sensed as electrical, magnetic, or due to air-currents.\n# It is also responsible for other occurrences in the patient's body, such as cutaneous eruptions, abscesses, or other pathological processes.<\/blockquote>\n\n==The Influencing Machine in literature and film ==\nTausk's paper has been highly influential within both his own field of psychoanalysis and outside. It has in more recent years been used in literary theory to explain characters' de-centeredness from their surroundings and their psychical collapse into psychosis. Furthermore, the idea of a great alien machine taking over the human race has become a stock element of certain types of popular fiction.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n===Literature===\nThe most well-known example of the influencing machine delusion is that of [[James Tilly Matthews]] who believed he was being controlled \"body and mind\" by a device called the \"Air Loom.\"<ref name=\"Jay_2003\">Jay M. (2003) ''The Air Loom Gang''. Bantam Press. ISBN 0-593-04997-7<\/ref> Matthews was a tea merchant and political activist before he was admitted to the [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]] (Bedlam) after shouting \"treason\" in the [[British House of Commons]] in 1797. He was a prolific writer and artist and described the \"air loom\" in great detail. His descriptions were published as a book entitled ''[[Illustrations of Madness]]: Exhibiting a Singular Case of Insanity, And a No Less Remarkable Difference in Medical Opinions: Developing the Nature of An Assailment, And the Manner of Working Events; with a Description of Tortures Experienced by Bomb-Bursting, Lobster-Cracking and Lengthening the Brain. Embellished with a Curious Plate''.\n\nIn the novel ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'', the narrator, \"Chief\" Bromden, believes that the psychiatric ward in which he is committed (including the staff) is a machine in the service of a broader \"Combine,\" his name for technological society. This portrayal has been described as one of the best-known fictional examples of an \"influencing machine\" patient.<ref>Melley, Timothy (2000) ''Empire of Conspiracy''<\/ref>\n\n''[[Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television]]'' by [[Jerry Mander]] (1978).\nActivist Jerry Mander's book argues for the complete removal of television from our lives because of its ill effects. Mander gives the example of Tausk's \"Influencing machine\" as being a parallel for television: \"Doubtless you have noticed that this 'influencing machine' sounds an awful lot like television ... In any event, there is no question that television does what the schizophrenic fantasy says it does. It places in our minds images of reality which are outside our experience. The pictures come in the form of rays from a box. They cause changes in feeling and ... utter confusion as to what is real and what is not.\"\n\n==See also==\n===Cases===\n*[[John C.

He founded the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] in 1848 with [[William Holman Hunt]] and [[John Everett Millais]]. Rossetti was later to be the main inspiration for a second generation of artists and writers influenced by the movement, most notably [[William Morris]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]]. His work also influenced the European [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]]s and was a major precursor of the [[Aesthetic movement]].\n\nRossetti's art was characterised by its sensuality and its medieval revivalism. His early poetry was influenced by [[John Keats]]. His later poetry was characterised by the complex interlinking of thought and feeling, especially in his sonnet sequence, ''The House of Life''. Poetry and image are closely entwined in Rossetti's work. He frequently wrote [[sonnet]]s to accompany his pictures, spanning from ''The Girlhood of Mary Virgin'' (1849) and ''Astarte Syriaca'' (1877), while also creating art to illustrate poems such as \"[[Goblin Market]]\" by the celebrated poet [[Christina Rossetti]], his sister.\n\nRossetti's personal life was closely linked to his work, especially his relationships with his models and muses [[Elizabeth Siddal]], [[Fanny Cornforth]] and [[Jane Morris]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:rossetti selbst.jpg|left|thumb|Self-portrait, 1847]]\nThe son of \u00e9migr\u00e9 Italian scholar [[Gabriele Rossetti|Gabriele Pasquale Giuseppe Rossetti]] and his wife [[Frances Polidori]], Rossetti was born in [[London]], and named '''Gabriel Charles Dante Rossetti'''. His family and friends called him Gabriel, but in publications he put the name [[Dante]] first (in honour of [[Dante Alighieri]]). He was the brother of poet [[Christina Rossetti]], critic [[William Michael Rossetti]], and author [[Maria Francesca Rossetti]].<ref name=\"Treuherz15\">Treuherz et al. (2003), pp. 15\u201318.<\/ref> During his childhood, Rossetti was home educated and often read the [[Bible]], along with the works of [[Shakespeare]], [[Dickens]], [[Sir Walter Scott]] and [[Lord Byron]].<ref name=\"Dante Gabriel Rossetti\">{{cite web|title=Dante Gabriel Rossetti|url=http:\/\/www.poetryfoundation.org\/bio\/dante-gabriel-rossetti|website=Poetry Foundation|accessdate=15 June 2014}}<\/ref>\n\nThe young Rossetti is described as \"self-possessed, articulate, passionate and charismatic\"<ref name=\"Treuherz19\">Treuherz et al. (2003), p. 19.<\/ref> but also \"ardent, poetic and feckless\".<ref>Hilton (1970), p. 26.<\/ref> Like all his siblings, he aspired to be a poet and attended [[King's College School, Wimbledon|King's College School]], in its original location near the Strand. He also wished to be a painter, having shown a great interest in [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] [[Art of Italy|Italian art]]. He studied at [[Henry Sass]]'s Drawing Academy from 1841 to 1845 when he enrolled at the Antique School of the [[Royal Academy]], leaving in 1848. After leaving the Royal Academy, Rossetti studied under [[Ford Madox Brown]], with whom he retained a close relationship throughout his life.<ref name=\"Treuherz15\" \/>\n\nFollowing the exhibition of [[William Holman Hunt]]'s painting ''The Eve of St. Agnes'', Rossetti sought out Hunt's friendship. The painting illustrated a poem by the little-known [[John Keats]]. Rossetti's own poem, \"[[The Blessed Damozel]]\", was an imitation of Keats, and he believed Hunt might share his artistic and literary ideals. Together they developed the philosophy of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] which they founded along with [[John Everett Millais]].\n\n[[File:William Holman Hunt - Portrait of Dante Gabriel Rossetti at 22 years of Age - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of Dante Gabriel Rossetti at 22 years of Age'' by [[William Holman Hunt]]]]\nThe group's intention was to reform English art by rejecting what they considered to be the mechanistic approach first adopted by the [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] artists who succeeded [[Raphael]] and [[Michelangelo]] and the formal training regime introduced by Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]]. Their approach was to return to the abundant detail, intense colours, and complex compositions of [[Quattrocento]] Italian and Flemish art.<ref name=\"Treuherz22\">Treuherz et al. (2003), p. 22.<\/ref><ref>Hilton (1970), pp. 31\u201335.<\/ref> The eminent critic [[John Ruskin]] wrote:\n\n{{blockquote|Every Pre-Raphaelite landscape background is painted to the last touch, in the open air, from the thing itself. Every Pre-Raphaelite figure, however studied in expression, is a true portrait of some living person.<ref>Quoted in Marsh (1996), p. 21.<\/ref>}}\n\nFor the first issue of the brotherhood's magazine, ''The Germ'', published early in 1850, Rossetti contributed a poem, \"The Blessed Damozel\", and a story about a fictional early Italian artist inspired by a vision of a woman who bids him combine the human and the divine in his art.<ref>Marsh (1996), p. 21.<\/ref> Rossetti was always more interested in the medieval than in the modern side of the movement, working on translations of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] and other medieval Italian poets, and adopting the stylistic characteristics of the early Italians.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Beginnings===\n[[File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti - The Girlhood of Mary Virgin.jpg|thumb|''The Girlhood of Mary Virgin'' (1849).  (Models: the artist's mother for [[St. Anne]] and his sister Christina for [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|the Virgin]]).<ref name=\"Marsh16\">Marsh (1996), p. 16.<\/ref>]]\nRossetti's first major paintings in oil display the realist qualities of the early Pre-Raphaelite movement. His ''Girlhood of Mary Virgin'' (1849) and ''[[Ecce Ancilla Domini]]'' (1850) portray Mary as a teenage girl. [[William Bell Scott]] saw ''Girlhood'' in progress in Hunt's studio and remarked on young Rossetti's technique:\n\n{{blockquote|He was painting in oils with water-colour brushes, as thinly as in water-colour, on canvas which he had primed with white till the surface was a smooth as cardboard, and every tint remained transparent.  I saw at once that he was not an orthodox boy, but acting purely from the aesthetic motive.  The mixture of genius and dilettantism of both men shut me up for the moment, and whetted my curiosity.<ref>Marsh (1996), p. 17.<\/ref>}}\n\nStung by criticism of his second major painting, ''Ecce Ancilla Domini'', exhibited in 1850, and the \"increasingly hysterical critical reaction that greeted Pre-Raphaelitism\"<ref name=\"Treuherz22\" \/> that year, Rossetti turned to watercolours, which could be sold privately. Although his work subsequently won support from John Ruskin, Rossetti only rarely exhibited thereafter.<ref name=\"Treuherz22\" \/>\n\n===Dante and Medievalism===\nIn 1850, Rossetti met [[Elizabeth Siddal]], an important model for the Pre-Raphaelite painters. Over the next decade, she became his muse, his pupil, and his passion. They were married in 1860.<ref name=\"Treuherz33\">Treuherz et al. (2003), p. 33.<\/ref>\n\n[[File:Autumn Song, Dante Gabriel Rossetti.jpg|thumb|left|Original manuscript of \"Autumn Song\" by Rossetti, 1848, in the [[Ashley Library]]]]\nRossetti's incomplete picture ''[[Found (Rossetti)|Found]]'', begun in 1853 and unfinished at his death, was his only major modern-life subject. It depicted a prostitute, lifted from the street by a country drover who recognises his old sweetheart. However, Rossetti increasingly preferred symbolic and mythological images to realistic ones,<ref name=\"Treuherz19\">Treuherz et al. (2003), pp. 19, 24\u201325.<\/ref>\n\nFor many years, Rossetti worked on English translations of Italian poetry including [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[La Vita Nuova]]'' (published as ''The Early Italian Poets'' in 1861). These and [[Sir Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' inspired his art of the 1850s. He created a method of painting in watercolours, using thick pigments mixed with gum to give rich effects similar to medieval [[illuminated manuscript|illuminations]]. He also developed a novel drawing technique in pen-and-ink. His first published illustration was \"The Maids of Elfen-Mere\" (1855), for a poem by his friend [[William Allingham]], and he contributed two illustrations to Edward Moxon's 1857 edition of [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]'s ''Poems'' and illustrations for works by his sister [[Christina Rossetti]].<ref name=\"Treuherz175\">Treuherz et al.

His brother, [[William Michael Rossetti]] recorded that services began changing in the church since the start of the \"High Anglican movement\". Rev. William Dodsworth was responsible for these changes, including the addition of the [[Catholic]] practice of placing flowers and candles by the altar. Rossetti and his family, along with two of his colleagues (one of which cofounded the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]]) had also attended St. Andrew's on Wells Street, a [[High Anglican]] church. It is noted that the Anglo-Catholic revival very much affected Rossetti in the late 1840s and early 1850s. The spiritual expressions of his painting ''The Girlhood of Mary Virgin,'' finished in 1849, are evident of this claim. The painting's altar is decorated very similarly to that of a Catholic altar, proving his familiarity with the Anglo-Catholic revival. The subject of the painting, the Blessed Virgin, is sewing a red cloth, a significant part of the Oxford Movement that emphasized the embroidering of altar cloths by women.<ref name=\"West Virginia University Press\">{{cite book|last1=Bentley|first1=D.M.R.|title=Rossetti's \"Ave\" and Related Pictures|year=1977|publisher=West Virginia University Press|pages=21\u201335|edition=Vol. 15|accessdate=15 June 2014}}<\/ref> Oxford Reformers identified two major aspects to their movement, that \"the end of all religion must be communion with God,\" and \"that the Church was divinely instituted for the very purpose of bringing about this consummation.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=G.W.|title=John Wesley and the Anglo-Catholic Revival|url=http:\/\/anglicanhistory.org\/misc\/taylor_wesley.html|website=Project Canterbury|publisher=SPCK|accessdate=15 June 2014}}<\/ref>\n\nFrom the beginning of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]]'s formation in 1848, their pieces of art included subjects of noble or religious disposition.

(Model: Fanny Cornforth)]]\nAround 1860, Rossetti returned to oil painting, abandoning the dense medieval compositions of the 1850s in favour of powerful close-up images of women in flat pictorial spaces characterised by dense colour. These paintings became a major influence on the development of the European [[symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] movement.<ref name=\"Treuherz52\">Treuherz et al. (2003), pp. 52\u201354.<\/ref> In them, Rossetti's depiction of women became almost obsessively stylised. He portrayed his new lover [[Fanny Cornforth]] as the epitome of physical eroticism, whilst Jane Burden, the wife of his business partner William Morris, was glamorised as an ethereal goddess. \"As in Rossetti's previous reforms, the new kind of subject appeared in the context of a wholesale reconfiguration of the practice of painting, from the most basic level of materials and techniques up to the most abstract or conceptual level of the meanings and ideas that can be embodied in visual form.\"<ref name=\"Treuherz52\" \/>  These new works were based not on medievalism, but on the Italian High [[Renaissance]] artists of [[Venice]], [[Titian]] and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]].<ref name=\"Treuherz52\" \/><ref name=\"Treuherz64\">Treuherz et al.

Rossetti became increasingly depressed, and on the death of his beloved Lizzie, buried the bulk of his unpublished poems with her at [[Highgate Cemetery]], though he later had them dug up. He idealised her image as [[Dante]]'s Beatrice in a number of paintings, such as ''[[Beata Beatrix]]''.<ref name=\"Treuherz80\">Treuherz et al.

In September 1869, he acquired the first of two pet wombats, which he named \"Top\". It was brought to the dinner table and allowed to sleep in the large centrepiece during meals. Rossetti's fascination with exotic animals continued throughout his life, culminating in the purchase of a [[llama]] and a [[toucan]], which he dressed in a cowboy hat and was trained to ride the llama round the dining-table for his amusement.<ref>[http:\/\/www.nla.gov.au\/grants\/haroldwhite\/papers\/atrumble.html National Library of Australia.]<\/ref>\n\nRossetti maintained [[Fanny Cornforth]] (described delicately by William Allington as Rossetti's \"housekeeper\")<ref>Todd (2001), p. 109.<\/ref> in her own establishment nearby in Chelsea, and painted many voluptuous images of her between 1863 and 1865.<ref>Todd (2001), p. 113.<\/ref>\n\n[[File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti - La viuda romana (D\u00ees Manibus).jpg|thumb|Rossetti's ''The Roman Widow'' at [[Museo de Arte de Ponce]], Puerto Rico]]\nIn 1865, he discovered auburn-haired [[Alexa Wilding]], a dressmaker and would-be actress who was engaged to model for him on a full-time basis and sat for ''The Blessed Damozel'' and other paintings.<ref name=\"Todd116\">Todd (2001), p. 116.<\/ref> She sat for more of his finished works than any other model, but comparatively little is known about her due to the lack of any romantic connection with Rossetti. He spotted her one evening in the [[Strand, London|Strand]] in 1865 and was immediately struck by her beauty. She agreed to sit for him the following day, but failed to arrive. He spotted her again weeks later, jumped from the cab he was in and persuaded her to go straight to his studio. He paid her a weekly fee to sit for him exclusively, afraid that other artists might employ her.<ref>Dunn, ''Recollections of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and his circle'', ed. Mander, (1984) p. 46.<\/ref> They shared a lasting bond; after Rossetti's death Wilding was said to have travelled regularly to place a wreath on his grave.<ref>Spencer-Longhurst, ''The Blue Bower: Rossetti in the 1860s'' (2006).<\/ref>\n\nJane Morris, whom Rossetti had used as a model for the Oxford Union murals he painted with William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones in 1857, also sat for him during these years, she \"consumed and obsessed him in paint, poetry, and life\".<ref name=\"Todd116\" \/>  In 1869, Morris and Rossetti rented a country house, [[Kelmscott Manor]] at [[Kelmscott]], Oxfordshire, as a summer home, but it became a retreat for Rossetti and Jane Morris to have a long-lasting and complicated liaison. They spent summers there with the Morris's children, while Morris travelled to [[Iceland]] in 1871 and 1873.<ref>Todd (2001), pp. 123\u2013130.<\/ref>\n\n[[File:Henry Treffry Dunn Rossetti and Dunton at 16 Cheyne Walk.jpg|left|thumb|Rossetti reading proofs of ''Ballads and Sonnets'' at 16 [[Cheyne Walk]], by [[Henry Treffry Dunn]] (1882)]]\nDuring these years, Rossetti was prevailed upon by friends, in particular [[Charles Augustus Howell]], to exhume his poems from his wife's grave which he did, collating and publishing them in 1870 in the volume ''Poems by D. G. Rossetti''. They created controversy when they were attacked as the epitome of the [[Fleshly school|\"fleshly school of poetry\"]]. Their eroticism and sensuality caused offence. One poem, \"Nuptial Sleep\", described a couple falling asleep after sex. It was part of Rossetti's [[sonnet sequence]] ''The House of Life'', a complex series of poems tracing the physical and spiritual development of an intimate relationship. Rossetti described the sonnet form as a \"moment's monument\", implying that it sought to contain the feelings of a fleeting moment, and reflect on their meaning. ''The House of Life'' was a series of interacting monuments to these moments \u2013 an elaborate whole made from a [[mosaic]] of intensely described fragments. It was Rossetti's most substantial literary achievement. The collection included some translations, including his \"Ballad Of Dead Ladies\",<!-- http:\/\/www.bartleby.com\/246\/735.html, http:\/\/www.rossettiarchive.org\/docs\/1-1881.1stedn.rad.html#p279 --> an 1869 translation of [[Fran\u00e7ois Villon]]'s poem \"[[Ballade des dames du temps jadis]].  (The word \"[[wikt:yesteryear|yesteryear]]\" is credited to Rossetti as a neologism used for the first time in this translation.)\n\nIn 1881, Rossetti published a second volume of poems, ''Ballads and Sonnets'', which included the remaining sonnets from ''The House of Life'' sequence.\n\n==Decline and death==\n[[File:Alexa Wilding (1879) by Dante Gabriel Rossetti.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alexa Wilding]] (1879)]]\n\nThe savage reaction of critics to Rossetti's first collection of poetry contributed to a mental breakdown in June 1872, and although he joined Jane Morris at Kelmscott that September, he \"spent his days in a haze of [[chloral hydrate|chloral]] and whisky\".<ref name=\"Todd 2001, pp. 128-129\">Todd (2001), pp. 128\u2013129.<\/ref> The next summer he was much improved, and both [[Alexa Wilding]] and Jane sat for him at Kelmscott, where he created a soulful series of dream-like portraits.<ref name=\"Todd 2001, pp. 128-129\"\/> In 1874, Morris reorganised his decorative arts firm, cutting Rossetti out of the business, and the polite fiction that both men were in residence with Jane at Kelmscott could not be maintained. Rossetti abruptly left Kelmscott in July 1874 and never returned. Toward the end of his life, he sank into a morbid state, darkened by his [[drug addiction]] to chloral hydrate and increasing mental instability. He spent his last years as a recluse at Cheyne Walk.\n\nOn Easter Sunday, 1882, he died at the country house of a friend, where he had gone in a vain attempt to recover his health, which had been destroyed by chloral as his wife's had been destroyed by [[laudanum]]. He died of [[Bright's Disease]], a disease of the kidneys from which he had been suffering for some time. He had been housebound for some years on account of paralysis of the legs, though his chloral addiction is believed to have been a means of alleviating pain from a botched [[hydrocele]] removal. He had been suffering from alcohol psychosis for some time brought on by the excessive amounts of whisky he used to drown out the bitter taste of the chloral hydrate. He is buried at [[Birchington|Birchington-on-Sea]], Kent, England. His grave is visited by admirers of his life's work and achievements as seen by fresh flowers placed there regularly.\n\n==Collections and critical assessment==\n[[Image:Dante Gabriel Rossetti 001.jpg|thumb|[[Albumen print]] of Dante Gabriel Rossetti by Charles Lutwidge Dodgson ([[Lewis Carroll]]) (1863)]]\n\n[[Tate Britain]], [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery|Birmingham]], [[Manchester Art Gallery|Manchester]] and [[Salford Museum and Art Gallery|Salford]] Museum and Art Galleries all contain large collections of Rossetti's work; the latter was bequeathed a number of works following the death of [[L.

Lowry was president of the Newcastle-based 'Rossetti Society', which was founded in 1966.<ref>Rohde (2000). p. 396.<\/ref> Lowry's private collection of works was chiefly built around Rossetti's paintings and sketches of Lizzie Siddal and Jane Morris, and notable pieces included ''Pandora'', '' Proserpine'' and a drawing of [[Annie Miller]].\n\nIn an interview with [[Mervyn Levy]], Lowry explained his fascination with the Rossetti women in relation to his own work: \"I don't like his women at all, but they fascinate me, like a snake. That's why I always buy Rossetti whenever I can. His women are really rather horrible. It's like a friend of mine who says he hates my work, although it fascinates him.\"<ref name=\"Rohde p. 276\">Rohde (2000), p. 276.<\/ref> The friend Lowry referred to was businessman Monty Bloom, to whom he also explained his obsession with Rossetti's portraits: \"They are not real women.[...] They are dreams.[...] He used them for something in his mind caused by the death of his wife. I may be quite wrong there, but significantly they all came after the death of his wife.\"<ref name=\"Rohde p. 276\" \/>\n\n[[File:16 Cheyne Walk 03.JPG|thumb|Blue plaque at 16 Cheyne Walk]]\nThe popularity, frequent reproduction, and general availability of Rossetti's later paintings of women have led to this association with \"a morbid and languorous sensuality\".<ref name=\"Treuherz12\">Treuherz et al.

The Kingdom was spread over 1000&nbsp;km from Dilli to Calcutta in the years 1600-1800. In present era, Rudhrapur is a town in Deoria district in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. His Majesty Vishal Singh Sankrityan is the sole scion to the throne.\n\n==Background==\n'''Rudhrapur''' is a town and a [[nagar panchayat]] in [[Deoria district]] in the [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Previously known as Sathasi Raj in the era 1600-1900, was ruled by Rajput Dynasty of the east. \nThe Sankrityan Royal Family was the ruling house of the Indian princely state of Awadh. They lost their ruling rights in 1935 when Awadh merged with the Indian Union and their privileges were abolished by the Indian Union in 1971 by a constitutional amendment. The family descends from the [[Rajput]] of [[Mewar]] and [[Ratlam]], and holds the distinction of being Kshatriya and Rajputs. The Royalty are also descendants of the Pandya and Chola dynasties as well, due to consistent intermarriages between the Sankri, Pandya, Srinet and Kolathiri dynasties over the centuries.[1] At present, Sree Vishalankrityan is the only scion to the throne. The Royal family is alternatively known as the Pandya, Pandey, Sankri, Sankrityan, Swaroopam, Singh, Rajput, Shrinet etc. It has its seat today at Rudhrapur in UP, India. The last ruling Maharajah of Sathasi was Sree Jai Singh, died on 20 July 1931 after a stroke. Srimati Savitri Singh Sankri, the only surviving daughter of the last ruling monarch of the Kingdom of Sathasi, Maharajah Jai Singh, died at a private hospital in the early hours on 16 December 2008. She was succeeded by her grandson Vishal Singh Sakrityan Pandey, son of Maharani Sheela Lakshmi Bayi and R. Shyam Pandey Raja after the rejection of the throne by R. Shyam Raja.\n\n==Recorded history of the dynasty==\n\nAccording to one existing version, the founding members of the Sathasi royal family<ref name=hindu>{{cite news|last=Singh|first=KAUSAL|title=Royal vignettes: Travancore - Simplicity graces this House|url=http:\/\/www.hindu.com\/mag\/2003\/03\/30\/stories\/2003033000700700.htm|accessdate=11 January 2012|newspaper=The Hindu|date=30 March 2003|location=Chennai, India}}<\/ref> are said to have come to Awadh, from the banks of the [[Rapti]] river. Another belief is that [[Parashurama]] himself crowned the first official ruler in the dynasty. Officially, their lineage can be traced definitively to at least 820 C.E, which is based on the claim of descent from the Later Pandya dynasty of the three [[northern India]]n ''Mandala'' Kingdoms namely ''Sankri Mandalam'', ''[[Pandya]] Mandalam'' and ''[[Chola]] Mandalam''. According to another legend, a branch of the Pandya family was sent to the extreme north of the region, where they settled and came to be known as the ''Sathasi'' Royal family, or the later [[Srineth]]s, while another branch was deputed to go south to grapple with the [[Pandya]]n invasions. During the British invasion, the family lost five of its descendants and eventually surrendered with certain terms of agreement for survival of the dynasty.\n\n==Modern Era==\n\nThe Maharajah (Emperor) system was abolished by Indian Constitution in 1971 with some acceptable privileges such as diplomatic immunity and Royal status to every direct descendants to the family. The privileges given to the Royal Family has been a major topic of controversy in recent years.<ref>http:\/\/ww.itimes.com\/photo\/secrets-of-indian-royal-families-maharaja-of-mysore<\/ref> Current Maharajah of the Kingdom has been living in the Delhi since the birth under his parent's Raja R. Shyam's and Rani Sheela's supervision. The family still owns the major part of the kingdom and it is a main source of revenue for the development of the area. His Highness Vishalankrityan also known as Vishal Sankrityan Pandey is currently pursuing higher studies abroad. His Majesty and the royal family is responsible for the education and infrastructure of the kingdom.\n\n==Titles and styles==\n{{infobox hrhstyles|\nroyal name=Maharajah Vishalankrityan of Sathasi Raj|\nimage=[[Image:Japanese Crest of Takamado no miya.svg|centre|Takamado no miya mon|120px]]|\ndipstyle=His Majesty|\noffstyle=Your Majesty|\naltstyle=Sir|\n}}\n\nVishal is styled as \"His Majesty Maharajah Vishal of Sathasi Raj\".\n\n==Present Royal Family & Current Title==\nHM Vishal is the sole scion to the royal family as per latest information. HM is still unmarried and is pursuing higher studies in Camosun College, Canada. His Majesty attended prestigious [[Woodstock School]] for his primary, junior high, and high school education. While he was a student at [[University of Delhi]], in 2010, he visited [[Goethe University]] in [[Germany]] under a school-sponsored exchange program. In April 2012, he enrolled in the [[Edinburgh New Town Cookery School]], for a Professional Chef Accredition Course .\nIn 2013 his majesty enrolled in [[Camosun College]] in [[Victoria, British Columbia]], Canada, to pursue higher studies in Marketing. His Majesty tries to pursue a simple and anonymous life and limits his public appearances to only events and ceremonies.\n\nHe continues to attend ceremonies and functions at the kingdom when studies permit.\n\n==Controversy==\n\nGiven that royalty was abolished by Indian Constitution in 1971, the family has been subject to many controversies in regards to their special privileges and political relationships. His Majesty's father Raja Sree R. Shyam has been subject to investigation for [[Black Money]] in [[Swiss Bank Accounts]]. Royal family's connection to the political parties and active involvement of his majesty's father in the government has given rise to various issues. In the past, the family faced a major public protest when Maharani Savitri married a Greek national named Agafaya Lampo in the year 1960 while pursuing her studies at [[Oxford University]] [[London]], as she was the only daughter of the Maharajah and the dynasty was at risk of disappearing.\n\n==References==\n* History [http:\/\/www.onlinerudrapur.com OnlineRudrapur.com]\n* Royal Families [http:\/\/www.royalfamilyofindia.com\/]\n* Lavish lifestyle [http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/magazine-31709924]\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http:\/\/www.onlinerudrapur.com OnlineRudrapur.com]\n* [http:\/\/www.rudrapuronline.com Business guide to Rudrapur]\n* [http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/magazine-31709924]\n\n<!-- STOP!

Johnson first recorded the song in December 1930, although [[Delta blues]] musician [[Charley Patton]] recorded a similar \"You're Gonna Need Somebody When You Die\" in October 1929.  Over the years, several other musicians have recorded renditions of the song.\n\n==Blind Willie Johnson==\nThe lyrics of \"You'll Need Somebody on Your Bond\" deal with \"the idea that we will all need a legally binding guarantee to gain access to heaven\" and that Jesus as our advocate \"will provide us with a guarantee or bond, if we follow His ways\".<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last = Blakey\n| first = D.

As with many of his songs, \"You'll Need Somebody on Your Bond\" is performed with Johnson on lead vocals and [[slide guitar]] and an unknown female singer accompanying him on vocals.  While it was first believed that his wife Angeline Johnson provided those backing vocals, it has since been refuted by Johnson's lead biographer.  The second version, titled \"You're Gonna Need Somebody on Your Bond\" is nearly identical to the first, with slightly more subdued vocals and backing vocal provided by Willie B. Harris, sometimes considered to be Johnson's first wife.<ref name=\"Charters\">\n{{cite AV media notes\n| title = The Complete Blind Willie Johnson\n| others = [[Blind Willie Johnson]]\n| year = 1993\n| last = Charters\n| first = Samuel\n| authorlink = Samuel Charters\n| type = CD booklet\n| publisher = Columbia\/Legacy\n| id = C2K 52835\n| pages = 22, 25\u201326\n}}<\/ref>\n\nJohnson recorded the first version of the song for [[Columbia Records]] as \"You'll Need Somebody on Your Bond\" on December 11, 1929, in New Orleans, Louisiana.  He later recorded a second version titled \"You're Gonna Need Somebody on Your Bond\" on April 20, 1930, in Atlanta, Georgia, which was Johnson's last recorded song.<ref name=\"Charters\"\/>  The songs aappear on several Johnson compilation albums \u2013 both are included on ''The Complete Blind Willie Johnson'' (1993), while the second version is found on ''[[The Soul of a Man (album)|The Soul of a Man]]'' (2003).\n\n==Buffy Sainte-Marie version==\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Buffy Sainte-Marie-Its My Way.jpg|left|thumbnail|200px|Buffy Sainte-Marie's version was first released on ''It's My Way!'' in 1964.]] -->\nIn 1964, [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]] recorded \"You're Gonna Need Somebody on Your Bond\" with slightly altered lyrics and included the song on her debut album, ''[[It's My Way!]]''.  While her debut album did not chart, it proved influential to both the American and British folk communities.  Sainte-Marie recorded the song on acoustic guitar without using a slide and sang without any backup vocals.\n\n==Donovan version==\n{{Infobox single |\n| Name = You're Gonna Need Somebody on Your Bond\n| Artist = [[Donovan]]\n| Album = [[What's Bin Did and What's Bin Hid]]\n| B-side = \"The Little Tin Soldier\"\n| Released = {{Start date|1965|11}} <small>(US)<\/small>|\n| Format = [[Gramophone record#Formats|7\" 45&nbsp;rpm record]]|\n| Recorded = 1965\n| Genre = [[Folk music|Folk]]\n| Length = {{Duration|m=4|s=04}}\n| Label  = [[Hickory Records|Hickory]] <small>(45-1375)<\/small>\n| Producer = Terry Kennedy, Peter Eden, Geoff Stephens\n| Chronology = [[Donovan]] USA singles\n| Last single = \"[[Universal Soldier (song)|Universal Soldier]]\"<br \/>(1965)\n| This single = \"'''You're Gonna Need Somebody on Your Bond'''\"<br \/>(1965)\n| Next single = \"[[To Try for the Sun]]\"<br \/>(1966)\n}}\nScottish singer-songwriter [[Donovan]] recorded \"You're Gonna Need Somebody on Your Bond\" in early 1965 for inclusion on his debut album ''[[What's Bin Did and What's Bin Hid]]''.  Since Donovan recorded a version of \"[[Universal Soldier (song)|Universal Soldier]]\" after hearing it on [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]]'s [[It's My Way!|debut album]], it is likely that he first heard \"You're Gonna Need Somebody on Your Bond\" from the same source.  Hickory Records released \"You're Gonna Need Somebody on Your Bond\" backed with a cover of \"The Little Tin Soldier\" by [[Shawn Phillips]] in November 1965 (Hickory 45-1375), but it did not appear in the single charts.\n\n==Other recordings==\n[[Captain Beefheart]] frequently included \"You'll Need Somebody On Your Bond\" in the set list of his early shows. In addition, he drew on the song for \"Tarotplane\", the opening track of his 1971-released album, ''[[Mirror Man (Captain Beefheart album)|Mirror Man]]''.  [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] covered \"You're Gonna Need Someone On Your Bond\" on his 1969 album ''[[Giant Step\/De Ole Folks at Home]]''.  [[The Drones (Australian band)|The Drones]] covered the song under the title \"Someone On Your Bond\", which was included on ''[[The Miller's Daughter (album)|The Miller's Daughter]]'', a 2005 collection of outtakes.  Under the name \"You're Gonna Need Somebody on Your Bond\", [[the Deviants (band)|the Deviants]] included this song on their final studio album (or at least the last one released before the death of bandleader [[Mick Farren]]), ''[[Dr. Crow]]'' (2002).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Donovan}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:You'll Need Somebody On Your Bond}}\n[[Category:1929 songs]]\n[[Category:Blind Willie Johnson songs]]\n[[Category:Gospel songs]]\n[[Category:Blues songs]]\n[[Category:Donovan songs]]\n[[Category:Buffy Sainte-Marie songs]]\n[[Category:Taj Mahal (musician) songs]]","timestamp":"20160410100302","user-timestamp":"20150410100302"},{"title":"User:Qrwa Sobkowska","content":"Please contact me in English","timestamp":"20160410100302","user-timestamp":"20150410100302"},{"title":"Jointed rush","content":"'''Jointed rush''' is a common name for several plants in the genus ''[[Juncus]]'' and may refer to:\n\n*''[[Juncus articulatus]]'', native to the Northern hemisphere, commonly known as \"jointed rush\" in the United Kingdom\n*''[[Juncus kraussii]]'', native to the Southern hemisphere, commonly known as \"jointed rush\" in Australia\n\n{{Plant common name}}","timestamp":"20160410100303","user-timestamp":"20150410100303"},{"title":"User talk:CFluvskikx106","content":"Hey looking up some stuff bou the Grand Canyon and the Layers Of the Earth!

It is commonly played by 4 players (with some 3-player variations found in [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]]).  The game and its regional variants are widely played throughout Eastern and South Eastern Asia and have a small following in Western countries. Similar to the Western card game [[rummy]], Mahjong is a [[game of skill]], strategy, and calculation and involves a degree of chance.\n\nThe game is played with a set of 144 [[Mahjong tiles|tiles]] based on [[Chinese characters]] and [[chinese culture|symbols]], although some regional variations use a different number of tiles. In most variations, each player begins by receiving 13 tiles. In turn players draw and discard tiles until they complete a legal hand using the 14th drawn tile to form 4 groups ([[#Melds|melds]]) and a pair (head). There are fairly standard rules about how a piece is drawn, how a piece is stolen from another player and thus melded, the use of simples (numbered tiles) and honors (winds and dragons), the kinds of melds, and the order of dealing and play. However, there are many regional variations in the rules; in addition, the scoring system and the minimum hand necessary to win varies significantly based on the local rules being used.\n\n== Name ==\nIn Chinese, the game was originally called \u9ebb\u96c0 ({{zh|hp=m\u00e1qu\u00e8}}){{mdash}}meaning [[sparrow]]{{mdash}}which is still the name most commonly used in some southern [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]] such as [[Cantonese]] and [[Min Nan]], as well as in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. However, most Mandarin-speaking Chinese now call the game ''m\u00e1ji\u00e0ng'' (\u9ebb\u5c07).  In [[Taihu Wu dialects|Northern]] [[Wu Chinese]] ([[Shanghainese]] and its relatives), it is pronounced as \u9ebb\u5c07 {{IPA-wuu|mo tsia\u014b|}}, but in actuality, \u9ebb\u5c07 is the diminutive form of \u9ebb\u96c0, written as \u9ebb\u96c0\u5152 {{IPA-wuu|mo tsia\u0294 \u014b|}}, due to an [[erhua]] event. It is through the Wu Chinese pronunciation of \u9ebb\u96c0\u5152 that the diminutive form of \u9ebb\u96c0 in Northern Wu became known as \u9ebb\u5c07 in both Mandarin and Wu.{{Citation needed|reason=No cited reference at all in this section|date=June 2013}}\n\n== History ==\n\n=== China ===\n[[File:\u6cad\u967d\u7d19\u724c.png|thumb|Money-suited cards]]\nMahjong is based on draw-and-discard [[card games]] that were popular in 18th and 19th century China and some are still popular today.<ref name=Lo>{{cite book|last1=Lo|first1=Andrew|title=\u2018China\u2019s Passion for Pai: Playing Cards, Dominoes, and Mahjong\u2019.

In addition, there are 3 [[Wild card (card games)|wild cards]]: '''Red flower''', '''White flower''', and '''Old thousand'''. Depending on the game, there are multiple copies of each card.\n\nGames scholar [[David Parlett]] has written that the Western card games [[Conquian]] and [[Rummy]] share a common origin with Mahjong.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parlett|first=David|title=The Penguin Book of Card Games|year=1978|isbn=978-0-14-103787-5}}<\/ref> All these games involve players drawing and discarding tiles or cards to make [[Meld (cards)|melds]].

The earliest surviving tile sets date to around 1870 and were acquired in [[Fuzhou]], [[Shanghai]], and [[Ningbo]].<ref name=Lo \/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Stanwick|first1=Michael|title=\u2018Mahjong(g) Before Mahjong(g): Part 1\u2019|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=2004|volume=32|issue=4|pages=153\u2013162}}<\/ref><ref>Sloper, Tom.

There were also \"king\" tiles for the each of the 4 \"winds\". In the contemporaneous Himly set, there were no ''zh\u014dng'' (\"red dragon\") tiles too. Instead there were the Cash Flower, String Flower, and Myriad Flower plus an additional king tile, the king of everything. The function of the king tiles are uncertain, they may have acted as wild cards.

It became a success in [[Washington, D.C.]], and the co-owner of the company, [[Ezra Fitch]], sent emissaries to Chinese villages to buy every Mahjong set they could find. Abercrombie & Fitch sold a total of 12,000 Mahjong sets.\n\nAlso in 1920, [[Joseph Park Babcock]] published his book ''Rules of Mah-Jongg'', also known as the \"red book\". This was the earliest version of Mahjong known in America. Babcock had learned Mahjong while living in China. His rules simplified the game to make it easier for Americans to take up, and his version was common through the Mahjong fad of the 1920s. Later, when the 1920s fad died out, many of Babcock's simplifications were abandoned.\n\nThe game has taken on a number of trademarked names, such as \"Pung Chow\" and the \"Game of Thousand Intelligences\". Mahjong nights in America often involved dressing and decorating rooms in Chinese style.<ref>[[Bill Bryson]], ''[[Made in America (book)|Made in America]]''. Harper, 1996, ch. 16.<\/ref> Several hit songs were recorded during the Mahjong fad, most notably \"Since Ma Is Playing Mah Jong\" by [[Eddie Cantor]].<ref name=slope\/>\n\nMany variants of Mahjong developed during this period. By the 1930s, many revisions of the rules developed that were substantially different from Babcock's classical version (including some that were considered fundamentals in other variants, such as the notion of a standard hand). The most common form, which eventually became \"American Mahjong\", was most popular among [[American Jews|Jewish]] women.<ref name=slope\/> Standardization came with the formation of the National Mah Jongg League (NMJL) in 1937, along with the first American Mahjong rulebook, ''Maajh: The American Version of the Ancient Chinese Game, written by NMJL's first president and co-founder, Viola L. Cecil.<ref>Tom Sloper, ''The Red Dragon & The West Wind: The Winning Guide to Official Chinese & American Mah-Jongg'', HarperCollins, 2007.''<\/ref>\n\nMany consider the modern American version a remake of a Jewish game,<ref name=slope>{{cite web |url=http:\/\/www.sloperama.com\/mjfaq\/mjfaq19.html#t |title=Why are so many players of American mah-jongg Jewish? |publisher=Sloperama.com |date= |accessdate=7 September 2012}}<\/ref> as many American Mahjong players are of Jewish descent. The NMJL was founded by Jewish players and is considered a Jewish organization. In 1986, the National Mah Jongg League conducted their first Mah Jongg Cruise Tournament, in conjunction with Mah Jongg Madness. In 2010, this large scale seagoing event hosted its 25th Silver Anniversary Cruise, with players from all over the States and Canada participating.\n\nIn recent years, a second organization has formed, the American Mah Jongg Association. The AMJA currently hosts tournaments all across North America, with their signature event being at the [[Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort]] in [[Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]].\n\nBritish author Alan D. Millington revived the Chinese classical game of the 1920s with his book ''The Complete Book of Mah-jongg'' (1977). This handbook includes a formal rules set for the game.\n\n=== Current development ===\nThere are many governing bodies which often host exhibition games and tournaments for modern and traditional Mahjong gaming.\n\nMahjong, as of 2010, is the most popular table game in Japan.<ref>Pakarnian, John, \"Game Boy:  Glossary of Japanese Gambling Games\", ''[[Metropolis (free magazine)|Metropolis]]'', 22 January 2010, p. 15.<\/ref> As of 2008, there were approximately 7.6 million Mahjong players in Japan and an estimated 8,900 Mahjong parlors did \u00a5300 billion in sales.<ref>Matsutani, Minoru, \"[http:\/\/search.japantimes.co.jp\/cgi-bin\/nn20100615i1.html Mah-jongg ancient, progressive]\", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 15 June 2010, p. 3.<\/ref> Many devotees there believe the game is losing popularity and have taken efforts to revive it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} There are several [[manga]] and [[anime]] (e.g. [[Saki (manga)|Saki]] and [[Akagi (manga)|Akagi]]) devoted to dramatic and comic situations involving Mahjong.<ref>Schodt, Frederik, ''Manga!

Newer units can connect with other arcade machines across the Internet.\n\n[[Mahjong culture]] is still deeply ingrained in the Chinese community. [[Sam Hui]] wrote [[Cantopop|Cantopop songs]] using Mahjong as their themes, and [[Hong Kong]] movies have often included scenes of Mahjong games. Many gambling movies have been filmed in Hong Kong, and a recent subgenre is the [[Mahjong movie]].\n\nProlonged playing of Mahjong may trigger [[epilepsy|epileptic seizures]] according to a 2007 study.<ref>{{citation | title = Mah-jong\u2013induced seizures: case reports and review of twenty-three patients | url = http:\/\/www.hkmj.org\/article_pdfs\/hkm0708p314.pdf | author = Richard S.K.

This form of Mahjong starts with a large portion of the standardized tiles and has a relatively simple scoring system.\n\n=== Game Pieces and Accessories ===\n{{Main|Mahjong tiles}}\n[[File:Majiang2.JPG|thumb|upright|A set of Mahjong tiles and accessories]]\n\nHong Kong Mahjong is played with a set of Mahjong tiles (though cards may be used). Sets often include counters (to keep score), dice (to decide how to deal) and a marker to show who the dealer is and which round is being played. Some sets include racks to the hold tiles. Especially if they are larger\/smaller than standard tiles or have an odd shape.\n\nA set of Mahjong tiles usually has at least 136 tiles (most commonly 144). Although, sets originating from America or Japan will probably have more. Mahjong tiles are split into 4 categories: Suits (or simples), Honors, Flowers and Seasons.<ref name=\"Tile set description - Mahjong\">{{Cite web|title = Tile set description - Mahjong|url = https:\/\/www.mahjongg4u.com\/help\/tileset|website = www.mahjongg4u.com|access-date = 2016-02-19}}<\/ref>\n\n==== Suits tiles ====\nThere are 3 different groups of suits, numbered from 1 to 9, which are also called \"simple\" tiles. They are: bamboos (also called bams or sticks), stones (also called wheels, circles or dots), and characters (also called numbers, thousands, coins, characks, myriads, cracks or wan) There are 4 identical copies of each suit tile totaling 108 suit or \"simple\" tiles.<ref name=\"Tile set description - Mahjong\"\/><ref name=\"Your Guide to Mahjong Tiles\">{{Cite web|title = Your Guide to Mahjong Tiles|url = http:\/\/chineseculture.about.com\/od\/chinesefestivals\/tp\/Mahjong-Explanation-Of-Mahjong-Tiles.htm|website = About.com News & Issues|access-date = 2016-02-19}}<\/ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|\n!colspan=9|Numbers\n|-\n!Suit\n!1\n!2\n!3\n!4\n!5\n!6\n!7\n!8\n!9\n|-\n|Bamboos\n|[[File:MJs1.png]]\n|[[File:MJs2.png]]\n|[[File:MJs3.png]]\n|[[File:MJs4.png]]\n|[[File:MJs5.png]]\n|[[File:MJs6.png]]\n|[[File:MJs7.png]]\n|[[File:MJs8.png]]\n|[[File:MJs9.png]]\n|-m\n|Stones\n|[[File:MJt1.png]]\n|[[File:MJt2.png]]\n|[[File:MJt3.png]]\n|[[File:MJt4.png]]\n|[[File:MJt5.png]]\n|[[File:MJt6.png]]\n|[[File:MJt7.png]]\n|[[File:MJt8.png]]\n|[[File:MJt9.png]]\n|-\n|Characters\n|[[File:MJw1.png]]\n|[[File:MJw2.png]]\n|[[File:MJw3.png]]\n|[[File:MJw4.png]]\n|[[File:MJw5.png]]\n|[[File:MJw6.png]]\n|[[File:MJw7.png]]\n|[[File:MJw8.png]]\n|[[File:MJw9.png]]\n|}\n\n==== Honors tiles ====\nThere are 2 different sets of Honors tiles: Winds and Dragons (also called Arrows). The Winds are East, South, West and North. The Dragons are Red, Green and White. The characters ([[hanzi]]) on these tiles each have multiple meanings. The red character \u4e2d (''zh\u014dng'', center) represents \u7d05\u4e2d (''h\u00f3ng zh\u014dng'') which means passing the imperial exam, a sign for a hit in archery, or the Confucian virtue of [[Ren (Confucianism)|benevolence]]. The green character \u767c (''f\u0101'', wealth) represents \u767c\u8ca1 (''f\u0101 c\u00e1i'', get rich), an archery marking that signals an archer to release their draw (shoot the arrow they have drawn), or the Confucian virtue of [[sincerity]]. The blue character \u767d (''b\u00e1i'', white) character represents \u767d\u677f (''b\u00e1i ban'', white board) which means freedom from corruption, a missed shot in archery, or the Confucian virtue of [[filial piety]] (the act of honoring the spirit of your family and ancestors). These tiles have no numerical sequence and each Honors tile has 4 copies in a standard Mahjong set.[http:\/\/chineseculture.about.com\/od\/chinesefestivals\/tp\/Mahjong-Explanation-Of-Mahjong-Tiles.htm]\n\n(i.e. 4 Green Dragon tiles and 4 East Wind tiles)\n\n{| width=\"100%\" border=\"0\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|width=\"25%\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Winds\n!Name\n!Sign\n|-\n| East\n|[[File:MJf1.png]]\n|-\n| South\n|[[File:MJf2.png]]\n|-\n|West\n|[[File:MJf3.png]]\n|-\n|North\n|[[File:MJf4.png]]\n|}\n|width=\"25%\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Dragons\n!Name\n!Sign\n|-\n|Red\n|[[File:MJd1.png]]\n|-\n|Green\n|[[File:MJd2.png]]\n|-\n|White\n|[[File:MJd3.png]]\n|}\n|}\n\n==== Bonus tiles ====\nThere are 2 sets of bonus tiles: Flowers and Seasons. The flower and season tiles are unique in the fact that each one has a different artistic rendering of a specific type of flower or season and that each design has only one tile in the whole set making a total of 4 flower tiles and 4 season tiles altogether. These tiles are not drawn into a player's hand but are set aside (kept near the player's other tiles for scoring purposes should they win the hand) when drawn and an extra tile is drawn in replacement of the bonus tile.<ref name=\"Your Guide to Mahjong Tiles\"\/>\n\n{| border=\"0\" width=\"100%\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| width=\"25%\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Flowers\n!Flower\n!Sign\n|-\n|Plum\n|[[File:MJh5.png]]\n|-\n|Orchid\n|[[File:MJh6.png]]\n|-\n|Chrysanthemum\n|[[File:MJh7.png]]\n|-\n|Bamboo\n|[[File:MJh8.png]]\n|}\n| width=\"25%\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Seasons\n!Season\n!Sign\n|-\n|Spring\n|[[File:MJh1.png]]\n|-\n|Summer\n|[[File:MJh2.png]]\n|-\n|Autumn\n|[[File:MJh3.png]]\n|-\n|Winter\n|[[File:MJh4.png]]\n|}\n|}\n\n=== Choosing table positions and first dealer ===\nThe dealer is chosen by various means, either by throwing dice (the highest total takes the east wind), by placing one of each wind face down and having each player randomly select one of these tiles or other house rule variations. Each player sits down at their respective position (called the wind position) at the table in positions of an inverted compass: East is dealer, the right of the dealer is South, across is West and the left is North. The order essentially is counter-clockwise.\n\n=== Hands, rounds, and matches ===\nA match consists of 4 rounds, each representing a \"prevailing wind,\" starting with East. Once the first round is completed, a second round begins with South as the prevailing wind, and so on. Wind position is significant in that it affects the scoring of the game. A Mahjong set with Winds in play will usually include a separate prevailing wind marker (typically a die marked with the Wind characters in a holder).\n\nIn each round at least 4 hands are played, with each player taking the position of dealer. In the first hand of each round, player 1 (winner of the dice toss) is East and therefore dealer. In the second hand player 2 takes the East position, shifting the seat winds amongst the players counterclockwise (though players don't physically move their chairs). This continues until all 4 players have been East (dealer). A marker is used to mark which player is East and often the round number. (In sets with racks, a rack may be marked differently to denote the dealer.)\n\nWhenever a player in the East position (dealer) wins a hand, or if there is no winner (a draw or \"goulash hand\"), an extra hand is played with the same seating positions and prevailing wind as in the previous hand. This means that a match may potentially have no limit to the number of hands played (though some players will set a limit of 3 consecutive hands allowed with the same seat positions and prevailing wind).\n\nExample of Games:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Example of a standard 16 hand game with 2 extra hands played per no-winner-hand (goulash) and per east winning hand.\n!

By convention all players should participate in shuffling using both hands moving the pieces around the table, loudly, for a lengthy period. There is no fixed rule on how to deal or how to treat tiles which flip over during shuffle, though possible solutions include turning back over the pieces at the moment they are seen, turning over all revealed pieces at intervals or doing so at the end of the shuffling and forming of the wall.\n\nEach player then stacks a row of 18 tiles 2 tiles high in front of them (for a total of 36 tiles). Players then push each side of their tiles together to form a square wall.\n\nThe dealer throws 3 dice and sums up the total. Counting counterclockwise so that the dealer is 1 (or 5, 9, 13, 17), so that south is 2 (or 6, 10, 14, 18), etc., a player's quarter of the wall is chosen. Using the same total on the dice, the player then counts the stacks of tiles from right to left. Starting from the left of the stacks counted, the dealer takes 4 tiles to himself, and players in counterclockwise order take blocks of 4 tiles until all players have 12 tiles, so that the stacks decrease clockwise. Each player then takes one last tile to make a 13-tile hand. Dealing does not have to be this formal and may be done quite differently based on house rules.\n\nEach player now sets aside any Flowers or Seasons they may have drawn and takes replacement piece(s) from the wall.\n\nThe dealer takes the next piece from the wall, adds it to his hand. If this does not complete a legal hand, he then discards a piece (throwing it into the middle of the wall with no particular order in mind).\n\n=== Rules ===\n[[File:Lanzhou-019.JPG|right|thumb|Local play on the street in [[Lanzhou]] ]]\n\nEach player takes a turn picking up a tile from the wall and then discarding a tile by throwing it into the center and, if desired, announcing out loud what the piece is. Play continues this way until one player has a legal winning hand and calls out Mahjong while revealing their hand. There are 4 different ways that this order of play can be interrupted.\n\nDuring play, the number of tiles maintained by each player should always be thirteen tiles (meaning in each turn a tile must be picked up and another discarded). Not included in the count of thirteen tiles are Flowers and Seasons set to the side and the 4th added piece of a Kong. If a player is seen to have more or less than thirteen tiles in their hand outside of their turn they are penalised.\n\n==== Legal hand ====\nA winning hand consists of 14 tiles (the thirteen tiles in the hand plus the additional tile picked up from the wall or stolen when a player discards a tile needed to complete a hand). The first is called winning from the wall, the second is called winning by a discard.\n\nThe winning hand is made of 4 melds (a specific pattern of 3 pieces) and the eyes (a pair of 2 identical pieces). The exception to this rule are the special hands listed below.\n\nMost players play with a table minimum, meaning a winning hand must score a minimum number of points (which can be seen in the scoring section). In Hong Kong Mahjong the most common point set is 3.\n\n==== Melds ====\n* '''Pong''' (Chinese: \u78b0, Japanese: \u30dd\u30f3) is a set of 3 identical tiles. For example:\n\n[[File:MJt9.png|25px|9 Stone]] [[File:MJt9.png|25px|9 Stone]] [[File:MJt9.png|25px|9 Stone]]\n\n[[File:MJs3.png|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3.png|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3.png|25px|3 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJf2.png|25px|South Wind]] [[File:MJf2.png|25px|South Wind]] [[File:MJf2.png|25px|South Wind]]\n\n[[File:MJd2.png|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2.png|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2.png|25px|Green Dragon]]\n\nYou may form a Pong with any tile (except Flowers or Seasons because they are bonus tiles which are set aside and there are not 3 identical bonus tiles). The tiles must be identical (you cannot mix suits).\n* '''Kong''' (Chinese: \u69d3, Japanese: \u30ab\u30f3) is a set of 4 identical tiles. For example:\n\n[[File:MJd1.png|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1.png|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1.png|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1.png|25px|Red Dragon]]\n\n[[File:MJs7.png|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs7.png|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs7.png|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs7.png|25px|7 Bamboo]]\n\nConsider a Kong the same as a Pong\/ Pung with an additional tile to make a set of 4. There are 3 ways to form a Kong.\n* Before discarding a player who has all 4 matching tiles in their hand may declare a Kong. They do so by revealing the meld and placing 2 pieces in the middle face up and 2 pieces on the ends face down. This is called a concealed or hidden Kong (Chinese: \u6697\u69d3, Japanese: \u30a2\u30f3\u30ab\u30f3).\n* If a player can use a discarded tile to compliment 3 matching tiles in their hand, they can take the piece and reveal a \"Kong by discard\" or \"melded Kong\". The player reveals his 3 pieces face up and places the stolen discard on top of the middle tile.\n* If a player has already stolen (melded) a piece to make a Pong and then later in the game draws the 4th piece from the wall, he or she may announce (then or later in the game) a Kong by placing the 4th tile on top of the middle piece of the melded Pong. If a Pong has been melded a player cannot steal the 4th piece if another player discards it.\n\nWhenever a Kong is formed, that player must draw an extra tile from the end of the wall and then discard a tile. The 4th piece of the Kong (not Flowers\/Seasons) is not considered as one of the 13 tiles a player must always have in their hand. Kongs are worth collecting to score more points and\/or deprive opponents of obtaining specific tiles.\n* '''Chow''' (Chinese: \u5403 (Mandarin, Minnan)\/\u4e0a (Cantonese), Japanese: \u30c1\u30fc) is a meld of 3 suited tiles in sequence. For example:\n\n[[File:MJs1.png|25px|1 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs2.png|25px|2 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3.png|25px|3 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJs3.png|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs4.png|25px|4 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs5.png|25px|5 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJs7.png|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs8.png|25px|8 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs9.png|25px|9 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJt5.png|25px|5 Circle]] [[File:MJt6.png|25px|6 Circle]] [[File:MJt7.png|25px|7 Circle]]\n\nThe meld must be in absolute numerical sequence. Players cannot skip numbers or meld from the 8 or 9 to 1 or 2. The sequence must also be in the same suit. Honors, Flowers and Seasons cannot be used to make chows because they have no numerical value. A player can steal a discard to form a chow from the player whose turn was immediately before theirs if no one else needs the tile to make Pongs\/Pungs, Kongs or win (go Mahjong).\n* '''Eyes''' (also known as a pair) are 2 identical tiles which are an essential part of a legal winning hand. A piece cannot be stolen (melded) to form a pair of eyes unless the player simultaneously completes a legal winning hand.<ref>Lo, Amy (2001). ''The Book of Mahjong: An Illustrated Guide''. North Clarendon, VT: [[Tuttle Publishing|Tuttle]], p. 6. ISBN 978-0-8048-3302-8.<\/ref>\n\nFor example:\n\n[[File:MJf4.png|25px|North Wind]] [[File:MJf4.png|25px|North Wind]]\n\n[[File:MJt5.png|25px|5 Circle]] [[File:MJt5.png|25px|5 Circle]]\n\n[[File:MJs5.png|25px|5 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs5.png|25px|5 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJf1.png|25px|East Wind]] [[File:MJf1.png|25px|East Wind]]\n\n[[File:MJd3.png|25px|White Dragon]] [[File:MJd3.png|25px|White Dragon]]\n\n==== Interruption of play ====\n\n===== Flower or Season =====\nWhenever a player draws a flower or season, it is announced and then placed to the side (it is not considered a part of the hand but the player with the winning hand will earn a bonus point for them) and the last tile of the wall is drawn as a replacement tile so that the player has the 14 pieces needed before their discard. This may happen successively in a player's turn.\n\n===== Melding another player's discard =====\nWhen a player discards a tile, other players may steal the tile to complete a meld. Stealing tiles has both advantages (quickly forming a winning hand and scoring extra points) and disadvantages such as revealing part of ones hand to other players and not being able to change the meld once declared.\n\nWhen a meld (Pong, Kong or Chow) is declared through a discard, the player must state the type of meld to be declared and place the meld face up. The player must then discard a tile, and play continues to the right. If the player who melds a discard is not directly after the discarder (in order of play), one or 2 players essentially miss their turn as play continues to the player after the one who declared the meld.\n\nWhen 2 or more players call for a discarded tile, a player taking the tile to win the hand has precedence over all others. Otherwise a player who can form a ''Pong'' or ''Kong'' takes precedence over a player who claims a ''Chow''. Players may only call for a Chow from the discard of the player immediately prior to them, unless the tile is the final one required to complete the hand, but may call for a Pong or Kong from any player. A player may also take the tile to win the hand from any other player.\n\n===== Going Mahjong =====\nIf at any point in the game a player can use another player's discard to complete a legal hand (and with the agreed minimum points), they yell out Mahjong (Chinese: \u548c, Japanese: \u30ed\u30f3), take the piece and reveal their hand, with the way of calling it out depending on variations. This ends the hand, and scoring commences. If 2 or 3 players need the piece to win, there are 2 ways to resolve the issue depending on agreed table rules: Either the players compete to see who would have a better hand in terms of scoring, or simply the player closest to the discarder in order of turn wins the game.\n\nAlternatively, a player may also win by drawing the tile required to complete a legal hand on his turn (Chinese: \u81ea\u6478, Japanese: \u30c4\u30e2). This usually results in more points scored than if the player were to use another player's discard.\n\nExtra points are also scored if the dealer draws a winning hand right at the beginning of the game (Chinese: \u5929\u548c), or if another player uses the dealer's first discard to complete a winning hand (Chinese: \u5730\u548c).\n\n===== Robbing a Kong =====\nA rarely occurring and high scoring feature of Hong Kong Mahjong is a move called robbing the Kong. If a player declares a Kong (by melding it or adding a 4th piece to a Pong to form a Kong or declaring a concealed Kong) and another player(s) can use that piece to complete a hand (which by logic could not be used to form a Pong or Kong as 2 players cannot make a Pong out of the same tile) a player may steal that piece from that player when declaring the Kong and go Mahjong (win the hand).\n\n==== Example winning hands ====\nBelow are examples of winning hands. A winning hand must consist of 4 melds (Pongs, Kongs and\/or chows) and a pair (eyes) and must also score the agreed table minimum.\n\n[[File:MJs3.png|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3.png|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3.png|25px|3 Bamboo]] \u2013 [[File:MJd3.png|25px|White Dragon]] [[File:MJd3.png|25px|White Dragon]] [[File:MJd3.png|25px|White Dragon]] \u2013 [[File:MJd2.png|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2.png|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2.png|25px|Green Dragon]] \u2013 [[File:MJd1.png|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1.png|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1.png|25px|Red Dragon]] \u2013  [[File:MJf1.png|25px|East Wind]] [[File:MJf1.png|25px|East Wind]]\n\n''Hand formed with 4 Pongs and the eyes (pair) of East wind. Only bamboo is used (no other simples), scoring extra points (clean hand). No chows are used (an all Pong\/Kong hand scores extra points).''\n\n[[File:MJt1.png|25px|1 Circle]] [[File:MJt2.png|25px|2 Circle]] [[File:MJt3.png|25px|3 Circle]] \u2013 [[File:MJt4.png|25px|4 Circle]] [[File:MJt5.png|25px|5 Circle]] [[File:MJt6.png|25px|6 Circle]] \u2013 [[File:MJt7.png|25px|7 Circle]] [[File:MJt7.png|25px|7 Circle]] [[File:MJt7.png|25px|7 Circle]] \u2013 [[File:MJt9.png|25px|9 Circle]] [[File:MJt9.png|25px|9 Circle]] [[File:MJt9.png|25px|9 Circle]] \u2013 [[File:MJt8.png|25px|8 Circle]] [[File:MJt8.png|25px|8 Circle]]\n\n''A high scoring hand formed using only circles, known as a pure hand. Hand is made of chows, Pongs and the eyes of circles.''\n\nMost players include table variations in their games, of which some non-standard are included. The hands of ''7 different pairs'', ''thirteen orphans'' and ''heavenly gates'' are examples which do not have 4 melds and the eyes. They are described in more detail below.\n\n====Calling out Mahjong====\nIn Western Classical variants, this is known as creating a ''Mahjong'', and the process of winning is called ''going Mahjong''. Calling a Mahjong without having a legal hand or with the minimum points is usually penalized via points or with the player having to play the rest of the hand with his tiles shown to the other players face up.\n\n==== Turns and rounds ====\nIf the dealer wins the hand, s\/he will remain the dealer and an extra hand is played in addition to the minimum 16 hands in a match. The same occurs if there is no winner.\n\nThe dealer position is significant in that s\/he owes or is owed double their score.\n\nExtra points are also scored if their hand is composed of pieces that match their seat wind and or the prevailing wind.\n\nFlowers and Seasons are also scored as bonus points to the winner depending on their seat position.\n\n====Rhythm of play====\nAmongst players, there is an agreed amount of time allowed to make a call for a discarded tile, before the next player takes their turn, known as  \"window of opportunity\" is explicitly stated in the rules; whereas in other variants, it is generally considered that when the next player's turn starts, i.e., the tile leaves the wall, the opportunity has been lost.\n\n=== Scoring ===\n{{Main|Scoring in Mahjong}}\n\nOld Hong Kong scoring involves adding up the fan value (the value of a hand) of the winner's hand and paying the winner the appropriate sum\/points:\n* Only the winner calculates (scores) his or her hand. The winners fan value is based on:\n** individual melds\n** the composition of the entire hand\n** how the hand was won\n** bonus tiles\n** special patterns\n** and a few other special criteria.\n* In order to win, a player needs to have at least the minimum fan value agreed in advance (often 3). Bonus tiles and a few other elements are not included in the minimum fan value a player needs to form a legal winning hand. (i.e. having a flower in one's hand does not contribute to the 3 minimum fan points a player needs in a typical game).\n* When a player wins their fan value is calculated. The other players do not need to count their hands.\n* Players then pay the winner (in money or when not gambling with \"points\") based on 3 factors:\n** the fan value of the hand (converted into base points)\n** if the player won from the wall (doubles the points)\n** if the player was the dealer or not (doubles the points)\n\n==== Fan value ====\n\n===== Basic fan value =====\nA winning hand must include an agreed minimum amount of fan value (often 3)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Basic Elements\n!

A winning hand with 9 fan is worth 4 base points. The base points are doubled for the following (if 2 criteria apply, the base payment is doubled and then redoubled):\n* If the winner wins from the wall the base payment is doubled.\n* If the hand was won by discard, the discarder doubles the amount he owes the winner\n* If the winner is east he or she receives double the payment from each player. If east player is not the winner, he pays double the points to the winner.\n\n===== Examples =====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Hand 1 (West wins with 4 fan from the wall (base payment of 1))\n!

Table rules dictate if these rare and special hands are allowed, which ones, and the limit for scoring. A common scoring limit is 64 points, which is the highest base points doubled twice. A winner receives the scoring limit from each player without any doubling.\n\nIn some cases it is expected that the hand is achieved without calling any sets, except when winning, and or that it must be won from the wall.\n\nSome groups also play with the \"great Flowers\" rule. If a player picks up all 4 Flowers and all 4 Seasons during their hand, they instantly wins the hand and receives the maximum points from all of the players. This is exceptionally rare.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Limit Hands (winner receives agreed maximum payment from each player)\n! Item !!

Many variations today differ only by scoring:\n\n* '''Hong Kong Mahjong''' or '''Cantonese Mahjong''' is possibly the most common form of Mahjong, differing in minor scoring details from the Chinese Classical variety. It does not allow multiple players to win from a single discard.\n* '''[[Competition Mahjong scoring rules|Competition Mahjong]]''' is an international standard that some Mahjong societies have adopted for competition play and in some cases for all play.\n* '''Chinese classical Mahjong''' is the oldest variety of Mahjong and was the version introduced to America in the 1920s under various names. It has a small, loyal following in the West, although few play it in Asia.\n* '''Sichuan Mahjong''' is a growing variety, particularly in southern China, disallowing chi melds, and using only the suited tiles. It can be played very quickly.\n* '''Wuhan Mahjong''' is growing rapidly and become popular in southern China. It's different from other parts of China in a way that 1) it has a tile that can be used as everything, called Laizi (\u8d56\u5b50), and 2) you have to have a set of special 2 tiles, namely 2, 5, 8, as prerequisite for winning. Another variation has become the new trend, it's called \u7ea2\u4e2d\u8d56\u5b50\u6760. Special tiles need to be discarded (\u7ea2\u4e2d\u548c\u8d56\u5b50). \n* '''Tianjin Mahjong''' using normally 7 jokers, with special scoring such as ''joker-free'', ''joker-waiting-pair'', ''catch-5'', ''dragon'', ''joker-suited-dragon''.\n* '''Shenyang Mahjong''' using 13 hands in a game, and Shenyang Mahjong has a really fast speed on playing, which is matching the personality of North-east people in China. Also in Shenyang Mahjong, the player must to have Bamboos, Characters, Circles and number one or 9 in his hand. In addition, the players have to Pong before they Chow, so there is no chance to win even if some players win at the first time they have their hands in hand.\n* '''Taiwanese Mahjong''' is the variety prevalent in Taiwan and involves hands of 16 tiles (as opposed to the 13-tile hands in other versions), features bonuses for dealers and recurring dealerships, and allows multiple players to win from a single discard.\n* '''Fujian Mahjong''', with a ''D\u00e0id\u00ec'' joker \u5e36\u5f1f\u767e\u642d.\n* '''Shanxi Mahjong''', or ''Lisi'' (Raise 4; [[:zh:\u592a\u539f\u7acb\u56db\u9ebb\u5c06]]), the players must win with the first 4 blocks drawn which are placed separately in front of other. These 4 blocks cannot be touched until the player has a ready hand.\n* '''[[Guobiao Majiang]]''' a rule of Mahjong founded by All-China Sports Federation in July 1998.\n* '''[[Japanese Mahjong]]''' is a standardized form of Mahjong in Japan and is also found prevalently in video games. In addition to scoring changes, the rules of ''[[Japanese Mahjong#R\u012bchi|r\u012bchi]]'' (ready hand) and ''[[Japanese Mahjong scoring rules#Dora|dora]]'' (bonus tiles) are unique highlights of this variant. In addition, tile discards are specifically arranged in front of each player by discard order, to take discarded tiles into account during play.  Some rules replace some of number 5 tiles with red tiles so that they can eventually get more value. <!--A standard rule set for Japanese mahjong was designed in 2008 by the European Mahjong Association,<ref>[http:\/\/gamenoodle.blogspot.com\/2012\/09\/mahjongs.html European Mahjong Association]<\/ref> in cooperation with the Japan Mahjong Organizing Committee, in order to organize the first European Riichi Mahjong Championship in Hanover, Germany, June 2008. Danish player Thomas Kragh was the winner.<ref>[http:\/\/www.mahjongnews.com\/en\/index.php\/ec-riichi\/54-ec-2008\/104-rmc2008.html]<\/ref>-->\n* '''Western classical Mahjong''' is a descendant of the version of Mahjong introduced by Babcock to America in the 1920s. Today, this term largely refers to the \"[[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base|Wright-Patterson]]\" rules, used in the U.S. military, and other similar American-made variants that are closer to the Babcock rules.\n* '''[[American mahjong|American Mahjong]]''' is a form of Mahjong standardized by the National Mah Jongg League<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.nationalmahjonggleague.org |title=National Mahjjong League |publisher=Nationalmahjonggleague.org |date= |accessdate=7 September 2012}}<\/ref> and the American Mah-Jongg Association.<ref>[http:\/\/amja.net Amja]<\/ref> It uses joker tiles, the Charleston, plus melds of 5 or more tiles, and eschews the Chow and the notion of a standard hand. Purists claim that this makes American Mahjong a separate game. In addition, the NMJL and AMJA variations, which differ by minor scoring differences, are commonly referred to as ''Mahjongg'' or ''mah-jongg'' (with 2 Gs, often hyphenated).\n* '''[[Singaporean mahjong|Singaporean Mahjong]]''' is a variant similar to the Cantonese Mahjong played in Malaysia. Unique elements of Singaporean\/Malaysian Mahjong are the 4 animal tiles (cat, mouse, cockerel, and centipede) as well as certain alternatives in the scoring rules, which allow payouts midway through the game if certain conditions (such as a ''kang'') are met.\n* '''South African Mahjong''' is a variant of Cantonese Mahjong. It is very similar in terms of game play and follows most of the rules and regulations of Cantonese Mahjong. However, there are some minor differences in scoring, e.g. the limit on the maximum points a hand can be rewarded is 3 or 4 ''fan'' depending on the ''house'' rules. A chicken hand (gai wu) is normally considered a value hand. Depending on the ''house'' rules ''Flowers'' may also be used to boost scoring.\n* '''Vietnamese m\u1ea1t ch\u01b0\u1ee3c''', with 16 different kinds of jokers for a total of 160 tiles.  Modern variant include more jokers for a total of 176 tiles.\n* '''Thai Mahjong''', includes the older Vietnamese tiles with 8 extra Flowers for a total of 168 tiles.\n* '''Filipino Mahjong''', with the Window Joker.\n* '''Korean Mahjong''' is unique in many ways and is an excellent version for 3 players. One suit is omitted completely (usually the Bamboo set or 2-8 of bamboo) as well as the Seasons. The scoring is simpler and the play is faster. No melded chows are allowed and concealed hands are common. Riichi (much like its Japanese cousin) is an integral part of the game as well.[http:\/\/mahjong.wikidot.com\/rules:korean-overview Korean Rules]\n* '''Pussers bones''' is a fast-moving variant developed by sailors in the [[Royal Australian Navy]]. It uses an alternative vocabulary, such as ''Eddie'', ''Sammy'', ''Wally'', and ''Normie'', instead of ''East'', ''South'', ''West'', and ''North'' respectively.\n* '''[[Three player mahjong|3 player Mahjong]]''' (or 3-''ka'') is a simplified 3-person Mahjong that involves hands of 13 tiles (with a total of 84 tiles on the table) and may use jokers depending on the variation. Any rule set can be adapted for 3 players; however, this is far more common and accepted in Japan, Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines. It usually eliminates one suit entirely, or tiles 2-8 in one suit leaving only the terminals. It needs fewer people to start a game and the turnaround time of a game is short\u2014hence, it is considered a fast game. In some versions there is a jackpot for winning in which whoever accumulates a point of 10 is considered to hit the jackpot or whoever scores 3 hidden hands first. The Malaysian and Korean versions drop one wind and may include a seat dragon. [http:\/\/mahjong.wikidot.com\/rules:three-player Korean Japanese 3 player variant].\n* '''Mah Jongg Card Game''' by [[Winning Moves]] is a card game variant based on the basic Mah Jonng game.\n\n=== Equipment ===\n{{Main|Mahjong tiles}}\nThere are variations that feature specific use of tiles. Some 3 player versions remove the North Wind and one Chinese provincial version has no honors. Korean Mahjong removes the bamboo suit or at least its numbers 2\u20138 so that terminals can be used. Japanese Mahjong rarely uses Flowers or Seasons. The Seasons are removed in Korean Mahjong, while Singapore\/Malaysian Mahjong has a third set of bonus tiles called animals and even a 4th called vehicles. Joker tiles are used in some versions. Some variations use counting sticks while others use chips, and some use pencils and paper for score keeping.\n\n=== Rules ===\nJapanese and Korean Mahjong have some special rules. A player cannot win by a discard if that player had already discarded that piece, where players' discards are kept in neat rows in front of them. Players may declare ready, meaning that they need one tile to win, cannot change their hand and win extra points if they win. Some rules may replace some of the number 5 tiles with red tiles, as they can earn more points. Korean Mahjong does not allow melded (stolen) chows.\nTaiwanese Mahjong adds 3 tiles to a hand requiring a 5th set to be formed, making a clean hand or all Pong hand very difficult to procure.\nAmerican Mahjong has distinctive game mechanics and the article on [[American mahjong|American Mahjong]] details these. Some differences include many special patterns, a different scoring system and the use of jokers and 5 of a kind.\n\n===Scoring===\nScoring in Mahjong involves points, with a monetary value for points agreed upon by players. Although in many variations scoreless hands are possible, many require that hands be of some point value in order to win the hand.\n\nWhile the basic rules are more or less the same throughout Mahjong, the greatest divergence between variations lies in the scoring systems.  Like the rules, there is a generalized system of scoring, based on the method of winning and the winning hand, from which Chinese and Japanese base their roots.  American Mahjong generally has greatly divergent scoring rules, as well as greatly divergent general rules.\n\nBecause of the large differences between the various systems of scoring (especially for Chinese variants), groups of players will often agree on particular scoring rules before a game.\n\n'''Points''' (terminology of which differs from variation to variation) are obtained by matching the winning hand with different criteria scoring different values. The points obtained may be modified into scores for each player using some (typically [[exponential function|exponential]]) functions. Some criteria may be also in terms of both points and score.\n\nIn many variations the dealer receives no scoring bonus and does not maintain his\/her turn by winning or a dead hand.\n\nIn classical Mahjong all players score points. Points are given for sets and hand composition and winning bonuses, doubled and redoubled for basic patterns. Sometimes a loser may score more points than a winner. Japanese Mahjong has a complex scoring system with several stages of scoring, rules and exceptions, evening out scores and bonus points at the end of a match. Korean Mahjong has a simple scoring system where only winner scores without any form of doubling.\n\nSome variations give points for concealed hands, in which case no melds are made except by winning on a discard.\n\nIn Old Hong Kong Mahjong:\n* Only the winner scores points.\n* Winning hands are scored by totaling the point value of each element in the hand. Points are distinct from the actual payment received from each player.\n* The winner receives points (also known as faan among some players) for:\n** individual melds,\n** the composition of the entire hand,\n** how the hand was won,\n** bonus tiles,\n** special patterns,\n** and a few other special criteria.\n* In order to win, a player needs to have at least the minimum points agreed in advance (often 3).\n* Bonus points are separate from the minimum points a player needs to win.\n* If a player goes Mahjong with a legal and minimum hand, his\/her hand is scored by adding his\/her points and bonus points together.\n* The payment received from each player depends on 3 factors:\n** the point value of the hand,\n** if the player won from a discard or from the wall, and\n** if the player was the dealer or not.\n\n=== Wildcards ===\nSome players accept wildcards (Chinese: \u6df7\u513f\uff0chunr) when playing Mahjong. The wildcards are decided at the beginning of the game. The wildcard can be the next tile after spreading tiles to all players or separately decided by a dice toss. Wildcards are not allowed to be discarded and can replace any tiles in Chows. Wildcards can't replace any tiles in Pongs and Kongs.\nFor example, if a character 4 taken out, then character 4 and the next number 5 can be used as wildcards in this round (When the tile showed, the tiles of the same pattern left only 3, so the next tile in the suit will be used as wildcards as well, adding to 7 wildcards for 4 players). Also, if a tile numbered 9 is chosen, then the number 9 and 1 are wildcards.\nAlso, if the chosen tile is not in the simples, the wildcards are decided in rules:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

One example is the Pure Green hand made of chows or Pongs using 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 of bamboo and green dragon.\n\n=== Flowers ===\nJapanese rule sets discourage the use of Flowers and Seasons. Korean rules and 3-player Mahjong in the Korean\/Japanese tradition use only Flowers. In Singapore and Malaysia an extra set of bonus tiles of 4 animals are used. The rule set includes a unique function in that players who get 2 specific animals get a one-time immediate payout from all players. In Taiwanese Mahjong, getting all 8 Flowers and Seasons constitutes an automatic win of the hand and specific payout from all players.\n\n4 of the flower tiles represent the [[Four Gentlemen|4 noble plants]] of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] reckoning:\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc22 }}[[Prunus mume|plum]],\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc23 }}[[orchid]],\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc25 }}[[chrysanthemum]],\n* and{{hide in print| \ud83c\udc24 }}[[bamboo]].\n\n[[File:MJh5.png|Plum]] [[File:MJh6.png|Orchid]] [[File:MJh7.png|Chrysanthemum]] [[File:MJh8.png|Bamboo]]\n\nThe other 4 flower tiles (or season tiles) represent Seasons:\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc26 }} [[spring (season)|spring]],\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc27 }} [[summer]],\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc28 }} [[autumn]],\n* and{{hide in print| \ud83c\udc29 }}[[winter]].\n\n[[File:MJh1.png|Spring]] [[File:MJh2.png|Summer]] [[File:MJh3.png|Autumn]] [[File:MJh4.png|Winter]]\n\nThe animal tiles used in Malaysia, Singapore and local variations are the animals. They represent the [[cat]], [[mouse]], [[cockerel]] and [[centipede]].\n\n[[File:MJAT1.jpg|Cat|44*53]] [[File:MJAT2.jpg|Mouse|44*53]] [[File:MJAT3.jpg|Cockerel|44*53]] [[File:MJAT4.jpg|Centipede|44*53]]\n\n=== Number of tiles ===\nAll tiles are placed face down and shuffled.  Each player then stacks a row of tiles 2 tiles high in front of him, the length of the row depending on the number of tiles in use:\n* 136 tiles: 17 stacks for each player\n** Suits of dots, bamboos, and characters + winds + dragons\n* 144 tiles: 18 stacks for each player\n* 148 tiles: 19 stacks for dealer and player opposite, 18 for rest\n* 152 tiles: 19 stacks for each player\n\n=== Charleston ===\nIn the American variations it is required that, before each hand begins, a Charleston be enacted. In the first exchange, 3 tiles are passed to the player on one's right; in the next exchange, the tiles are passed to the player opposite, followed by 3 tiles passed to the left. If all players are in agreement, a second Charleston is performed; however, any player may decide to stop passing after the first Charleston is complete. The Charleston is followed by an optional pass to the player across of one, 2, or 3 tiles. The Charleston, a distinctive feature of American Mahjong, may have been borrowed from card games such as [[Hearts (card game)|Hearts]].\n\n=== Jokers ===\nA feature of several variations of Mahjong, most notably American variations, is the notion of some number of  Joker tiles. They may be used as a wild card: a substitute for any tile in a hand, or, in some variations, only tiles in melds. Another variation is that the Joker tile may ''not'' be used for melding. Depending on the variation, a player may replace a Joker tile that is part of an exposed meld belonging to any player with the tile it represents.\n\nRules governing discarding Joker tiles also exist; some variations permit the Joker tile to take on the identity of any tile, and others only permit the Joker tile to take on the identity of the previously discarded tile (or the absence of a tile, if it is the first discard).\n\nJoker tiles may or may not have an impact on scoring, depending on the variation. Some special hands may require the use of Joker tiles (for example, to represent a \"fifth tile\" of a certain suited or honor tile).\n\nIn American Mahjong, it is illegal to pass Jokers during the Charleston.\n\n=== Ready hands ===\nWhen a hand is one tile short of winning (for example: [[File:MJs1.png|25px|1 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs2.png|25px|2 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3.png|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs1.png|25px|1 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs2.png|25px|2 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3.png|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs2.png|25px|2 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3.png|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs7.png|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs8.png|25px|8 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs9.png|25px|9 Bamboo]] [[File:MJd2.png|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2.png|25px|Green Dragon]], waiting for: [[File:MJs1.png|25px|1 Bamboo]], [[File:MJs4.png|25px|4 Bamboo]], or [[File:MJd2.png|25px|Green Dragon]], as [[File:MJs1.png|25px|1 Bamboo]] can be the eyes), the hand is said to be a ready hand (Traditional Chinese: \u807d\u724c; Simplified Chinese: \u542c\u724c; Japanese: ''tenpai'' \u8074\u724c), or more figuratively, \"on the pot\". The player holding a ready hand is said to be ''waiting'' for certain tiles. It is common to be waiting for 2 or 3 tiles, and some variations award points for a hand that is waiting for one tile. In 13-tile Mahjong, the largest number of tiles for which a player can wait is 13 (the ''[[Hong Kong Mahjong scoring rules#Non-standard special hands|thirteen wonders]]'', or ''thirteen orphans'', a nonstandard special hand). Ready hands must be declared in some variations of Mahjong, while other variations prohibit the same.\n\nSome variations of Mahjong, most notably Japanese and Korean ones, allow a player to declare {{nihongo||\u7acb\u76f4|''r\u012bchi''|sometimes known as ''reach'', as it is phonetically similar}}. A declaration of ''r\u012bchi'' is a promise that any tile drawn by the player is immediately discarded unless it constitutes a win. Standard requirements for ''r\u012bchi'' are that the hand be ''closed'' or have no melds declared (other than a concealed Kong) and that players already have points for declaration of ''r\u012bchi''. A player who declares ''r\u012bchi'' and wins usually receives a point bonus for their hand directly, and a player who won with ''r\u012bchi'' also has the advantage to open the inner {{nihongo||\u30c9\u30e9|''dora''|from \"dra\"gon}} which leads to higher possibilities to match such a card, thus has more chance to grant additional bonus. However, a player who declares ''r\u012bchi'' and loses is usually penalized in some fashion. Declaring a nonexistent ''r\u012bchi'' is also penalized in some way.\n\nIn some variations, a situation in which all 4 players declare a ''r\u012bchi'' is an automatic drawn game, as it reduces the game down to pure luck, i.e., who gets their needed tile first.\n\n=== Draws ===\nIf only the dead wall remains (or if no dead wall exists and the wall is depleted) and no one has won, the hand is drawn (\u6d41\u5c40 ''li\u00fa j\u00fa'', \u9ec3\u838a ''hu\u00e1ng zhu\u0101ng'', Japanese ''ry\u016bkyoku''), or \"[[goulash]]ed\". A new hand begins, and depending on the variant, the Game Wind may change. For example, in most playing circles in Singapore, if there is at least one Kong when the hand is a draw, the following player of the dealer becomes the next dealer; otherwise, the dealer remains dealer.\n\nJapanese Mahjong has a special rule called {{nihongo||\u4e09\u5bb6\u548c|''sanchah\u014d''}}, which is, if 3 players claim the same discard in order to win, the hand is drawn. One reason for this is that there are cases in which bars of 1,000 points for declaring ''r\u012bchi'' cannot be divided by 3. The rule is treated the same as \"abortive draws\".\n\n=== Abortive draws ===\nIn Japanese Mahjong, rules allow abortive draws to be declared while tiles are still available. They can be declared under the following conditions:\n* {{nihongo||\u4e5d\u7a2e\u4e48\u4e5d\u724c\u5012\u724c|Ky\u016bshu yaoch\u016bhai t\u014dhai}}: On a player's first turn when no meld has been declared yet, if a player has 9 different terminal (also known as major<ref>{{cite web|author=Peter Gregory |url=http:\/\/mahjongbritishrules.com\/scoring\/index.html |title=Tile Classification |publisher=Mahjongbritishrules.com |date= |accessdate=7 September 2012}}<\/ref>) or honor tiles, the player may declare the hand to be drawn (for example, [[File:MJt1.png|25px|1 Circle]] [[File:MJt4.png|25px|4 Circle]] [[File:MJt5.png|25px|5 Circle]] [[File:MJt9.png|25px|9 Circle]] [[File:MJs1.png|25px|1 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs4.png|25px|4 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs6.png|25px|6 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs9.png|25px|9 Bamboo]] [[File:MJw1.png|25px|1 Character]] [[File:MJf1.png|25px|East Wind]] [[File:MJf3.png|25px|West Wind]] [[File:MJd1.png|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1.png|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd3.png|25px|White Dragon]], but could also go for the nonstandard ''[[Hong Kong Mahjong scoring rules#Non-standard special hands|thirteen wonders]]'' hand as well).\n* {{nihongo||\u56db\u98a8\u5b50\u9023\u6253|S\u016bfontsu rent\u0101}}: On the first turn without any meld declarations, if all 4 players discard the same Wind tile, the hand is drawn.\n* {{nihongo||\u56db\u5bb6\u7acb\u76f4|S\u016bcha r\u012bchi}}: If all 4 players declare ''r\u012bchi'', the hand is drawn.\n* {{nihongo||\u56db\u69d3\u7b97\u4e86|S\u016bkan sanra}}: The hand is drawn when the 4th Kong is declared, unless all 4 Kongs were declared by a single player. Still, the hand is drawn when another player declares a fifth Kong.\n\n== Competition ==\n[[File:wk-mahjong2002.jpg|thumb|The top 3 in the [[World Mahjong Championship]] in [[Tokyo]], October 2002.

From left: Kohichi Oda (2), Martin Wedel Jacobsen (1), and Benjamin Boas (3)]]\n\nIn 1998, in the interest of dissociating illegal gambling from Mahjong, the [[China State Sports Commission]] published a new set of rules, now generally referred to as Chinese Official rules or International Tournament rules (see [[Guobiao Majiang]]). The principles of the new, wholesome Mahjong are no gambling, no drinking, and no smoking. In international tournaments, players are often grouped in teams to emphasize that Mahjong from now on is considered a sport.\n\nThe new rules are highly pattern-based. The rulebook contains 81 combinations, based on patterns and scoring elements popular in classic and modern regional Chinese variants; some table practices of Japan have also been adopted. Points for flower tiles (each flower is worth one point) may not be added until the player has scored 8 points. The winner of a game receives the score from the player who discards the winning tile, plus 8 basic points from each player; in the case of ''zimo'' (self-drawn win), he receives the value of this round plus 8 points from all players.\n\nThe new rules were first used in an international tournament in [[Tokyo]], where, in 2002, the first World Championship in Mahjong was organized by the Mahjong Museum, the Japan Mahjong Organizing Committee, and the city council of Ningbo, China. One hundred players participated, mainly from Japan and China, but also from Europe and the United States. Mai Hatsune, from Japan, became the first world champion. The following year saw the first annual China Mahjong Championship, held in Hainan; the next 2 annual tournaments were held in Hong Kong and Beijing. Most players were Chinese; players from other nations attended as well.\n\nIn 2005, the first Open European Mahjong Championship<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.mahjongnews.com\/oemc2005.htm |title=The Independent Internet Mahjong Newspaper |publisher=Mahjongnews.com |date= |accessdate=7 September 2012}}<\/ref> was held in the Netherlands, with 108 players. The competition was won by Masato Chiba from Japan. The second European championship<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.mahjongnews.com\/en\/index.php\/oemc\/oemc2007\/121-oemc2007.html |title=Martin Wedel Jacobsen European mahjong champion |publisher=Mahjongnews.com |date=20 June 2007 |accessdate=7 September 2012}}<\/ref> in [[Copenhagen]](2007) was attended by 136 players and won by Danish player Martin Wedel Jacobsen. The first Online European Mahjong Championship was held on the Mahjong Time server in 2007, with 64 players, and the winner was Juliani Leo, from the U.S., and the Best European Player was Gerda van Oorschot, from the Netherlands. The Third Open European Mahjong Championship 2009<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.mahjongnews.com\/en\/index.php\/oemc\/oemc2009\/283-oemc2009ranking9.html |title=OEMC 2009 Final Ranking |publisher=Mahjongnews.com |date=5 July 2009 |accessdate=7 September 2012}}<\/ref> at Baden\/[[Vienna]], [[Austria]], was won by Japanese player Koji Idota, while runner-up Bo Lang from Switzerland became European Champion. There were 152 participants.\n\nIn 2006, the [[World Mahjong Organization]] (WMO) was founded in [[Beijing]], China, with the cooperation of, amongst others, the Japan Mahjong Organizing Committee (JMOC) and the European Mahjong Association (EMA). This organization held its first World Championship in November 2007 in the Chinese town of [[Chengdu]], attended by 144 participants from all over the world. It was won by Li Li, a Chinese student at [[Tsinghua University]]. The next World Championship took place in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], the Netherlands, 27 to 29 August 2010.\n\nWestern or American-style mah jongg tournaments are held in virtually every state\u2014the largest is in Las Vegas, Nevada twice a year, and in Atlantic City, New Jersey, by Mah Jongg Madness; and the annual cruise hosted by the National Mah Jongg League and Mah Jongg Madness (MJM).  MJM tournaments host between 150 and 500 participants at these larger events; and there are several smaller scale, but equally successful tournaments held annually by other hosts. Prize pools are based on the number participating. Rules are based on the National Mah Jongg League standard rules.\n\n== Superstitions ==\nThere are many superstitions associated with the game of Mahjong. For example, players will try to find seats with the best [[Feng Shui]] or wear their lucky clothing or trinkets.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lam|first=Desmond|title=Chinese Gambling Superstitions and Taboos|url=http:\/\/www.urbino.net\/articles.cfm?specificArticle=Chinese%20Gambling%20Superstitions%20and%20Taboos}}<\/ref>\n\nSome superstitious rituals in Mahjong can involve things from not counting one's wins and losses, to changing one's underwear after a loss.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u9ebb\u5c06\u4e4b\u8ff7\u4fe1\u6280\u5de7|url=http:\/\/www.majiangjing.com\/mjsh.asp?id=1918}}<\/ref>\n\n== Unicode ==\n{{Main|Mahjong Tiles (Unicode block)}}\n\nMahjong tiles were added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in April, 2008 with the release of version 5.1.\n\nThe Unicode block for Mahjong tiles is U+1F000\u2013U+1F02F:\n{{noprint|\n{{Unicode chart Mahjong Tiles}}\n}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Games played with Mahjong equipment]]\n* [[Mahjong video game]]\n* [[Singaporean Mahjong scoring rules]]\n* [[Khanhoo]]\n* [[Madiao]]\n* [[Chinese playing cards]]\n\n==References==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Further reading ===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* Lo, Amy.

[[Michael Joseph (publisher)|Michael Joseph]])]]\n'''''The Lotus and the Wind''''' is a [[Spy fiction|spy novel]] by [[John Masters]] published in 1953. It continues his saga of the Savage family, who are part of the [[British Raj]] in India, and is set against the backdrop of the [[Great Game]], the period of tension between Britain and Russia in [[Central Asia]] during the late nineteenth century.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe story is told through the viewpoint of Lieutenant Robin Savage and the innocent but determined Anne Hildreth, although Savage's viewpoint predominates later in the novel. It begins in 1879, when Britain and [[Afghanistan]] are engaged in the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]].\n\nAnne Hildreth and Robin Savage have met and become attracted to each other before the narrative starts. Anne is the daughter of a [[Commissariat]] officer and is travelling with her parents to the military post at [[Peshawar]] in the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u20131955)|North-West Frontier Province]] of India. En route, she witnesses the murder of an Afghan stranger. In his last moments, the murdered man writes the word \"atlar\" (horses) in his own blood.\n\nMeanwhile, Robin is part of a military column in Afghanistan. He is the son of a distinguished soldier and has almost been forced to follow in his father's footsteps, but has no particular thirst for action. As the result of an accident, and a superior officer's bungling, he is accused of cowardice, and is also sent to Peshawar to await a military court of inquiry.\n\nLife threatens to be awkward, but an acquaintance, Major Hayling, connects the murder witnessed by Anne with a souvenir collected by Robin in Afghanistan, a [[jezail]] with the words \"atlar shimal\" (horses, north) engraved on it. Realising that Robin's true passion is for solitude and empty spaces, Hayling recruits him into the Secret Service and sends him in disguise into Central Asia. Accompanied by a faithful [[Gurkha]] orderly, Robin sets out to discover the motive behind the murder and determine whether it is connected with the ambitions of [[Tsarist]] Russia.\n\n==Relations to other books in the series==\nRobin is the son of Rodney Savage, the protagonist of ''[[Nightrunners of Bengal]]''. Robin is around two years old when the [[Sepoy Mutiny]] occurs and his mother is murdered. Robin's son is Peter Savage, who features in ''Far, Far the Mountain Peak''.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lotus And The Wind, The}}\n[[Category:1953 novels]]\n[[Category:Novels by John Masters]]\n[[Category:Novels set in India]]\n[[Category:1879 in fiction]]\n[[Category:British India in fiction]]\n[[Category:Novels about The Great Game]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Afghanistan]]\n[[Category:Chitrali culture]]\n[[Category:Peshawar]]\n\n\n{{Spy-novel-stub}}","timestamp":"20160410100313","user-timestamp":"20150410100313"},{"title":"User talk:67.168.234.81","content":"== September 2008 ==\n[[Image:Information.svg|25px|]] Welcome to Wikipedia.

People with a close connection to a subject are not absolutely prohibited from editing about that subject, but they need to be especially careful about ensuring their edits are verified by [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]] and writing with as little bias as possible.  \n\nIf you are very close to a subject, here are some ways you can reduce the risk of problems:\n\n*'''Avoid or exercise great caution when editing or creating''' articles related to you, your organization, or its competitors, as well as projects and products they are involved with.\n*'''Be cautious about deletion discussions'''.  Everyone is welcome to provide information about [[Wikipedia:Independent sources|independent sources]] in [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|deletion discussions]], but avoid advocating for deletion of articles about your competitors.\n*'''Avoid linking''' to the Wikipedia article or website of your organization in other articles (see [[Wikipedia:Spam]]).\n*'''Exercise great caution''' so that you do not accidentally breach Wikipedia's content policies. \n\nPlease familiarize yourself with relevant content policies and guidelines, especially those pertaining to [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]], [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiability of information]], and [[Wikipedia:Autobiography|autobiographies]].\n\nFor information on how to contribute to Wikipedia when you have a conflict of interest, please see [[Wikipedia:FAQ\/Organizations|our frequently asked questions for organizations]].

This has been done under two or more of the [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|criteria for speedy deletion]], by which articles can be deleted at any time, without discussion. If the page meets any of these strictly-defined criteria, then it may be soon be deleted by an administrator. The reasons it has been tagged are:\n* It seems to be unambiguous advertising which only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become encyclopedic. (See [[WP:CSD#G11|section G11 of the criteria for speedy deletion]].) Please read [[Wikipedia:Spam|the guidelines on spam]] and [[Wikipedia:FAQ\/Business]] for more information.\n*It appears to be a clear [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright]] infringement. (See [[WP:CSD#G12|section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion]].) For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of ''information'', but not as a source of ''sentences''. This part is crucial: ''say it in your own words''. Wikipedia takes copyright violations very seriously and persistent violators '''will be [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked from editing]]'''. <p>If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text \u2014 which means allowing other people to modify it \u2014 then you ''must'' verify that externally by one of the processes explained at [[Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials]]. If you are not the owner of the external website but have permission from that owner, see [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission]]. However, even if you use one of these processes to release copyrighted material to Wikipedia, it still needs to comply with the other [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines|policies and guidelines]] to be eligible for inclusion. If you would like any assistance with this, you can ask a question at the [[Wikipedia:Help desk|help desk]].<\/p> \n\nIf you think this page should not be deleted for this reason, you may '''contest the nomination''' by [[:Hawelia Group|visiting the page]] and clicking the button labelled \"Click here to contest this speedy deletion\". This will give you the opportunity to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. However, be aware that once a page is tagged for speedy deletion, it may be removed without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag from the page yourself, but do not hesitate to add information in line with [[Wikipedia:List of policies|Wikipedia's policies and guidelines]].
