The instruments were so-named because electronics were mounted in plastic kitchenware while ''gamelan'' was a metaphor for collaborative musical engagement. They were easy to play and quick to learn and were used principally to accompany dance.

Therefore, both the presence of any active ingredient and the therapeutic efficacy of these medicines have been contentious because the existence of even traces of the starting raw materials in them is inconceivable. However, physicochemical studies of these solutions have unequivocally established the presence of the starting raw materials in nanoparticulate form even in these extreme (super-Avogadro, >10(23)) dilutions.

They found that metal derived \"remedies\" may contain metal particles even when they're (theoretically) diluted down so much that they shouldn't. That's not because the metal \"imprints\" itself on the solvent, it's because their dilution process is flawed. What does that mean for \"high potencies\" of soluble substances? Nothing, they're still unlikely to contain even a single molecule of \"active\" ingredient. What does that mean for the efficacy of metal based \"remedies\"? Not much - it's not ''impossible'' for them to have an effect since they contain material doses of \"active\" ingredients, but it remains to be seen if these ingredients do anything. What these papers do show is that it's pretty much futile to try to produce \"high potencies\" of metals. Do you think homeopaths will stop prescribing \"high potencies\" of metals? --[[User:Six words|Six words]] ([[User talk:Six words|talk]]) 16:51, 15 December 2012 (UTC)\n\n:::: Ok, if I omit those arguments from your response which are irrelevant (\"imprint\", \"efficacy\", \"futile\" etc.) to the discussion (whether or not the proposed sentences should be added), you basically agree that it is true, you just don't think it means much, right? But of course it means much, because THIS PRECISE supposition (there is nothing there but sugar) was and is the primary factor why homeopathy was and is being ridiculed. Now that we know that THERE IS something in there, beside sugar (nano-bubbles which MULTIPLY with continuing process of dilution), I think it is a BIG DEAL and we should let the world know. Those papers claim there is SOMETHING measurable and that they can distinguish among different potencies which was not possible until now. In the light of these works, it is no longer correct to say those remedies are just sugar and that not a single molecule of the original substance is present (and therefore it cannot do anything). Of course, it does not prove efficacy, but that is NOT THE POINT here.

Study the history of homeopathy and you'll find the results of homeopathy far surpassed any other then-accepted medical practice. That's why some allopathic medical doctors turned homeopaths, BUT NOT the other way around. There is so much historical evidence in favor of homeopathy you would drown in it, but of course these are not permissible, I guess, as they are from historical records, but most importantly, they are not tolerable because they are favorable to homeopathy. \n\n:::::: '''I will give you just one little example. In 1849, there was a major epidemic of cholera all over the world. In Cincinnati, Pulte and Erhmann treated 2600 cases with only 35 deaths, or a mortality rate of 1.3%. The mortality rate for cholera in the 19th century was 50%, regardless of the physician, the place, the country or whether the patient was treated. In Asia, in Egypt, in Tunisia, in Turkey, they didn\u2019t have treatment, and the mortality, was around 50%. And all this despite having 60-70 cases that were in a deep state of collapse. Now, there was a skeptic that said that they cheated. So there was a commission that was instigated, and the commission was chaired by Alphonso Taft, who became Secretary of War eventually under Grant, and his son became President of the United States, so he was a reputable person, and the commission\u2019s outcome was that what the homeopaths had reported was exactly true to the point, in every single case.'''\n\n:::::: 19th century was a golden age of homeopathy, with a great many journals covering the topic and mountains of statistics of cured cases of serious diseases. If you studied those, you would be amazed how much evidence there is for homeopathy. \n\n:::::: Back to the point - homeopathy was ridiculed BECAUSE OF THE SMALL DOSES IT USED. But this only came very gradually. At first, Hahnemann used crude (physical) doses of remedies prescribed on homeopathic principles and only diminished them slowly as he progressed in his experiments and as his experience dictated. Hahnemann was a scientist and he did many experiments to test what works and what does not and modified his methods accordingly.

I agree materia medica is more fundamental, and indeed a repertory is but an index although as an index it does stand on its own. In practice a homeopath may often use just a repertory in conjunction with their knowledge of materia medica rather than the books themselves. The materia medica are more than just records of provings - they are descriptions of the whole effect of the medicines based on the provings, clinical experience and frequently a summary and interpretation of those. Further, they also use computer versions of these. So I suggest:\n::\"Homeopaths select remedies by consulting reference sources known as repertories and descriptions of the remedies in materia medica.\"\n:Further in the article I think it is worth going into more detail about this process and the sources that are used ie more than is currently there.

The second is not an independent piece of research concluding that homoeopathy works but an editorial piece by a homoeopath attacking the Shang analysis.  The third actually states \"Our results do neither prove that homeopathic medicines are superior to placebo nor do they prove the opposite\" so cannot be used to support a statement that homoeopathy works better than placebo, and its attempt to attack the Shang analysis has been comprehensively shot down [http:\/\/www.sciencebasedmedicine.org\/index.php\/fun-with-homeopaths-and-meta-analyses-of-homeopathy-trials\/ here].

[[Quotemining]], for example, is not neutral and often uses the words of an author inappropriately in a way they did not intend. Context matters, and so it is important to look at the entirety of the work. This snippet you've picked implies something. If the authors have contradicted that implication later in the very same review, then we can't just lift your quote, because it carries with it an implication which is untrue. Secondly, it is important to weight sources against others, so that we accurately reflect consensus within the whole body of the literature, not just one paper. The quote you've selected implies something with which every other quality paper disagrees, [[AFAIK]]. If all of that is so, then plopping your quote into the lead would imply something which is explicitly rejected by the authors of the paper, and not reflected in any of the rest of the literature, and we would be stating it without qualification as though it were significant of the whole field of study. That would be inappropriate for an encyclopedia. We can certainly include quotes in the article, but they have to be selected with that context in mind.

'''It is the author's  entire summary of their own systematic review''' which ,by definition, does not introduce any bias of my part.

According to wiki guide we are not suppose to evaluate the original sources but to report their findings accurately . Original research is not allowed,  I thought. \n\n3. Then you wrote '''\"The quote you've selected implies something with which every other quality paper disagrees,\"''' So the author's entire summary - I would call it and again and  I did not \"select\" it -- really says something which departs with several other papers cited . I agree with you.  The journal is almost equally important to the Lancet in terms of weighting its value. Wikipedia articles suppose to report  every uncertainty and controversy as long as it is presented in an exceptional reliable source. Why wikipedia has excluded this view ? Isn't that a violation of Neutral point of view policy?  Furthermore I produced several exceptional sources which depart from wikipidia current point of view(http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12634583, http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1375230. http:\/\/www.anthromed.org\/UploadedDocuments\/LuedtkeRuttenJCE08.pdf. http:\/\/www.thelancet.com\/journals\/lancet\/article\/PIIS0140-6736%2805%2967878-6\/fulltext.\n\n4.The authors of the review DO NOT say that homeopathy is proven.

I'll try to leave you with a parting explanation, but if you're still hung up on including the quote after, then you'd have to seek dispute resolution from somewhere else (see [[WP:DR]].

Ignoring what they say ''in'' the review because there's a snippet at the beginning we like would go against NPOV - especially when that snippet contradicts every other reliable source we have. I told you what we'd need to include this above: more unambiguous sourcing.\n\n:::The quackery label has also been covered extensively. However, you haven't advanced any argument on this topic. Providing sources which talk about homeopathy's efficacy generally do not change a label used to describe homeopathy. To remove the label, we'd either need sourcing saying \"homeopathy is not quackery\" or we'd need to demonstrate a lack of sourcing which called homeopathy quackery. That issue has been beaten to death too, so I wouldn't suggest taking it up now. I'd suggest making improvements to the article (or another article) which aren't contentious for a while.

This is the meaning of the [[abstract]] of the study   you DO  know it summarizes and  expresses  the author's views and  saying that the review contradicts itself iIS original research which we are not suppose to be doing here. One can argue that contradictions can be detected in all negative reviews on homeopathy.

Even the authors contradicted  themselves  which they don't , we suppose to include '''every controversy or contradiction as long as it appears in a reliable source'''.  Furthermore I have produced 4 sources which depart from the current point of view wikipedia has adopted but they have also been rejected -  even the ones which state that the authors [http:\/\/www.thelancet.com\/journals\/lancet\/article\/PIIS0140-6736%2805%2967878-6\/fulltext DISAGREE  that homeopathy = placebo. since they don't agree wikipedia 's view].

First, it isn't a [[Systematic_review#Characteristics|systematic review]].  It doesn't state its search strategy.  It doesn't cite the reanalysis of the data from the 1997 Linde paper which considerably qualified its conclusion.  The qualifications of the conclusions of the other reviews are not some invention of mine, as you seem to be implying, but (as I have already pointed out) are right there in the papers themselves.  Kleijnen (1991) states: \"At the moment the evidence of clinical trials is positive but not sufficient to draw definitive conclusions because most trials are of low methodological quality and because of the unknown role of publication bias.\"  This is even reported in Table 1 of the Jonas Kaptchuk & Linde review (on page 395): \"Available evidence is positive but not sufficient to draw definitive conclusions\".  Similarly for the 2000 Cucherat review: \"There is some evidence that homeopathic treatments are more effective than placebo; however, the strength of this evidence is low because of the low methodological quality of the trials. Studies of high methodological quality were more likely to be negative than the lower quality studies.\"  These are not the unequivocal positive results that you want to present them as.  Additionally it does not, of course, take into account the negative result of the later Shang ''et al'' review.\n:For the particular conditions your quotation reports homoeopathy may be effective for: as I have already pointed out, the paper actually says that the evidence for postoperative ileus is inconclusive, not positive.  For influenza, the paper cites The Vickers ''et al'' Cochrane review on Oscillococcinum, which was withdrawn in 2009 and has now been replaced by [http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23235586 Mathie ''et al''] which concludes that \"There is insufficient good evidence to enable robust conclusions to be made about Oscillococcinum(\u00ae) in the prevention or treatment of influenza and influenza-like illness.\"  For allergies one of the sources used is Taylor ''et al'', which is a review of a series of small studies by the same team, and the article notes that \"a larger study using a similar protocol did not reproduce this clinical effect,\" the [http:\/\/content.karger.com\/produktedb\/produkte.asp?doi=210233 other source] for this states at the end of its conclusions that its \"results may be slightly biased\".  For childhood diarrhea the review relied on is a review of three studies by the same team, and the paper was unable to take into account the same team's [http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17034278 larger study] published in 2006 which found no effect of homoeopathy.  As for the systematic reviews, the paper has been overtaken by later publications reporting negative results.\n:2. If the paper itself disagrees with the abstract, we should rely on the paper and not the abstract.\n:3. You're citing one of the reviews cited by the Jonas review (the one on diarrhea); an editorial written by a prominent homoeopath; a paper that explicitly states that its results \"do neither prove that homeopathic medicines are superior to placebo nor do they prove the opposite\"; and a letter to the editor of the ''Lancet'' which states, in its only direct commet about the efficacy of homoeopathy, \"We agree that homoeopathy is highly implausible and that the evidence from placebo-controlled trials is not robust\".  These have all been gone over before.\n:4. The wikipedia article already states that there are some positive results, but accurately reports the scientific consensus that the totality of the evidence fails to show that homoeopathy works.  And you're citing that letter to the ''Lancet'' again.  It doesn't say what you think it says.\n:5. If you want later comments by the authors, how about Linde's comment about the 1997 review, [http:\/\/www.spiegel.de\/spiegel\/print\/d-71558786.html reported] by ''Der Spiegel'' in 2010: \"Wir k\u00f6nnen unsere damalige Schlussfolgerung so nicht mehr aufrechterhalten, denn die positiven Ergebnisse k\u00f6nnten auch durch Fehler in den Studien bedingt sein\" (\"We can no longer maintain our old conclusions as stated, since the positive results could be due to errors in the studies\").\n:6. If you want the article to imply that some researchers have come to conclusions that differ from the scientific consensus reported by the article, we will need published research by them that has concluded that homoeopathy works.

It is relatively well written throughout, but overall it is EXTREMELY repetitive.  So much so it becomes particularly monotinous to read.  It needs a structural overhaul and significant shortening to fix this, I think.  As I was reading, I couldn't help thinking I should stop reading the article, but thought there would be new information somewhere in the huge article.  Numerous quotes are repeated, scientific conclusions re-cited, succussion explained over and over again, the patent mathematical absurdity is explained ''over'' and ''over'' again.

Succussion is there because homoeopaths consider it to be an essential part of the preparation process.  Regarding the \"mathematical absurdity\", this is discussed twice in the article: the dilutions are explained in the section about the preparation of remedies, as is appropriate, and the \"absurdity\" is discussed in the section about plausibility, where it is clearly necessary to explain ''why'' the dilutions make homoeopathy implausible.

To be more clear;\n*First of all, the first paragraph in a lead should be about the article (or practice here) itself, not on others' opinions about it. The opinions of others (especially the scientific community) can be (must be) expressed in the lead. But not in the first paragraph. If not done so, it contradicts several principles such as:\n**[[WP:STRUCTURE]] - Article Structure: Care must be taken to ensure that the overall presentation is broadly neutral.\n**[[WP:WEIGHT]] - Undue Weight and\n**[[WP:IMPARTIAL]] - Impartial Tone: A neutral characterization of disputes requires presenting viewpoints with a consistently impartial tone.\n*There is another point. I've partially read and went through the sources ''supposedly'' claiming that '''''Scientific research has found homoeopathic remedies ineffective and their postulated mechanisms of action implausible'''''. This is [[WP:YESPOV|stating opinions as facts]]. The Turkish Wikipedia article on [[:tr:homeopati| homoeopathy]], using more or less the same sources, approximately says: '''''No scientific or clinical evidence has been found suggesting that homoeopathy has any benefit else than the placebo effect.''''' This is also what the sources says. [http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1046\/j.1365-2125.2002.01699.x\/abstract;jsessionid=535E6DFC37E6D6F5094F49EE779B4E86.d01t02 A systematic review of systematic reviews of homeopathy] say this:\n{{blurb}}(17 reviews, 11 of them independent) '''''failed to provide strong evidence in favour of homeopathy.''''' In particular, there was no condition which responds convincingly better to homeopathic treatment than to placebo or other control interventions. Similarly, there was no homeopathic remedy that was demonstrated to yield clinical effects that are convincingly different from placebo.{{blurbclose}}\n*Now, there is a huge difference with this and saying \"Scientific research has found homoeopathic remedies ineffective\".

The question, of course, is how? The lead currently summarizes all the important points (what Homeopathy is, how it works, where it came from, and its reception in the relevant communities).

Do you have time to reply?--[[User:Motorola12|Motorola12]] ([[User talk:Motorola12|talk]]) 05:37, 16 January 2013 (UTC)\n::::::::::Well, [[WP:FRINGE]] covers that a bit. It has to do with the quality of the source, whether it has been superseded by later research, and how it interplays with the rest of the literature. Lets say we have a source which makes a statement (\"the Earth is flat\"), which is contradicted by 90% or more of other scientific research. That is a minority or a fringe view. If later papers question the methods or conclusion of that source, it further calls it into question. The types of sources we want to present on science and pseudoscience topics are those which are reflective of a greater body of literature, not sources which make a unique statement on their own. For this source to be useful in the sense that you're proposing, we would want to see that it was largely accepted in the scientific community; we'd expect that it would be cited in future papers and systematic reviews, that its results would be repeated and expanded upon in future research, and that it would have an impact on the scientific consensus in some way. Editors have determined here that those things are not true of this source; it seems that other studies after this one came to the opposite conclusion and that the scientific consensus is still contrary to this one, as it apparently has made little impact. It has received criticism, it hasn't been cited prominently elsewhere, say in future systematic reviews over the last decade, and there are additional problems with the papers and authors that it discusses explicitly disclaiming the conclusions it draws. I am not saying that this determination that editors have made is the ''right'' one - I believe it to be, from what I've seen - but I am simply saying that it is the determination that was made given the available sourcing. To overturn that, we would need more, better, and recent sources which back this claim up on their own. Without that, policy ''dictates'' what we must do. Other sites and methods of publishing have different standards and work differently, but on wikipedia, we have to follow wikipedia's policies. &nbsp; &mdash; [[User:Mann_jess|<b>Jess<\/b>]]<span style=\"margin:0 7px;font-variant:small-caps;font-size:0.9em\">&middot; [[Special:Contributions\/Mann_jess|&Delta;]][[User_talk:Mann_jess|&hearts;]]<\/span> 06:21, 16 January 2013 (UTC)\n:::::::::::Jess firstly - this is not a unique statement on its own. This position is held but several reviews (see Linde for instance ) already cited who clarifying their conclusions of their systematic reviews  in the lancet,  say that homeopathy is NOT proven but it is  NOT only placebo. This view has been distorted in the article by the editors here. Second, by the  3 criteria you defined for classifying  minority fringe views (quality of the source, whether it has been superseded by later research, and how it interplays with the rest of the literature '''number of citation'''s )  you will be surprised to see how  it does not apply here.

Now with that said, if there is quality criticism of Lancet in a reliable secondary source we could use, then surely we can cover it. Criticism of one study doesn't seem appropriate to put in the lead, however. That means that we would need to determine how significant the criticism was in the literature, which will determine if we should 1) put lancet in the lead and the criticism in the body, or 2) move the lancet out of the lead where it can be covered in tandem with the criticism.

To me, a meta-analysis is an ''experiment'', i.e. no less \"primary\" than any other kind of paper.  However, in many (at least on paper, ''most'') published experiments, researchers are expected to share reagents and techniques to allow others to reproduce their work.

These guys... these guys won't name the 8 studies they finalized as the best ones?  Unbelievable.  My point is, if this were a true secondary source, an honest to God review article, I'd expect them to have paragraphs and paragraphs going through every study, explaining it, saying what they think about it, what its strengths and weaknesses are ... there's none of that.

And if the standard study says that 95% confidence is a significant result, well ... we'll have positive results 5% of the time.  That's true if it is completely ineffective, and it's true if it makes it a little bit longer but not enough for us to detect.

Our sources are crystal clear that mainstream science deems Homeopathy to be ineffective. What we're discussing is a minor issue only tangential to that topic, which is whether we should include a small quibble over one of the sources we use. I'm afraid that my resolve to include that criticism has diminished if it's true that the primary objection was clearly addressed by the authors in the same issue the criticism was published. I'd really want a secondary source to this debacle in order to summarize it adequately here. Do we have any secondary sources covering this? If so, they're more important than the initial criticism (a primary source on that criticism).

A doctor rather memorably describes homeopathy as \"nonsense on stilts\". (well, Wikipedia does aspire to \"brilliant writing\" - though I'm not sure we could easily get consensus to use this).

I considered changing it to \"the AMA considers...\", which is strongly and explicitly sourced many places.

There is no doubt that some (academic) sources describe homeopathy as quackery or sham. But there are also plenty of academic sources simply describing that homeopathy fails to produce any scientific evidence to support it and that it's explanatory framework makes no sense from scientific perspective. Now a ''good'' encyclopedic article is ''not'' written by simply picking the most extreme statements (supporting a personal POV) out there and compile them into an article, nevermind the lead. ''A good article strives first for a summary of the best sources in a neutral fashion without inflammatory language, that holds in particular for the lead.'' Now if some editors feel that some \"inflammatory descriptions\" are so common that the article should mention them, then that can be dealt with in separate section outside the lead. Personally I still fail to see the need for that as giving a (sourced) description along the line \"homeopathy fails to produce any scientific evidence to support it and that it's explanatory framework makes no sense from scientific perspective\" seems perfectly sufficient. Now I already suggested that people look up homeopathy in other reputable encyclopedias or medical reference works to get a feeling what such what a typical lead may look like and how they usually avoid the use of any inflammatory terms (see for instance [http:\/\/books.google.de\/books?id=UGVylX6g4i8C&pg=PA70 homeopathy in ''principles of ambulatory medicine''], [http:\/\/books.google.de\/books?id=6FPqDFx40vYC&pg=PA162 homeopathy in ''The Skeptic's Dictionary''], [http:\/\/www.britannica.com\/EBchecked\/topic\/270182\/homeopathy Britannica lead for homeopathy]).\n\nFinally an (imperfect) analogy to think about. Would use the term \"quackery\" or \"sham\" in the lead of an encyclopedic on a religious belief system (such as christianity, islam, buddhism, hinduism, ..) or in the lead for some (economic) philosophy just because you can find some reputable academic sources  calling them that (correctly so from their perspective)? Can you imagine any encyclopedia doing that or finding a consensus for such an approach? Probably not!\n\nIt is really important to keep in mind that we are trying to write an ''encyclopedic'' article. While it is perfectly fine to use some \"frank\" (and possibly inflammatory or polemic) language in a(n academic) journal or newspaper article to get a point across, it is usually ''not'' perfectly fine for an encyclopedic article, as they differ somewhat in goal and style. They're goal is not to get a particular point across, but to provide a summary in a neutral non-inflammatory tone.--[[User:Kmhkmh|Kmhkmh]] ([[User talk:Kmhkmh|talk]]) 23:17, 14 January 2013 (UTC)\n\n:Hi Kmhkmh. I think it may help to rephrase your first point: \"{{tq|There is no doubt that some (academic) sources describe homeopathy as quackery or sham <s>But<\/s> <u>'''and'''<\/u> there are also plenty of academic sources simply describing that homeopathy fails to produce any scientific evidence to support it and that it's explanatory framework makes no sense from scientific perspective.}}\" That the second type of sources exist does not somehow invalidate the first type; they are complimentary. Your proposed wording (beginning with \"''homeopathy fails to produce any scientific evidence...''\") is not synonymous with \"quackery\", and that's the problem here. When our sources say that homeopathy is quackery, they are saying something distinct from what our article describes elsewhere. The quackery label is pretty well sourced, indicating that the message is important to document, as it is prevalent in the literature. We are not using inflammatory language to discredit the subject, or indicating there is no dispute within CAM and the general populace (such as \"Homeopathy is quackery\"). We are documenting how homeopathy is viewed within the scientific and mainstream medical communities (\"the scientific community considers...\"). Choosing not to document that because a reader may be offended by the language would do our article a disservice. As a final note, we don't simply have a few sources which incidentally call Homeopathy quackery. We have sources which explicitly and repeatedly state that it is viewed that way within the relevant communities. See The Oxford Companion to United States History and The Encyclopedia of New York State, for just two examples of encyclopedic handling of the topic. &nbsp; &mdash; [[User:Mann_jess|<b>Jess<\/b>]]<span style=\"margin:0 7px;font-variant:small-caps;font-size:0.9em\">&middot; [[Special:Contributions\/Mann_jess|&Delta;]][[User_talk:Mann_jess|&hearts;]]<\/span> 00:25, 15 January 2013 (UTC)\n::I didn't suggest that second sources (without using quackery) contradict the first sources (using) quackery. ''But'' they do show that many (most?) reputable sources don't feel the need to use the term quackery. That's why i'm certainly not rephrasing that at all. And for documenting how the medical (scientific) community sees homeopathy you'd to weigh and summarize all sources ''without'' giving preference to most extreme ones and certainly ''not'' in the lead. As I said above already I personally still see no need for that term, but if editors feel strongly about it could be mention in a separate section but not in the lead (for reasons stated above already).\n\n::Also I'm personally I'm convinced that the scientific community sees at as a quackery\/sham (''a part'' of it based your sources certainly does), but the rest may see it as being without evidence and making little sense from the scientific perspective. Another problem with the terms like sham or quackery in particular in a single line like in the current lead that it doesn't provide inside at all, because it doesn't explain or provide inside what the alleged or real sham is. Who is committing the sham? The physician prescribing it? The pharmacist selling it? Even if they do that just for the placebo effect? Even if they state that there is no scientific evidence? In the single form at best they summarize an ''opinion'' of a certain group or individual as such, which is ''not'' the scientific community but just the author of the cited sources. This is btw. another reason to keep it out of the lead and cover it with more detail in separate section, that would provide some real inside and doing readers a real service.\n\n::As far as your 2 encyclopedias are concerned (New York State, History of the United States) from my perspective the Britannica clearly trumps them as far as reputation and probably expertise on that subject is concerned. So do the more specialized reference works I cited above (the skeptic Dictionary and the medical one).--[[User:Kmhkmh|Kmhkmh]] ([[User talk:Kmhkmh|talk]]) 02:19, 15 January 2013 (UTC)\n\n:::{{ec}}I think you missed part of my point. The two types of sources are not in conflict '''and''' not synonymous. If we had a source which said \"Obama is a democrat\" and another, \"Obama supports universal health care\", we cannot substitute the former with the latter just to avoid certain language. \"Democrat\" does not mean \"supports universal health care\"; \"Quackery\" does not mean your suggested wording.

Obama doesn't stand for the \"liberal community\" but just one voice or group on it. While you may claim Obama supports health care, claiming that all liberals\/the liberal community support universal health care is different thing. The point is, that it is rather safe to say that scientific community agrees on \"my description\" (as essentially the quackery and the non-quackery sources state agree on that). The quackery claim however is more extreme and ''not'' supported by all scientific sources but just by some. It is a matter of giving a description the scientific community ''universally'' shares and not just some of its members.\n::::As far as the lead is concerned - yes I'm essentially arguing for toning it down the language because imho that is a characteristic of a good encyclopedic lead (rather than a polemic). As I said I looked at the subject in various other encyclopedias (in German and English) and they usually refrain from using sham\/quackery (or German analogons). On that note the German wikipedia article (having a good article status) does fine without that as well. Ultimately it probably comes down to editorial discretion and there is no hard rule allowing to classify either version to \"right\" or \"wrong\".

Quackery\/sham sort of implies that there is no evidence (otherwise it would be no sham. So we have (different) claims A and B stated by members of the \"scientific community\" with A implying B. Hence we know that all those cited members do agree on B, ''but we do not know whether all those members agree on A'' (we just know they don't seem to contradict A explicitly). Hence B is much safer pick for the \"scientific community\" opinion (see also the general problem of equating opinions of individual members with the community in general).

They are either too weak to do so or simply do not make the claim. \nIf you believe the article should say this in the lead, the very first step toward that is bringing to this talk page a strong source - a position statement from one or more major scientific institutions ''saying'' expressly that \"the scientific community\" views homeopathy as quackery. If there is no such source, perhaps you can find one that says this or that scientific or medical organisation declares it to be quackery, and change your statement to reflect that. \"Be\" is important. Present tense. Every doctor knows where the profession stands with regard to CAM, and neither the medical profession nor the scientific community has a monolithic view, sadly. Pretending they do makes this encyclopedia look like a joke. I see you've now added Randi to support this assertion. Can you please post the page number and the exact words from Randi that you believe support this view? Randi does not speak for the medical profession but,depending on the sources he cites, and the rigor of his review of the medical and scientific communities' views on homeopathy - that is, provided it isn't just him spouting an opinion - his encyclopedia may be a reliable source for this claim.  --[[User:Anthonyhcole|Anthonyhcole]] ([[User talk:Anthonyhcole|talk]]) 07:21, 15 January 2013 (UTC)\n:Hmm, reviewing the quackery sources again I am inclined to agree; none of them really nail the quackery claim.

Those researchers just plugging away studying data quite probably just aren't on this spectrum at all. However it seems clear to me, from the sources, that when reputable professionals and scholars consider the question of quackery in relation to homeopathy, all their conclusions are clustered quite tightly together as being overwhelmingly negative.

But the article doesn't explain what that is, how it works, or how it is tested.  This is a deficiency that one of the experts here should fix.\n\nThe focus of my interest: is it conceivable that individualized homeopathy has been found to be effective because the therapist is able to mix in a composition which is actually ''not'' totally inert placebo (in other words, something like Zicam) and this is either not noticed by the researchers or not declared at all, i.e. a sort of \"illicit\" herbal or medical therapy? [[User:Wnt|Wnt]] ([[User talk:Wnt|talk]]) 16:54, 20 January 2013 (UTC)\n:\"Individualized\" homoeopathy involves the homoeopath having a long (often aroung 45 minute) consultation with the patient, during which they will talk not only about the particular symptoms that the patient wants resolved but other aspects of their health, personality, etc.  They will then prescribe a remedy that is supposedly tailored to all aspects of the patient, not just the particular disease they present with, so that two patients with the same disease may be given different remedies (or at least remedies with different names; it's a bit like the [[Technology_in_The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Nutrimatic_Drinks_Dispenser|Nutrimatic Drinks Dispenser]], which \"makes an instant but highly detailed examination of the subject's taste buds, a spectroscopic analysis of the subject's metabolism, and then sends tiny experimental signals down the neural pathways to the taste centres of the subject's brain to see what is likely to be well received. However, no-one knows quite why it does this because it then invariably delivers a cupful of liquid that is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea\").  It doesn't involve substituting non-homeopathic medicines.  \n:Individualized homoeopathy can be tested using a double blind protocol (although proponents of homoeopathy often claim it can't), simply by allowing a homoeopath to go through their usual routine and, for the control group, sustituting a placebo sugar pill for the prescribed sugar pill.  As I mentioned above, [http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9884175 the only systematic review of trials of this type of homoeopathy so far published] found that the results were no better than for non-individualized homoeopathy.\n:At least [http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21076131 one study] has found that the benefits of individualized homoeopathy are attributable to the consultation and not the the remedy, and it is often suggested that the long consultation may make individualized homoeopathy a particularly effective placebo.  However, [http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20129180 a review looking at this] found that \"placebo effects in RCTs on classical homeopathy did not appear to be larger than placebo effects in conventional medicine.\"  [[User:Brunton|Brunton]] ([[User talk:Brunton|talk]]) 17:40, 20 January 2013 (UTC)\n\n::Brunton is almsot correct : the entire conclusion of the study was : [http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9884175 The results of the available randomized trials suggest that individualized homeopathy has an effect over placebo.

Even for treating an acute, where the emphasis is on the specific ailment, there can be hundreds of remedies for that same ailment depending on the individual characteristcs, modalities and illness progression, as well as associated factors such as mental\/emotional symptoms. An acute consultation may take ten mins or an hour, a chronic consultation is anything up to two hours. Off the shelf homeopathy is common today, where there is choice of about 1 to 10 remedies for that ailment with the symptoms summarised in the guides or self help books to help in differentiation. In this latter style, low potencies ie up to 30c, are used as they are more effective for low grade ailments and accuracy of choice is less acute.\nIndividualised homeopathy can be tested, but the method Brunton describes would be wasteful in effort and numbers which is why its rejected.

Eg I use about 300 pills per bottle, some may use as low as 50 ... the actual remedy is rarely reflective of the dilution. Hence why potencies of remedies is the correct term, not dilutions. A 1x potency is likely to be dilute by between 500 to 5000, not 10.\"  So if I undestand Cjwilky correctly, on that basis a 3X preparation would involve a dilution of between 1:50,000 and 1:500,000, and one drop of that is shared between 50-300 pills.  And remember that the \"mother tincture\" (i.e. the initial material from which the dilutions are prepared) for a plant remedy is not going to be 100% plant material, but typically a tincture made by extraction of the plant material in an alcohol\/water mixture.  I don't think I've seen a RS that states all this explicitly though.  \n:As far as I can tell, it is the number of times the remedy has gone through the dilution\/succussion process that is important, not the actual amount of substance present.  [[User:Brunton|Brunton]] ([[User talk:Brunton|talk]]) 08:46, 24 January 2013 (UTC)\n::Thanks for your answer.  The way I parse that is a little different - that the nominal dilution is delivered as one drop per 50-300 pills ''or'' 50-500 (I presume) liquid drops, so that each pill or drop delivers I would suppose 0.1 to 1 microliters of nominal solution (though the drop size isn't defined and I shouldn't assume it is what I'd think), so that the composition of one 3X pill would be expected (assuming perfect mixing, which I highly doubt from this description) about the contents of 0.1 to 1 nanoliters of aconite extract.  But a RS would be very much necessary, to see for example how much leeway someone intending to deliver drug, like Zicam, would have to not do that final step of dilution - or, alternatively, how much wiggle room a homeopath company would have should someone run a test and not find even the smallest trace of aconite in a product it sells.

Seeing how so many rational, confident scientists assert there is ''no'' way homeopathy can work (despite multiple claims otherwise) I'd hope there'd be better sources to back up this view.

You cannot take the words of a few scientists as representing the views of the medical profession as a whole - that is making very wild assumptions for which there is no evidence.

You haven't contributed here. It seems you've just chosen to pile in for some grievance you feel, and merely added to what I say about the bully boy tactics employed by some skeptics in this article, as well as other articles on the skeptic mission noticeboard.\n:Yes, I'm calling a spade a shovel here. I'm not the only one who's done so. Others have given up due to bullying. Its about time something was sorted here. And just to be clear, I'm not claiming every skeptic is a bully, many have been positively helpful, many are constructive even though they are one sided - thats to be expected in a debate. Though it has to be said that very few if any have contributed evenly. The tendancy is for them to '''always''' look for one side of the argument. '''That''' is not being a sceptic, its about having an opinion and looking from there.\n:Thanks Alex for doing that, will check it out :) [[User:Cjwilky|Cjwilky]] ([[User talk:Cjwilky|talk]]) 20:48, 4 January 2013 (UTC)\n\n\nAs someone who's waded through many a meta-analysis, I don't actually differ from the conclusion that homeopathy=quackery.  However, I am not convinced that it is sensible, necessary or appropriate to include such a sweeping line as \"the medical community considers it quackery\" in the lead.  I'm not sure it is ''necessary'' because the rest of the article is sufficiently well-edited that readers are quite capable of reaching their own conclusions.  I doubt that it is ''appropriate'' as it appears to push a point of view - one with which I happen to concur, but this does not set a tone concomitant with sober neutrality.  I am concerned that it may not be ''sensible'' because its inclusion could reasonably be seen as discourteous, and that seems likely to inflame editorial tensions as well as presenting a written style out of place in an encyclopaedia.  Could we perhaps move on from the argument about who's most right and edit this one line in the interests of Wikipedia's quality? [[User:John Snow II|John Snow II]] ([[User talk:John Snow II|talk]]) 00:38, 8 January 2013 (UTC)\n: I agree. In general it is a good idea to pursue less loaded and more neutral formulations in the lead. I.e. the lead should state that the medical establishment\/academic medicine disregards homeopathy and considers it as a part of \"alternative medicine\" but there is no need to use the term \"quackery\" as such. A good comparison might be to look up homeopathy in some encyclopedia\/medical reference work, I'm pretty sure the term quackery won't be used there at all (see for instance: [http:\/\/www.britannica.com\/EBchecked\/topic\/270182\/homeopathy Britannica lead]). We need a similar encyclopedic language here and not sourced polemics for or against homeopathy.\n \n:Another thing to consider is that the term \"medical community\" is dangerous as in different publication\/sources the term might be used differently (which may not be transparent to readers without background knowledge in the field). The medical community in the sense of practicing and publishing (university educated) physicians contain a significant number of people using alternative medicine (for complimentary treatments, for placebo effects, \"holistic\" approaches and occasionally even because they \"believe\" in it), who are hence unlikely to use the term \"quackery\". However if you restrict the \"medical community\" to the conventional academic medicine (in German: \"Schulmedizin\"), then the term is more appropriate as a general view of the community.--[[User:Kmhkmh|Kmhkmh]] ([[User talk:Kmhkmh|talk]]) 23:19, 10 January 2013 (UTC)\n\n::Thanks for that helpful response, Kmhkmh.  Would you or other editors like to collaborate on arriving at a better wording?  My broad sense is that any discussion of quackery could simply be moved to a later, relevant part of the text (perhaps detailing how homeopathy has been critically received by conventional medicine). [[User:John Snow II|John Snow II]] ([[User talk:John Snow II|talk]]) 23:42, 10 January 2013 (UTC)\n:::I may be able help in proofreading or commenting on suggestions, but I don't have time to actively participate in a larger rewrite myself and this topic isn't really my primary area of expertise either. I agree with you that the term quackery if other editors insist on it should be handled in a later section but not the lead. In addition I really recommend some of the involved editors here to look up homeopathy in other encyclopedia to see what less polemic and more neutral description (including) criticism looks like. People need to able to take step back from their personal convictions about homeopathy and focus on writing an appropriate ''encyclopedic'' article rather than insisting on the article reflecting their personal convictions.--[[User:Kmhkmh|Kmhkmh]] ([[User talk:Kmhkmh|talk]]) 00:24, 11 January 2013 (UTC)\n\nJust an additional note. The subject of this question (\"quackery in the lead\") is apparently covered by the FAQ (see question\/answer 11) already and supposedly some earlier consensus of editors. Interestingly enough the answer is '''no''', essentially for the reason I outlined above as well (no inflammatory language, neutral tone).--[[User:Kmhkmh|Kmhkmh]] ([[User talk:Kmhkmh|talk]]) 19:24, 12 January 2013 (UTC)\n\n:Well, not precisely. The FAQ entry documents that we shouldn't, ourselves, call Homeopathy quackery, but that we should document how it is seen (i.e. quackery) within the scientific and medical community. For instance, \"Homeopathy is quackery\" is not appropriate. \"The AMA considers homeopathy to be quackery\" is. I appreciate you both contributing to the topic, but this issue has been worn down so much with so much repetition, I doubt anyone is going to read or respond to more messages in this section. Would you mind starting another section so we can start discussion fresh? Thanks. &nbsp; &mdash; [[User:Mann_jess|<b>Jess<\/b>]]<span style=\"margin:0 7px;font-variant:small-caps;font-size:0.9em\">&middot; [[Special:Contributions\/Mann_jess|&Delta;]][[User_talk:Mann_jess|&hearts;]]<\/span> 20:42, 12 January 2013 (UTC)\n\n::The point being raised is that it isn't good to have an inflammatory term in the lead, and actually the references don't support the current use, thats an extrapolation you have made Jess. This issue has not been processed. If you look above you can see how it goes - discussion followed quickly by the skeptics claiming a concensus has been reached when in fact it hasn't. Par for the course in this article, unfortunately. The preceding sentence does say enough, the quackery sentence is not adding anything, and makes the article look one sided from the off. [[User:Cjwilky|Cjwilky]] ([[User talk:Cjwilky|talk]]) 01:12, 14 January 2013 (UTC)\n:::I read the FAQ a bit differently as otherwise it would just reiterate the basic rule for source and WP:OR\/personal opinion. Note something not being sourced has no place in lead or the article to begin with, the same holds of personal opinion of an WP editor. So it seems rather pointless to point out that his is true for the case of inflammatory language as well, as it obviously holds for any language.--[[User:Kmhkmh|Kmhkmh]] ([[User talk:Kmhkmh|talk]]) 22:31, 14 January 2013 (UTC)\nI agree with most of whats been said above by John Snow and Kmhkmh above. The lead is inflammatory, very badly sourced and the discussion of this by other eds is negligable. It seems some eds have a mission to keep such words in the lead, their editing is far from neutral.

He is known for his ''Monument to Dante'' (1857-1865) in the [[Piazza Santa Croce]], [[Florence]], and for the [[Prince Mihailo Monument]] in the center of [[Serbia]]n capital city [[Belgrade]]. \n\n== Biography ==\nIn 1833, he enrolled in the Institute of Fine Arts of [[Ravenna]], his birthplace, under [[Ignazio Sarti]].<ref>[http:\/\/www.treccani.it\/enciclopedia\/enrico-pazzi_(Enciclopedia-Dantesca)\/ Enciclopedia Dantesca (1970)], entry for Treccani enciclopedia, entry by Camillo Semenzato.<\/ref> He was fired after a angry outburst where he destroyed one of his incomplete works at the eve of the yearly exhibition. With the help of the cardinal Legate of the city, [[Luigi Amat di San Filippo e Sorso|Luigi Amat]], he was readmitted to the Academy.<ref>[https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=Tt4YAAAAYAAJ Ricordi d'arte], by Enrico Pazzi, (autobiography),Tipografia Cooperativa, Via Monalda #1, Florence (1887), pages 11-15.<\/ref> With a stipend from the Academy, he moved to Florence and worked under the mentorship (1845-1851) of [[Giovanni Dupr\u00e8]]. Enrico opened a studio on Via dei Maccheroni with fellow artist from Ravenna, [[Luigi Majoli]].\n\n== Monument to Dante ==\n[[File:Dante Alighieri Florence Firenze JBU01.JPG|thumb|Monument to Dante, Florence]]\n[[File:Piazza savonarola, statuta di enrico pazzi, 01.JPG|thumb|left|[[Monument to Savonarola at Piazza Savonarola|Monument to Savonarola, Florence]]]]\nIn the early 1850s, a project for a statue of Dante for a piazza in Ravenna was declined. Pazzi subsisted on small private projects for tomb monuments and house decorations. He completed for Dupre a commission for a nativity scene, destined for the Signora Bianchi of Siena, however, had difficulty getting paid.<ref>Pazzi, page 46-48<\/ref> \n\nIn the 1857-59, a move was made to complete the Dante statue, but now for Florence. The patriotic Pazzi recalls an unfortunate episode when the [[Prince Leopold, Count of Syracuse]] (brother of the King of Naples) visited the studio accompanied by the interior minister of the Grand Duke, [[Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Leopold II]]. The visiting Prince inquired why Dante was surrounded by beasts. Pazzi indicated the lions were the ''Marzocchi'', long a symbol of Medici Florence. However, when asked why the eagle did not have a double head, the symbol of the [[Habsburg dynasty]], Pazzi impertinently replied that this was a Roman Eagle, arising from the ashes of the fallen Roman Empire. With this, the retinue left. Pazzi's statue would take nearly half a decade to rise in the piazza.<ref>Pazzi, page 56.<\/ref>\n\nPazzi's [[Monument to Savonarola in Piazza Savonarola|Monument to Savonarola]] would also have a tortuous and controversial route to finding a home in Florence.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Pazzi, Enrico\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Italian sculptor\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = June 20, 1818\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = Ravenna, Emilia-Romagna, Italy\n| DATE OF DEATH     = 1899\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = Florence, Italy\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pazzi, Enrico}}\n[[Category:1818 births]]\n[[Category:1899 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Ravenna]]\n[[Category:19th-century Italian sculptors]]\n[[Category:Enrico Pazzi]]","timestamp":"20160410104204","user-timestamp":"20150410104204"},{"title":"Talk:Kuhsalar-e Sofla","content":"{{WikiProjectBannerShell|1=\n{{WikiProject Geography|class=stub|importance=low}}\n{{WikiProject Iran |importance=|class=stub}}\n{{WikiProject Cities|class=stub|importance=low}}\n{{Image requested|in=Iran}}\n}}","timestamp":"20160410104205","user-timestamp":"20150410104205"},{"title":"User talk:100loves","content":"== March 2011 ==\n[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Welcome to Wikipedia.

Instead, when a file transfer is initiated, clients connect directly to each other (using the standard public [[Internet Protocol|IP]] network).  This traffic is susceptible to blocking\/shaping\/tracking by an ISP or any other opportunistic middle-man.\n\nAs with all [[Distributed Transient Network|decentralized]] networks, the Kad network requires no official or common servers. As such, it cannot be disabled by shutting down a given subset of key [[node (networking)|node]]s. While the decentralization of the network prevents a simple shut-down, traffic analysis and deep packet inspection will more readily identify the traffic as P2P due to the high variable-destination packet throughput.  The large packet volume typically causes a reduction in available CPU and\/or network resources usually associated with P2P traffic.\n\n==Clients==\n\n===Client Search===\nThe Kad network supports searching of files by name and a number of secondary characteristics such as size, extension, bit-rate, and more. Features vary based on client used.\n\n===Major Clients===\nOnly a few major clients currently support the Kad network implementation.  However, they comprise over 80% of the user base and are probably closer to 95% of ed2k installations.\n\n* [[eMule]]: An [[open source]] [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] client which is the most popular, with 80% of network users. It also runs on Linux using the [[Wine (software)|Wine]] libraries.\n:There are a number of minor variants, or forks, of eMule which support the same basic features as eMule itself. They include: [[aMule]] (A Linux client similar to eMule) and eMule Mods (not [[eMule Plus]]), possibly others.\n* [[aMule]]: An [[open source]] client popular among [[GNU\/Linux]] Operating Systems. Currently aMule (officially) supports a wide variety of platforms and operating systems.\n* [[MLDonkey]]: An [[open source]], [[cross-platform]] client that runs on many platforms and supports numerous other file-sharing protocols as well.\n* [[iMule]]: An anonymous, [[open source]], [[cross-platform]] client.

In it, [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] wrote of the city:\n\"And this Song of the Vine,\nThis greeting of mine,\nThe winds and the birds shall deliver,\nTo the Queen of the West,\nIn her garlands dressed,\nOn the banks of the Beautiful River.\"<ref>http:\/\/library.cincymuseum.org\/cinfaq7menu.htm<\/ref> In the 1850s, Cincinnati was the largest westernmost inland city from the East Coast.\n\nCincinnati for many years was known as \"Porkopolis\", a name perhaps not much coveted by the citizens of the Queen City but justified possibly by the large pork interests centered here for several decades.<ref>{{cite book | url=https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=-hB6AAAAMAAJ&dq=cincinnati%20the%20queen%20city%20clarke&pg=PA334#v=onepage&q=cincinnati%20the%20queen%20city%20clarke&f=false | title=Cincinnati, the Queen City, 1788-1912, Volume 2 | publisher=The S. J. Clarke Publishing Company | year=1912 | accessdate=2013-05-20 | author=Clark, S. J. | pages=334}}<\/ref>\n\nNewer nicknames such as \"The 'Nati\" are emerging and are attempted to be used in different cultural contexts such as the \"hip-hop\" scene and more casual settings.  For example, a local [[litter]]-prevention campaign uses the slogan \"Don\u2019t Trash the 'Nati.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.keepcincinnatibeautiful.org\/Programs\/dttn.html|title=Don\u2019t Trash the \u2018Nati}}, Keep Cincinnati Beautiful website, accessed May 3, 2008<\/ref>\n\nSome, particularly those of older generations, still use a regional pronunciation of the city's name where the final vowel (\"I\") is short as opposed to long.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Phonetically, this variation would be spelled [sin-suh-nat-uh] instead of the generally accepted [sin-sin-nat-ee].  This has seen less usage in recent years.\n\nThe nickname, \"The City of Seven Hills,\" is not now a literal description of the city, as there are many more than seven hills in modern Cincinnati. When the city was younger and smaller, the June 1853 edition of the ''West American Review'', \"Article III--Cincinnati: Its Relations to the West and South\" described and named seven specific hills.  The hills form a crescent around the city: [[Mount Adams, Ohio|Mount Adams]], [[Walnut Hills, Cincinnati|Walnut Hills]], [[Mount Auburn, Cincinnati, Ohio|Mount Auburn]], Vine Street Hill, College Hill, Fairmont (now rendered Fairmount), and Mount Harrison (now known as Price Hill). The name refers to ancient Rome that is reputed to be built on seven hills.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of city nicknames in Ohio]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:City nicknames by city name|Cincinnati]]\n[[Category:Culture of Cincinnati, Ohio]]","timestamp":"20160410104245","user-timestamp":"20150410104245"},{"title":"Talk:Orobena","content":"{{LepidopteraTalk|class=stub|importance=low}}","timestamp":"20160410104246","user-timestamp":"20150410104246"},{"title":"Tz'utujil","content":"'''Tz'utujil''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u1d57|s|u\u02d0|t|\u0259|h|i\u02d0|l}}),  '''Tzutujil''', '''Tzutuhil''', '''Sutujil''', and '''Zutuhil''' may refer to\n* [[Tz'utujil people]], an ethnic subgroup of the Maya\n* [[Tz'utujil language]], spoken by those people\n\n{{disamb}}","timestamp":"20160410104246","user-timestamp":"20150410104246"},{"title":"Talk:Simple Minds concert tours","content":"{{Concert Tours}}","timestamp":"20160410104247","user-timestamp":"20150410104247"},{"title":"File:Manora Abandoned Ships 1100611.jpg","content":"== Summary ==\n[[Manora]] or Manoro (in Sindhi) is a small island (2.5 km\u00b2) located just south of the Port of [[Karachi]] in [[Pakistan]].

But then I will get the t-shirt. :-) In the meantime I'm going to see if I can write something in Wikipedia on database theory, which is my real area of expertise.'' -- Jan Hidders\n\n----\nI disagree with you regarding removing HTML markup from Wikipedia. There are 2 main reasons:\n\n# HTML is a World standard, even if no browser that I am aware of completely supports it. However, this does give users (e.g. me) a chance to develop articles off-line, previewing them in their browsers, before uploading them later (copy+paste!).\n# HTML syntax, with syntactical elements all delimited by &lt; &gt; is probably easier to parse than the multiple character markup you propose.\n\nI am considering expending effort on (n\/t\/g)roff macros to enable the same source file to be used to generate PostScript or HTML... [[User:Rcingham|Rcingham]]\n\n: ''First, let me reassure you, the issue is as dead as a [[Dodo]] if only because far too much [[HTML]] has now been allowed already and it will be nearly impossible to come up with a reasonable Wiki-markup to replace it. However, I still feel that allowing HTML tags is probably one of the biggest mistakes in the history of [[Wikipedia]]. Let me give you a short summary of the arguments. (1) HTML tags make Wikipedia less accessible. The whole reason that the [[WikiWiki]] concept and its mark-up was introduced when HTML was already around was because HTML can actually get quite complicated and is not trivial to understand for people who aren't used to programming and\/or creating web pages. If you're interested read the excellent book written by the originator of the WikiWiki idea: [[Ward Cunningham]] on what makes WikiWiki tick. The key word is simplicity. (2) HTML tags make parsing harder. The original wiki mark-up could be parsed with some simple [[regular expression]] matching but since HTML tags can be nested you need more complex code for this because you now need something closer to a parser for a [[context-free grammar]]. If we had no HTML tags we also wouldn't have to bother about filtering out unwanted tags or checking if the present HTML is well-formed. It would have kept the parsing code simpeler, less buggier, and more efficient. Your assumption that HTML tags are easier to parse may be true, but parsing a HTML document is another matter. If you don't believe me, try coming up with a context-free grammar for the syntax and semantics of the pages of Wikipedia. That's still something that needs to be done. (3) There are some other small things such as that having two mark-ups for the same thing can be confusing (it makes people wonder what the difference is between === and &lt;h3&gt; ) but the first two points are really the most important ones. -- [[User:Jan Hidders|Jan Hidders]] 13:44 Jul 23, 2002 (PDT)''\n\n----\nThanks for your comments, two years late... -- Leandro Dutra.\n==Main namespace cleanup==\nHeya, I've moved [[Jan Hidders\/todo]]  to [[User:Jan Hidders\/old-todo]].

Since the municipal reform in 1974, the nearby villages of Deute, Dissen, Dorla, Gleichen, Maden and Obervorsch\u00fctz have become parts of the municipality.\n\n==Geography==\nGudensberg is situated in the district of [[Schwalm-Eder-Kreis]], [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], at the southeasternmost edge of the Habichtswald Nature Park, about {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} south of [[Kassel]] and {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Fritzlar]].\n\nThe town's municipal area borders to the north and northeast on [[Ederm\u00fcnde]], to the east on constituent communities of [[Felsberg, Germany|Felsberg]] which lie along the lower reaches of the river [[Eder]]. South and southeast of the river Ems lie further parts of Felsberg. To the south, southwest, and west are constituent communities of Fritzlar. To the northwest, Gudensberg's community of Gleichen abuts [[Niedenstein]]; in this direction, behind the Odenberg (elevation = {{convert|381|m|abbr=on}}), rise the ''Langenberge'', (a low mountain range), that belong to the Habichtswald Nature Park.\n\n==History==\n\n===Gudensberg===\nIn the area around Gudensberg, many [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] and early historic finds have shown that the area was inhabited by people now known as the [[Chatti]]. On the Lamsberg, finds from the [[R\u00f6ssen culture]] have been unearthed. In 1938, between the Odenberg and Gudensberg, a [[Linear Pottery culture]] settlement from about 4000 [[Before Christ|BC]] and an [[Iron Age]] settlement were discovered. At the ''Kassler Kreuz'', a graveyard with cremated remains from about 1000 [[Before Christ|BC]]<!---from the [[Urnfield culture]]?---> was discovered when a railway was built in 1899.\n\nIn the 10th Century, the ''Hof Wodensberg'', a farm in Gudensberg, was run using three-field [[crop rotation]]. Gudensberg itself had its first mention in documents in 1121. The town's name is presumably derived from an older form, Wotansberg, after the god [[W\u014ddanaz]], who was worshiped as the highest god by the Chatti in Old Germanic times. In the [[Middle Ages]], a castle was built on the hill and was named the Obernburg. It was the seat of Hessian regional counts (''Gaugrafen''). From 1122 to 1247, Gudensberg belonged to the [[Landgrave]]s of [[Thuringia]], and the place experienced its heyday, with its first town wall built between 1170 and 1180, and its first mention as a town in 1254 with a town constitution at the turn of the 13th Century.\n\nWith the partition of Thuringia, Gudensberg fell to the Landgraviate of Hesse, and in 1277, [[Henry I, Landgrave of Hesse|Henry I]] was proclaimed the first Landgrave of Hesse on the Mader Heide (heath) near Gudensberg.  In 1300, Landgrave Henry I moved his residence from Gudensberg to [[Kassel]] and Gudensberg lost its political and administrative importance. In 1324, however, Gudensberg was still being mentioned as the \"Capital of Nyderlandt\". In 1365, the [[Hospital]] ''Heiliger Geist'' (Holy Ghost Hospital) for [[Leprosy|lepers]] was founded.\n\nIn the many feuds between the [[Archbishopric of Mainz]] and the Landgraviate of Hesse, Gudensberg was one of Hesse's main bases and repeatedly suffered damage as a result. In 1387, Gudensberg and the Wenigenburg (castle) \u2014\u2013 but not the Obernburg \u2014\u2013 were sacked by troops from Mainz.  Fiery catastrophes befell the town a number of times. In 1587, the town was laid waste through carelessness. In 1640, during the [[Thirty Years' War]], the town was sacked by Imperial troops; in this plundering, the philosopher and theologian Daniel Angelocrater lost all his belongings.\n\n[[Johan t'Serclaes, Count of Tilly|Tilly]] convened a ''[[Landtag]]'' of Hessian towns in Gudensberg in 1626. In 1709, Landgrave Karl of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel) organized excavations in the ''Mader Heide'' which brought to light remnants of Iron Age settlements. In the [[Seven Years' War]], the still partly preserved Obernburg was heavily damaged by bombardment in 1761 by [[United Kingdom|British]] troops under [[John Manners, Marquess of Granby|John Manners]]'s leadership. In 1806, [[France|French]] troops plundered and thoroughly destroyed what was left of the Obernburg. The town gates were torn down because they were a traffic hazard in 1823.\n\n===Deute===\nDeute's first mention in documents goes back to 1314. A house dating from 1665 is still standing today. In the 18th Century, there was a working [[brown coal]] mine in Deute.\n\n===Dissen===\nDissen's first mention in documents goes back to 1061.\n\n===Dorla===\nDorla, which lies on the Ems, had its first mention in documents in 1040. The village church was consecrated in 1718.\n\n===Maden===\nAt the time when the [[Chatti]] lived in the area, Maden was a main town, and at the [[Mader Stein]] they held their [[Thing (assembly)|things]]. Maden's first mention as ''Mathanon in pago Hassorum'' comes from about 800 in the ''Bresiarium Lulli'', making Maden one of Hesse's oldest villages (at least by the measure of documentary mention) and in 2000 it celebrated 1225 years of existence. In 1046, Maden was mentioned as ''Madanum'', in 1061 as ''Madena'' and in 1295 as ''major Maden''. Emperor [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], the Great, awarded Maden to the Archbishop of Mainz.\n\nCount Werner IV of Maden founded the Benedictine Monastery of Breitenau near [[Guxhagen]] in 1113. After Werner's death in 1121, rule and ownership rights passed to Count [[Giso IV, Count of Gudensberg|Giso IV]] from the ''Burg Hollende''. Lower jurisdiction was held as of the 14th Century by ''Alb. Lugelin'', ''Gerlach von Linne'' and the ''von Holzsadel'' family.\n\nMaden was the Seat of the County of Hesse. In 1325 it was called: \"County and state court of Hesse, that one calls the court of Maden\". The [[Wotanstein (Hesse)|Wodanstein]] in Maden was first mentioned in 1408.\n\nBetween Maden and Gudensberg lies the historically important ''Mader Heide'' (heath).\n\n===Obervorsch\u00fctz===\n[[Image:Fachwerkh\u00e4user in Obervorsch\u00fctz.JPG|thumb|Half-timbered houses in Obervorsch\u00fctz]]\n[[Image:Emsbachbr\u00fccke Obervorsch\u00fctz.JPG|thumb|Bridge over the Emsbach in Obervorsch\u00fctz]]\nThe find of a stone axe in the area bears witness to a very early culture settling in the Obervorsch\u00fctz area about 3000 BC. A late-Roman era metalwork find was a Roman belt mount bearing Germanic imagery indicating a skilled artisan in the area.<ref>http:\/\/www.archeurope.com\/_texts\/00106.pdf<\/ref> However, the village's first documentary mention, under the name ''Burrisuzze'', did not come until 1074. It was later mentioned in 1275 as ''villa superior Vorskutheund'' and in 1357 as ''Obirm Vorsch\u00fctz''.\n\n==Politics==\n\n===Town Council===\nThe Town Council consists of 31 representatives: \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Parties\n! %<br \/>2011\n!

On a [[Mountain pass|saddle]] below the Obernburg, a tower that was part of the town's old defences still stands. From the {{convert|306|m|abbr=on}} high hill there is an outstanding view across the heath, to the [[Mader Stein]], to the Nenkel and to the Odenberg (and other mountains).\n\nVarious historic buildings are to be found in the town core, mostly [[Timber framing|half-timbered]] houses, among them the old ''Amtshaus'' with its [[Renaissance]] porch, the rectory from 1642, the ''Renthof''<!---Pensioners' residence?---> built in 1643, and the town's oldest building, the ''Ackerb\u00fcrgerhaus'', built in 1596. The [[Protestantism|Evangelical]] church ''St. Margarete'' is a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] structure from the 14th century, with additions and renovations in the 15th and 16th centuries. On Kasseler Stra\u00dfe, at the corner of Fritzlarer Stra\u00dfe, is the Hospital of the Holy Ghost, founded in 1365 for lepers, but renovated many times up until the 18th Century. The [[Classicism|Classicist]] town hall dates from 1839. Also in the Old Town is the Old Cemetery with historic gravestones from the 18th and 19th Centuries. Of interest is a [[horse hoof]] print on a stone in the churchyard wall. It is said that [[Charlemagne]]'s horse made this mark when it stamped on this stone in the now-abandoned village of Karlskirchen, after his rider had just fought a battle there. The legend has it that the horse created the [[Glisborn]] in doing so, or though previous legends exist as well.\n\n===Natural monuments===\nDissen's most notable landmark is a [[basalt]] knoll, the [[Scharfenstein (Hesse)|Scharfenstein]], which attracts a lot of climbers because of the difficult and vaired climbs available. There is also a [[gallery grave]]. Less notable, but legendary, is the [[Glisborn]] (or sometimes called ''Gli\u00dfborn''), a [[Spring (water)|spring]] north of the [[Scharfenstein (Hesse)|Scharfenstein]] that was a holy place to the [[Chatti]], who believed it had healing powers, and that it was of godly origins. In the Gudensberg Town Forest lies the Lautarius Grave, an archaeological site from the [[New Stone Age]], built by the [[Wartberg culture]].\n\nScenic mountaintops near Gudensberg include the [[Mader Stein]] at the edge of the Maden Heath (Mader Heide), the Odenberg, the Nenkel and the Wartberg.\n\n==Economy and infrastructure==\n\n===Transport===\nGudensberg lies on Autobahn [[Bundesautobahn 49|A 49]]. An express busline joins Gudensberg with [[Kassel]] and [[Fritzlar]], and at times with [[Bad Wildungen]] and [[Frankenberg, Hesse|Frankenberg]].\n\n=== ''Grifte-Gudensberger Kleinbahn'' ===\n[[Image:Bahnhof-Gudensberg.jpg|thumb|280px|Gudensberg's former railway station (2005)]]\nThe ''Kleinbahn'' was a \"small\" [[railway]], small in the operational sense; the track was [[standard gauge]] and the trains full-sized. Work on it began in 1898, and the {{convert|7.72|km|abbr=on}} long line, with four stations was opened on 15 July 1899. The service ran as follows:\n* Grifte, 0.00&nbsp;km\n* Haldorf, 2.58&nbsp;km\n* Dissen, 4.25&nbsp;km\n* Gudensberg, 7.72&nbsp;km\nPassenger services on the line were terminated on 31 December 1954. Thereafter, only a packaging machine manufacturer from Gudensberg used the line to ship his wares, and even then only weekly. The tracks were removed in 1980, and the railway embankment is nowadays used as a cycling and hiking path.\n\n===Established businesses===\nBig Drum, GTS Stanztechnik, Weber Netze, DPD Lager 34, Stolle.\n\n==Education==\nThe town has three [[kindergarten]]s, two [[primary school]]s (one of which is in Obervorsch\u00fctz), one [[comprehensive school]] with a school [[observatory]], a special school and a media centre.\n\n==Sons and daughters of the town==\n* Hugo Brunner, librarian and historian\n* Daniel Angelocrater, theologian\n* Ulrich Sonnemann, philosopher\n* Conrad Mel, theologian and [[teacher|pedagogue]]\n* Helmut Reitze, journalist\n* Thomas Freudenstein, footballer\n* Otto Kastl, footballer\n* Heinrich Reuter (1905\u20131984), painter\n\n==Literature==\n* Eduard Brauns: ''Wander- und Reisef\u00fchrer durch Nordhessen und Waldeck'', A.

Listed at 6' 1\", 180 lb., Ashby batted and threw [[right-handed]]. He was born in [[Kansas City, Missouri]].\n\nAshby attended [[Park Hill High School]] in Kansas City and played baseball with the [[Crowder Roughriders baseball|Crowder Roughriders]] at [[Crowder College]]. He was signed as an undrafted [[free agent]] in {{By|1986}} by the Phillies, with whom he made his Major League debut in 1991.\n\nOn June 15, 1991, Ashby struck out three batters on nine pitches in the fourth inning of a 3\u20131 loss to the [[Cincinnati Reds]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http:\/\/www.baseball-reference.com\/boxes\/PHI\/PHI199106150.shtml |title=Baseball Reference Box Score}}<\/ref> Ashby became the 15th [[National League]] pitcher and the 24th pitcher in Major League history to accomplish the [[Pitchers who have struck out three batters on nine pitches|nine-strike\/three-strikeout half-inning]]. He was acquired by the Colorado Rockies in the 1993 expansion draft, but after compiling an 0\u20134 record with an 8.50 [[Earned run average|ERA]], he was dealt to the San Diego Padres at the end of the season.<ref name=BaseballLibrary>{{cite web |url=http:\/\/www.baseballlibrary.com\/baseballlibrary\/ballplayers\/A\/Ashby_Andy.stm |title= Baseball Library Chronology}}<\/ref>\n\nDespite injuries to his shoulder, elbow and back, Ashby saw the greatest success of his career with the Padres. His most productive season came in {{By|1998}}, when he helped the Padres reach the [[1998 World Series|World Series]] with a 17\u20139 record and a 3.34 ERA. He was also a member of the 1998 and 1999 [[MLB All-Star Game|National League All-Star]] team.

Ashby had been touted as a potential ace for the struggling Phillies pitching staff. However, he pitched poorly, going 4\u20137 with a 5.68 ERA. He was sent to the Atlanta Braves midseason, where he helped the team reach the playoffs with an 8\u20136 record and a 4.13 ERA.<ref name=BaseballLibrary\/>\n\nAshby spent the next three years with the Los Angeles Dodgers, going 14\u201323 while posting a 4.31 ERA.

Throughout the 1950s, they used [[Gibson J-200]] guitars, some customized with dual [[pickguard]]s. \n\nIn 1962, Gibson collaborated with The Everly Brothers to produce the ''Everly Brothers Flattop''. This [[flat top guitar]] featured a thin J-185-style body and an adjustable [[bridge (instrument)|bridge]]. The guitar was unusual in that it featured star-shaped [[inlay (guitar)|inlays]] on the [[rosewood]] [[fretboard]], and it had a large double tortoise grain pickguard, which covered most of the top of the body. As the pickguard covered most of the [[Sound board (music)|top]] of the guitar, it limited the [[vibration]] of the top, thus limiting the sound of the guitar. The standard [[Wood finishing|finish]] on the guitar was black, though a few models were natural or [[sunburst]] finish. The Everly Brothers Flattop was discontinued in 1972, but was reissued as the ''Gibson J-180'' in the mid-1980s. \n\nThe Everly Brothers used these guitars throughout the 1960s, both live and in the [[recording studio]]. [[Paul McCartney]] also owns and plays an ''Everly Brothers model'', as did many influential artists including [[George Harrison]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Cat Stevens]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Keith Richards]],  [[Jimmy Page]], [[Roger Daltrey]], [[Billie Joe Armstrong]], [[Billy Idol]], [[Sharleen Spiteri]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and many more.  [[Albert Lee]] is the owner of [[Don Everly]]'s original ''Everly Brothers Model''. Lee was presented with the guitar by Don Everly himself. Before Gibson announced the Everly Brothers Model, the brothers used Gibson SJ-200s.  The guitar that Don gave to Albert Lee is not an 'Everly Brothers Model', but a 1958 SJ_200 finished in black with cream double pickguards.\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite web\n   |last=Leonard |first= Michael \n   | date      = 2011-06-28\n   | title     = 20 Essential Facts About The Gibson J-180\n   | url       = http:\/\/www2.gibson.com\/news-lifestyle\/features\/en-us\/gibson-j-180-0628-2011.aspx\n   | work      = News-Lifestyle, gibson.com\n  }}\n\n{{The Everly Brothers}}\n\n[[Category:Acoustic guitars]]\n[[Category:The Everly Brothers]]","timestamp":"20160410104302","user-timestamp":"20150410104302"},{"title":"Talk:The Embassy Visual Effects","content":"{{WikiProject Animation|class=Stub|importance=Low|Canadian-animation=yes|Canadian-animation-importance=Low}}\n{{Film|class=Stub|Canadian-task-force=yes|Filmmaking-task-force=yes}}","timestamp":"20160410104302","user-timestamp":"20150410104302"},{"title":"User talk:166.203.0.99","content":"Please consider starting an account, because I'm not even sure you still have the same IP as I'm writing this (which is why I'll replicate this on my talk page).

I have separate problems with the two cats for CPSU members and Bolsheviks, which I hadn't noticed before: the former is most likely redundant to Soviet politicians, the latter is frankly absurd (the term is as vague as to mean anything, and its overlap with CPSU members for those it intends to cover is about 100%). But I have kept one and will re-add the other, since I don't want to get tangled in that debate. You were also right on principle about Romanian politicians (which I simply hadn't noticed), but note that he is already in there through the PSDR members category (I since added another more specific and newish category for his case).

This is not a trivial point, a major value of awards articles is to read sources from a particular year.\n\nThe article has [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:WhatLinksHere\/List_of_Golden_Plate_awardees no back links] to the winners. Every winner should have a mention in their article that they won the award, along with a wikilink back to this article (and a source! see above).  \n\nThe procedure when creating awards articles:\n#List who won the award that year.\n#Add a source for that year's award.\n#Create a back-link in the winners article, copying the same source from above. \n\nAnything less is incomplete!

Is sugar\/corn syrup a type of sweetener or not?  Is it appropriate to say that corn syrup is used to sweeten foods, as the other article does?  Is the definition given here appropriate?  Also, I think this definition is vague in some other ways - fewer calories per what unit?  Per gram?  Per perceived sweetness?  And is the comparison based on sucrose, or fructose, or glucose, or some other sugar?  I think that a better definition might cover anything which makes food taste sweeter, including sugar and things like pear juice, and that a list of sugar-based sweeteners should be added to the article.  But I am no expert!\n\nWhat about people on low-carbohydrate diets who use sugar substitutes not to reduce calorie intake, but instead carb intake?\n\nCould this article simply be renamed \"sugar substitute?\"  --[[User:Mcnett|Mcnett]] 23:53, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)\n\n----\n\n----\n:I am making the change -- \"sweetener\" means \"something that adds sweetness\", and I don't think anyone could argue that sugar does not add sweetness. In the Oxford dictionary (but not in Webster's), \"sweetener\" is defined as being \"something that sweetens, especially something other than sugar\". So it seems this is a Britishism. Even if it is, the current article does not make note of this, so I am moving the \"sweetener\" article to \"sugar substitute\" and writing a short stub for \"sweetener\" which makes mention of the Britishism.\n:::[[User:Tooki|Tooki]] 18:59, 10 Jul 2004 (UTC)\n\n:: But the OED strives to be a dictionary of all English dialects, and if a usage is peculiar to some dialect, makes a note of this.

I guess something should be done about this, obviously many people use \"Sweeteners\" for things other than \"Artificial sweeteners\" (and I must add, if there IS a phrase \"Artificial sweeteners\", that should mean there ARE sweeteners which are NOT artificial).

When they bloom, they are usually pale pink or pink in color. Full sun exposure is needed in order for growth to take place. Le Conte's Thistle has a National Wetland Indicator Status of FACW-usually occurs in wetlands. <ref>[http:\/\/davesgarden.com\/guides\/pf\/go\/97888\/ davesgarden-Le Contes thistle]<\/ref> The stems are loosely arachnoid and stiffly ascending. Leaves have blades that are linear to oblong or narrowly elliptic, lobes undivided or coarsely few toothed, loosely arachnoid when young, abaxial and adaxial faces glabrous; basal sometimes absent at flowering, petiolate. Heads born singly or less common in open corymbiform arrays. Penduncles are 5-30 cm elevated above cauline leaves. Cypselae is light brown in color, 5-5.75mm.[boof ref] Plants are often unbranched or sparingly branched, with single terminal flower heads that are above the foliage(plant leaves). Stem and lower leaf surfaces have cob webby hairs. With age, the plant starts loosing the hairs and becoming glabrous(hairless,smooth). Mid-stem leaves are approximately 15 cm long, pinnately lobed, and the leaves gradually reduced in size up the stem. Corollas are pinkish-purple with feather-like pappus bristles (modified sepals).<ref>[http:\/\/docs.google.com\/a\/students.ncc.edu\/viewer?a=v&q=cache:u9nGak-tF6oJ:www.wlf.louisiana.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/pdf\/fact_sheet_plant\/31794-Cirsium%2520lecontei\/cirsium_lecontei.pdf+cirsum+lecontei&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEEShXRaygFQKffzYFiExt9VmpmoeE4xV5W-FEqaV5hr06Oco8hxQCRsugO_Q00eFF74NBweFBU4xa1bvIvroV8BWVrYK4nTcbbI1X9W9gqgoaOUd57belPj9mieL5fmIjilvgw-Db&sig=AHIEtbQwPS-5xud5CSFnGIhmjfe7D9chxQ googledoc-cirsium lecontei]<\/ref>\n\n==Distribution==\n''Cirsium lecontei'' or Le Conte's thistle's floral region is native in North America. They occur on the sandy pinelands of southern coastal plain in damp soil(where co-occurring species include Myrica, Cyrilla, and Ilex)[BOOF REF], specifically in the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina and South Carolina. They are also found in grassy (often moist to wet) pine savannahs and pine barrens, bogs (where co-occurring species include pitcher plants, Ilex, sedges, grasses, and sphagnum), and roadside ditches.<ref>[http:\/\/www.natureserve.org\/explorer\/servlet\/NatureServe?sourceTemplate=tabular_report.wmt&loadTemplate=species_RptComprehensive.wmt&selectedReport=RptComprehensive.wmt&summaryView=tabular_report.wmt&elKey=158669&paging=home&save=true&startIndex=1&nextStartIndex=1&reset=false&offPageSelectedElKey=158669&offPageSelectedElType=species&offPageYesNo=true&post_processes=&radiobutton=radiobutton&selectedIndexes=158669 naturereserve-LeContes thistle]<\/ref>\n\n\n\n==Threats==\n''Cirsium lecontei'' occurs mostly in North Carolina but even there it appears to be rare.

He captured his first PBA title in his 108th career event, winning the PBA Exempt Doubles Classic with partner [[Danny Wiseman]] in the 2007{{ndash}}08 season. He earned his first singles title at the 2010 One-a-Day [[Dick Weber]] Open, defeating all-time titles leader [[Walter Ray Williams, Jr.]] in the final match.\n\nHis next victory came at the 2012 Brunswick Euro Challenge, a World Bowling Tour event, where he was credited with his third PBA Title. Having lost to [[Chris Barnes (bowler)|Chris Barnes]] in his first TV appearance at the semifinals of the 2003 Empire State Open in [[Latham, New York]], Fagan got his revenge on Barnes in the 2012 [[USBC Masters]], overcoming a 30-pin deficit after five frames to win his fourth title and first major championship.<ref>Vint, Bill. \"Mike Fagan Tops Chris Barnes to Win First Major Title in Alka Seltzer Plus Liquid Gels USBC Masters.\" Article at www.pba.com on January 29, 2012.

Seems unlikely to me, and the names will have to be deleted. I do think the positions should be in there, however. [[User:DPr77|DPr77]] 14:03, 25 December 2006 (UTC)\n\n:I agree, only the positions. There is no reason for names to be here since they do not add any encyclopedic value to the article. [[User:Brian Crawford|BC]] 00:22, 23 January 2007 (UTC)\n\n:Further to the above, the article seems to be turning into a giant list of people. This is not what WP is for. I think all we need are the positions, the rank structure, and how the Guard is organized. Lists of people's names who hold such and such rank or who were involved with a race or who used to work with the Guard are not important or notable in the least for the purposes of WP, and are certainly not encyclopedic. I propose that all names be deleted and that a chart similar to the ones that exist now be used to present rank in proper order with the insignia to illustrate the ranks. Ranks should also be explained properly. For instance, what is an artillery rank vs. an Infantry rank? [[User:Brian Crawford|BC]] 08:04, 14 February 2007 (UTC)\n\n: I utterly agree, and would also point out that the summer employees (many of them teenagers) were not consulted before their full names were put up on the web in this manner. There is no possible reason for those names to be part of this entry: they can include that information on the official Fort site if they wish, assuming they get permission from the employees. I have removed the staff names. It still needs a lot of clean-up. 21:45, 22 May 2007.\n\n::Your change was reverted by an IP and I don't think that removing the names is going to stick. I think the only way to prevent staff being listed is to protect the page. The majority of changes are from IP addresses and I believe that there is a protection process that can be enabled to prevent changes by non-registered users. After protection is enabled, then the page can be changed to delete all names and leave only the relevant stuff. FHG members are using this page as a vanity display, which of course is not what Wikipedia is about.[[User:Brian Crawford|BC]] 23:06, 23 May 2007 (UTC)\n\n:Agreed. The lists are self-promotional and totally unnecessary. Having the officers is almost justifiable, but to have every single staff member is ridiculous. How can protection be enabled?

[[User:Brian Crawford|BC]] 12:58, 23 July 2007 (UTC)\n\n== Neutral Language, Please == \nAs a past Guard member, I share and understand the palpable pride with which the numerous authors have described the institution. However, it is worth pointing out that in an encyclopedia, over-enthusiastic praise - if genuine - lends an air of disreputability. The article must have a neutral, dispassionate tone: let the Guard's professionalism and esprit de corps speak for itself.  Overweening praise is counter-productive.\n\nI have, accordingly, removed a couple of the most flagrantly positive adjectives from the main text. (\"Countless\" events; the Queen's \"sincere\" appreciation; and some others). However, I point out that the remaining text is still a little too enthusiastic to be neutral - the last paragraph, referring to the \"steeped\"ness of the tradition, is of particularly questionable relevance to the Wikipedia format. However, to avoid major furore, I have left that up. \n[[User:Dmhaglund|Dmhaglund]] ([[User talk:Dmhaglund|talk]]) 13:46, 18 February 2008 (UTC)\n\n== Fort Henry Guard Motto ==\n\nWhoever created this mistakenly put an incorrect Motto \"Honi Soit Qui Mal y Pense\" is not the Guard Motto.  \"Merentur Etiam\" (We also serve) is the Guard Motto.\nFHG1863  <small>\u2014Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions\/199.246.2.9|199.246.2.9]] ([[User talk:199.246.2.9|talk]]) 14:57, 20 November 2007 (UTC)<\/small><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\n\nTechnically the Motto is from one of the plaques on the wall at Fort Henry showing all of the regiments that served at the Fort.  The full Motto is Merentur Etiam Se Parati - as per the plaque - rough Transelation \"We also serve who are prepared\" or \"We also serve who stand and wait\".   This referrs to the fact that the Fort was never in a military engagement, so the soldiers garrisoned there never saw any military action at the Fort.  During the Sunset Ceremonies commentary the \"We also serve\" part is mentioned only.

Whilst this is true, there are many strong traditions and connections with ex-Guard and the Fort to the Canadian Forces.\n\nFort Proper \n- sits upon land leased from the Department of National Defence\n- was a POW Camp for German Prisoners during WWII - garrisoned by members of the Princess of Wales Own Regiment (this happened after the guard was formed in 1938).\n\nGuard Ceremonial Connections with the Canadian Forces\n- strong relationship with the Governor General Foot Guards, the Princess of Wales Own Regiment, the Royal Military College, Queen's Own Rifles, and HMCS Ontario\n- all of these units have paraded and in some cases done exchanges with the Fort Henry Guard.\n- e.g Skirmishing Tactics were taught to the Guard in 1993 by members of the Queen's Own Rifles.\n- Members of the Fort Henry Guard Club of Canada are invited to attend the Remembrance Day Ceremonies with members of the Queen's Own Rifles in Toronto.\n\nFormer Guardsmen who were also in the Canadian Forces.\n- there is a commemorative plaque on the Fort Grounds that lists members from the Guard who were killed during WWII.  Some of these former guardsmen were also graduates from RMC.\n- in the prior to the 1990's, the guard was overseen by a Guard Commander - in many cases this person was a Retired Sgt Major from the Canadian Forces.  (e.g. Jim Elliot)\n- whilst I was in the guard (1993-1996) there were numerous guardsmen who had connections with the Canadian Forces (ex-cadets from Air, Navy, and Army, ex-reservists e.g. PWOR and GGFGs, and ex Reg Force Members - e.g. Vimy Band) \n- Guardsmen who had been awarded medals and decorations were encouraged to wear these itmes for cerimonial parades (e.g. Guard \/ Marines Parade).\n\nRegards, FHG 1655.\n\nBased on all of these things, I think it is incorrect to ignore the informal, traditional, and ceremonial connections that the Guard has with the Canadian Forces.  <span style=\"font-size: smaller;\" class=\"autosigned\">\u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions\/131.107.0.81|131.107.0.81]] ([[User talk:131.107.0.81|talk]]) 18:01, 28 March 2012 (UTC)<\/span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\n:No one is ignoring this; all statements\/claims should be adequately [[wp:verifiability|sourced]].[[User:Brian Crawford|<span style=\"color:white;background:#73C2FB;\">&nbsp;<b>'''''BC'''''<\/b>&nbsp;<\/span>]] <sub>[[User talk:Brian Crawford|'''<font color=\"DarkGray\">talk to me<\/font>''']]<\/sub> 18:47, 10 January 2015 (UTC)","timestamp":"20160410104350","user-timestamp":"20150410104350"},{"title":"User talk:Oakleyplainsmen","content":"[[File:Nuvola apps important yellow.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] '''Welcome to Wikipedia.'''

He became one of the main icons of the Argentine rock and has sold over 1.3 million copies.\n\n==Life and career==\n===Abuelos de la Nada===\nAndres Calamaro was born in [[Buenos Aires]]. At 17 years of age he participated as a guest in the recording of an album of the group ''Ra\u00edces'', and shortly after he started his own band, the ''Elmer Band'', with guitarist friend Gringui Herrera. This band had an underground hit, ''Tristeza de la Ciudad'' (City Blues).<ref name=\"bio\">[http:\/\/www.calamaro.com\/bio\/bio.asp Official biography] (Spanish)<\/ref>\n\nWhen [[Miguel Abuelo]], leader of ''[[Los Abuelos de la Nada]]'', returned to Argentina, he reunited the band and invited Calamaro to play keyboards. The band was a big success; Calamaro wrote some of their greatest hits, such as ''Sin gamul\u00e1n'', ''Mil horas'' and ''Costumbres argentinas''.\n\n===Break-up===\nBefore the dissolution of ''Los Abuelos de la Nada'', Calamaro released his first solo album, ''Hotel Calamaro'' in 1984. A second album, ''Vida Cruel'', recorded shortly after his separation from the band, was received warmly by the press but did not achieve commercial success.\n\nAfter a third album, ''Por Mirarte'' (1988), Calamaro started producing for bands such as [[Los Fabulosos Cadillacs]], [[Los Enanitos Verdes]] and soloists such as [[Fabiana Cantilo]].\n\nCalamaro closed the 1980s with his own band, featuring old friends Gringui Herrera and Ariel Rot, who recently came back from [[Spain]]. The trio recorded the album ''Nadie sale vivo de aqu\u00ed'' (No One Here Gets Out Alive) in 1989 with a number of guest musicians, which obtained the nomination of Best Record of the Year.\n\n===Los Rodr\u00edguez===\nDue to the economic situation in Argentina, Calamaro and Rot settled in Spain. Then, they  created the band ''[[Los Rodr\u00edguez]]'' with Juli\u00e1n Infante. Germ\u00e1n Villela joined at the drums. The band didn't have a bass player, but Guillermo Martin, Candi Avello and later Daniel Zamora accompanied the band in recordings and tours.\n\nLos Rodr\u00edguez released three successful studio albums: ''Buena Suerte'' (1991), ''Sin documentos'' (1993) and ''Palabras m\u00e1s, palabras menos'' (1995), as well as the live ''Disco Pirata'' (1992), and the compilation ''Hasta luego'' (1996).\n\n''Sin documentos'' gave them international acclaim, with its mixture of [[flamenco]] and [[Latin America]]n rhythms. They toured Spain and Latin America, and entered the history of [[Rock en Espa\u00f1ol|Rock in Spanish]].\n\n===Solo===\nAndr\u00e9s Calamaro released ''Grabaciones Encontradas'' (\"Found recordings\" which in Spanish could also be understood as \"Conflicting Recordings\") while working with Los Rodr\u00edguez. After ''Palabras m\u00e1s, palabras menos'', the band released a \"Greatest Hits\" album, which sold nicely, and then dissolved.\n\nIn 1996, Calamaro performed \"Cosas Que Me Ayudan A Olvidar (Things That Help Me To Forget)\" for the [[AIDS]] benefit album ''[[Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]. In 1997 Calamaro recorded ''Alta suciedad'' (literally \"High Filth,\" but also a pun \"High Society\"\/\"Alta Sociedad\"), which sold over half a million copies and took him again touring around Latin America. \n\nCalamaro began composing song after song. In six months, he had over 100 songs ready to be released. Thirty seven of these found their way to his next album, ''Honestidad brutal''. The album included hits such as: ''Te quiero igual'', ''Paloma'', ''Los aviones'', ''Cuando te conoc\u00ed'' and ''La parte de adelante''. This double CD was created after the breakup with his girlfriend, which reflected in the songs. The album also contains a collaboration with [[Diego Maradona]].\n\nIn 2000, he recorded 103 songs in his five-CD album ''El Salm\u00f3n''.\n\n===Free music===\nIn the following years, Calamaro made many guest appearances in concerts and recordings. He posted unpublished songs from 2001-2002 for free download over the Internet, saying that ''\"Music belongs to those who want to hear it; and to nobody else\"''.\n\nHe also made his home recordings available at [http:\/\/www.deepcamboya.com.ar\/ DeepCamboya]. Due to the low quality of the recordings, and with permission of the author, [http:\/\/www.camisetasparatodos.com\/ Camisetas Para Todos], a group of fans, re-mastered Calamaro's songs and made them available on their site. He also started ''Radio Salm\u00f3n Vaticano'', a virtual recording studio at his [http:\/\/www.calamaro.com\/ web site].\n\nIn 2004 he released ''El Cantante'' (The Singer), an album with covers of [[tango music|Tango]]s and other Latin American rhythms, and a few of his web released songs.\n\n===The Return===\nIn 2005 he released ''El Regreso'' (The Return), a compilation of the live recordings from his appearance in the [[Luna Park, Buenos Aires|Luna Park]] Stadium earlier that year. The disc was presented on December 17 to an audience of 20,000 in the Obras Sanitarias Stadium, and was awarded with the 2006 Gardel Award for ''Rock album by Male Artist'' and ''Best Album Cover''.

It lies to the southeast of the crater [[Moiseev (crater)|Moiseev]], and northeast of [[Saenger (crater)|Saenger]].\n\nThe western inner wall of Al-Khwarizmi is much wider than along the eastern side. The eastern rim overlays a pair of craters, including Al-Khwarizmi J. The outer wall is somewhat distorted from a circular shape, including a double-rim in the south. There is a small central peak at the midpoint, which forms part of a low ridge that bends to the northeast. Several tiny craterlets lie in the northern part of the interior floor. The floor to the southeast is somewhat smoother and free of significant impacts.\n\nThe crater was named for the [[Persian people|Persian]] mathematician and astronomer [[Mu\u1e25ammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b|Al-Khwarizmi]].\n\n==Satellite craters==\nBy convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Al-Khwarizmi.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Al-Khwarizmi \n!width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Latitude\n!width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Longitude\n!width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Diameter\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|B\n|align=\"center\"|9.0\u00b0 N\n|align=\"center\"|107.4\u00b0 E\n|align=\"center\"|62&nbsp;km\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|G\n|align=\"center\"|6.9\u00b0 N\n|align=\"center\"|107.1\u00b0 E\n|align=\"center\"|95&nbsp;km\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|H\n|align=\"center\"|6.0\u00b0 N\n|align=\"center\"|109.2\u00b0 E\n|align=\"center\"|50&nbsp;km\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|J\n|align=\"center\"|6.2\u00b0 N\n|align=\"center\"|107.6\u00b0 E\n|align=\"center\"|47&nbsp;km\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|K\n|align=\"center\"|4.6\u00b0 N\n|align=\"center\"|107.6\u00b0 E\n|align=\"center\"|26&nbsp;km\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|L\n|align=\"center\"|3.9\u00b0 N\n|align=\"center\"|107.4\u00b0 E\n|align=\"center\"|35&nbsp;km\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|M\n|align=\"center\"|3.1\u00b0 N\n|align=\"center\"|107.0\u00b0 E\n|align=\"center\"|18&nbsp;km\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|T\n|align=\"center\"|7.0\u00b0 N\n|align=\"center\"|104.5\u00b0 E\n|align=\"center\"|15&nbsp;km\n|}\n<gallery>\nImage:Al-Khwarizmi K crater AS11-42-6282.jpg|Al-Khwarizmi K crater from [[Apollo 11]]\nFile:Al-Khwarizmi K crater AS16-P-4298.jpg|Another view of Al-Khwarizmi K from [[Apollo 16]]\nFile:Al-Khwarizmi M crater AS16-P-4295.jpg|A view of Al-Khwarizmi M from [[Apollo 16]]\n<\/gallery>\n\n==References==\n* [[Farouk El-Baz|El-Baz, Farouk]]. \"Al-Khwarizmi: A New-Found Basin on the Lunar Far Side\".

Metropolitan Region]] (''Metropolregion Hamburg''), the fifth largest city  (with approximately 75,000 inhabitants) in the  [[States of Germany|federal state]] of [[Schleswig-Holstein]], belonging to the district (''Kreis'') [[Segeberg]].\n\n== History ==\nNorderstedt was created by the merger of four towns on 1 January 1970: the towns of '''Friedrichsgabe''' and '''Garstedt''', both belonging to the [[Pinneberg (district)|district Pinneberg]], and the towns of '''Glash\u00fctte''' and '''Harksheide''', both belonging to the [[Stormarn (district)|district Stormarn]]. The newly created city was assigned to the [[Segeberg|district Segeberg]].\n\n== Location ==\nThe city hall of Norderstedt is located at {{coord|53|42|29|N|9|59|37|E|}}. Norderstedt is the southernmost city of [[Segeberg|district Segeberg]], bordering in the southeast on [[Hamburg]] and part of Hamburg agglomeration.\n\n== Transportation and Logistics ==\nNorderstedt is served by the [[Autobahn]] (federal motorway)  A7\/E45 via exit number 21 Hamburg-Schnelsen-Nord (Norderstedt-S\u00fcd), located on [[Hamburg]] territory, in the south, and exit number 23 Quickborn in the north. Major thoroughfares are the ''Bundesstrasse''n (federal highways) B432 in west-east and B433 in north-south directions.\n\nThe closest airport is that of [[Hamburg]] ([[IATA airport code]] HAM),  whose runway 33 extends across the state border into Norderstedt.\n\nNorderstedt does not have a [[Deutsche Bahn]] railway station. A north-south railway service with small commuter trains runs between Ulzburg S\u00fcd in the north and [[Norderstedt Mitte (Hamburg U-Bahn station)|Norderstedt Mitte]] in the south. Norderstedt Mitte is also the terminus of the [[Hamburg U-Bahn|Hamburg underground]] line U1. Travel time from [[Hamburg Hauptbahnhof|Hamburg Central Station]] (''Hauptbahnhof'') to Norderstedt Mitte is 40 minutes. The other two stations of the [[Hamburg U-Bahn#Network routes overview|U1 line]] are [[Richtweg (Hamburg U-Bahn station)|Richtweg]] and Garstedt.<ref>[http:\/\/www.hvv.de\/pdf\/fahrplaene\/usar\/hvv_usar_regio.pdf Network plan Hamburg public transport association (HVV)] (pdf) 560&nbsp;KiB <!--application\/pdf,573.198bytes --><\/ref>\n\nNorderstedt is covered by the [[List of postal codes in Germany|postal codes]] 22844, 22846, 22848, 22850 and 22851.

It is held annually just north of the [[Ottawa River]] between the regions of [[Montreal]] and [[Ottawa]], capital of [[Canada]], in February and usually covers a distance of {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on}}.  However, it is a ski tour, not a race: participants challenge not each other, but themselves by choosing a level of difficulty and trying to accomplish that goal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/csm-mcs.com\/en\/the-event\/what-is-csm\/|title=The Canadian Ski Marathon: A Celebration of Canada's Winter|publisher=Canadian Ski Marathon|accessdate=5 March 2015}}<\/ref>\n\n==Ski marathon==\nThe Marathon, which has been running since [[Canadian Centennial|Canada's Centennial year of 1967]], is the longest in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/usatoday30.usatoday.com\/travel\/destinations\/ski\/2011-01-22-canadian-ski-marathon_N.htm|title=Canada hosts world's longest cross-country ski marathon|publisher=USA Today|author=Pat Horne|date=22 January 2011|accessdate=5 March 2015}}<\/ref> It consists of 10 sections of varying lengths and difficulties which can either be skied together over the two days (five stages per day), or individually on subsequent days. Depending on the year, the direction of the race can vary. Typically, in even-numbered years participants ski eastward toward [[Lachute]] from the start in [[Buckingham, Quebec|Buckingham]] (now a district of Gatineau); odd numbered years see participants travel in the opposite direction. In both cases, the end of the first day of the Marathon has participants ending in (or near as is the case of certain skier classes) the scenic town of [[Montebello, Quebec]], where they will resume their proper course the following day.\n\nThe two-day event is open to anyone of any age or ability, but the course is extremely challenging in places, which skiers of lesser ability tend to avoid by choosing easier sections to tackle. Of note is the section west of the Lac Carling resort, which is known throughout the Marathon as the most difficult section.\n\nThere are two broad categories of skier: ''Coureur des Bois'' (who start out before dawn to ski the entire distance; named after the [[coureur des bois]]) and Tourer (who start out at 8 a.m. to ski any number of the 10 sections). The Coureur des Bois category, in turn, is broken down into Bronze (ski the whole trail), Silver (ski the whole trail with a pack), and Gold (ski the whole trail with a pack and camp out overnight). Tourers are able to ski as individuals, or as teams. A new feature of the marathon is the \"mini-CSM\" which allows participants to ski two sections of the trail over the weekend, one per day.\n\nTraditionally, the hardest goal is the Gold ''Coureur des Bois'' category. Also, one may register for skiing at the Gold level only after completing the Silver and Bronze levels in previous years. Doing the Gold five times\u2014over any number of years\u2014results in that person earning a permanent bib, meaning that they are given a number that is then retired from the list of bib numbers. As of 2012, 300 Coureur des Bois skiers\u2014primarily men, and a much smaller number of women\u2014have earned permanent bibs by earning 5 Golds: 1 Gold Award and 4 Gold Bars.\n\nThe marathon has hundreds of volunteers who brave the cold to help skiers the entire weekend at checkpoints, providing safety + sweeps, waxing services, trail work, awards, and administration. These volunteers include members of local service organizations such as Scouting and Guiding, community groups, and cadets. Major logistical support is provided by [[33 Signal Regiment (Canada)|33 Signals Regiment]] of the Canadian forces, who provide vital safety and water points along the trail, and if needed provide traffic control.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Skiing|Skiing and skiing topics]]\n*[[Tour de Ski]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http:\/\/www.csm-mcs.com Canadian Ski Marathon]\n*[http:\/\/canadianmarathonstories.com\/Stories\/Parham_Momtahan.htm Canadian Ski Marathon: A Gold Coureur des Bois' story]\n*[http:\/\/momtahan.com\/csm2008\/ 2008 Canadian Ski Marathon: a brief history with photos]\n\n[[Category:Sport in Ottawa]]\n[[Category:Cross-country skiing competitions in Canada]]\n[[Category:Ski marathons]]\n[[Category:1967 establishments in Ontario]]\n[[Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1967]]\n[[Category:February sporting events]]","timestamp":"20160410104403","user-timestamp":"20150410104403"},{"title":"User talk:West Virginian","content":"{{User:Caponer\/header|My user talk page|Crystal Clear app messenger.png}}\n{{talkheader}}\n{{User:MiszaBot\/config\n|maxarchivesize = \n|counter = \n|minthreadsleft = \n|minthreadstoarchive = 50\n|algo = \n|archive = User talk:West Virginian\/Archive %(counter)d\n|search=yes\n}}\n\n==Merry Christmas!==\n{| align=center style=\"{{Round corners}}; font-family:Trebuchet MS, sans-serif; border: 3px solid Green; padding: 6px; background: white;\"\n|[[File:Gerard van Honthorst 001.jpg|100px|left]]\n|<font color=\"Red\">{{BASEPAGENAME}}, I hope you have a Merry Christmas and hope your day is full of the true spirit of the day.<br>Plus, good food, good family and good times. :)  Have a Great Day! :) - <small style=\"white-space:nowrap;border:1px solid #900;padding:1px;\">[[User:Neutralhomer|<span style=\"color:#900;\">Neutralhomer<\/span>]] \u2022 [[User talk:Neutralhomer|<span style=\"color:Black;\">Talk<\/span>]] \u2022 01:00, 25 December 2015 (UTC)<\/small> <\/font><br \/> \n\n<font color=\"Black\"><small>Spread the joy of Christmas by adding <nowiki>{{subst:User:Neutralhomer\/MerryChristmas}}<\/nowiki> to their talk page with a friendly message.<\/small><\/font>\n|}\n:{{u|Neutralhomer}}, Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you, too!

Two questions: was this one of the first library-building, literary, debating, or scientific societies in the country? (I see the sources aren't online.)

According to the offline sources cited, the society was the first organization of its kind in the present-day state of West Virginia, and one of the first in the United States, which I would assume would mean it was first library\/literary society\/debating society\/scientific society. All the sources say specifically \"of its kind.\" The society donated its Romney Classical Institute campus to the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind. The state accepted the donation, and the school opened at the society's former campus in September 1870.

Concurrently other DPP-4 inhibitors without a [[nitrile]] group were published but they contained other serine-interacting motifs, e.g. [[boronic acids]], [[phosphonate]]s or diacyl [[hydroxylamine]]s. These [[Chemical compound|compound]]s were not as potent because of the similarity of [[dipeptidyl peptidase-4|DPP-4]] and [[prolyl oligopeptidase]] (PEP) and also suffered from chemical [[instability]]. [[Ferring Pharmaceuticals]] filed for patent on two cyanopyrrolidine DPP-4 inhibitors, which they published in 1995. These compounds had excellent [[potency (pharmacology)|potency]] and improved chemical stability.\n\nIn 1995, Edwin B. Villhauer at [[Novartis]] started to explore N-substituted glycinyl-cyanopyrrolidines based on the fact that DPP-4 identifies N-methylglycine as a N-terminal [[amino acid]]. This group of new cyanopyrrolidines became extremely popular field of research in the following years. Some trials with dual inhibitors of DPP-4 and vasopeptidase have been represented, since vasopeptidase inhibition is believed to enhance the antidiabetic effect of [[dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors|DPP-4 inhibition]] by stimulating [[insulin]] secretion.

These [[hormone]]s regulate insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. (GLP-1 has many roles in the [[human body]].

When the function against [[type 2 diabetes]] was discovered, the cyanopyrrolidines became a highly popular research material.  A little later [[vildagliptin]] and [[saxagliptin]], which are the most developed cyanopyrrolidine [[DPP-4 inhibitor]]s to date, were discovered.<ref name=\"Peters_2007\" \/>\n\n====Cyanopyrrolidines====\n\nCyanopyrrolidines have two key interactions to the DPP-4 complex:<ref name=\"Peters_2007\" \/>\n\n1. [[Nitrile]] in the position of the [[scissile bond]] of the peptidic substrate that is important for high potency.  The nitrile group forms reversible [[covalent bonds]] with the catalytically active [[serine]] hydroxyl (Ser630), i.e. cyanopyrrolidines are competitive inhibitors with slow dissociation kinetics.\n\n2. [[Hydrogen bond]]ing network between the protonated amino group and a negatively [[electric charge|charged]] region of the [[protein]] surface, Glu205, Glu206 and Tyr662.  All cyanopyrrolidines have basic, primary or secondary [[amine]], which makes this network possible but these compounds usually drop in potency if these amines are changed. Nonetheless, two patent applications unveil that the amino group can be changed, i.e. replaced by a [[hydrazine]], but it is claimed that these compounds do not only act ''via'' DPP-4 inhibition but also prevent diabetic vascular complications by acting as a [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]] scavenger.\n\n=====Structure-activity relationship (SAR)=====\n\nImportant [[structure-activity relationship]]:<ref name=Simpkins_2007>{{Citation |doi=10.1016\/j.bmcl.2007.09.090 |last1=Simpkins |first1=Ligaya |last2=Bolton |first2=Scott |last3=Pi |first3=Zulan |last4=Scutton |first4=James |last5=Kwon |first5=Chet |last6=Magnin |first6=David |last7=Augeri |first7=David |last8=Gungor |first8=Timur |last9=Rotella |first9=David |last10=Hamann |first10=Lawrence |title=Potent non-nitrile dipeptidic dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors |journal=Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters |volume=17 |issue=23 |pages=6476\u20136480 |date=September 2007  |url=http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6TF9-4PT1SC6-1&_user=713789&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=713789&md5=417ae5d6a31a5ab0d6dd3e9d639f55e2 |pmid=17937986 |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 July 2013}}<\/ref>\n\n1. Strict steric constraint exists around the [[pyrrolidine]] ring of cyanopyrrolidine-based inhibitors, with only [[hydrogen]], [[fluoro]], [[acetylene]], [[nitrile]], or methano substitution permitted.\n\n2. Presence of a [[nitrile]] moiety on the [[pyrrolidine]] ring is critical to achieving potent activity\n\nAlso, systematic SAR investigation has shown that the ring size and [[stereochemistry]] for the P2 position is quite conditioned.   A 5-membered ring and L-configuration has shown better results than a 4-membered or 6-membered ring with D-configuration. Only minor changes on the [[pyrrolidine]] ring can be tolerated, since the good fit of the ring with the [[hydrophobic]] S1 pocket is very important for high affinity.  Some trials have been made, e.g. by replacing the [[pyrrolidine]] with a [[thiazolidine|thiazoline]]. That led to improved potency but also loss of chemical stability.  Efforts to improve chemical stability often led to loss of specificity because of interactions with [[DPP8|DPP-8]] and [[DPP9|DPP-9]]. These [[chemical interaction|interaction]]s have been connected with increased [[toxicity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] in animals.  There are strict limitations in the P1 position and hardly any changes are tolerated. On the other hand, a variety of changes can be made in the P2 position. In fact, [[substitution reaction|substitution]] with quite big branched side chains, e.g. ''tert''-butylglycin, normally increased activity and chemical stability, which could lead to longer-lasting inhibition of the DPP-4 enzyme.  It has also been noted that [[biaryl]]-based [[side chains]] can also give highly active inhibitors.  It was originally believed that only [[lipophilic]] substitution would be tolerated.  Now it is stated that also the substitution of [[Chemical polarity|polar]] negatively charged side-chains as well as [[hydrophilic]] substitution can lead to excellent inhibitory activity.<ref name=\"Peters_2007\" \/>\n\n=====Chemical stability=====\n\n[[File:Intramolecular cyclization of cis-rotamer.svg|thumb|330px|left|'''Fig.5:''' ''Trans''-rotamers are more stable then ''cis''-rotamers. ''Cis''-rotamers undergo intramolecular cyclization.]]\n\nIn general, [[DPP-4 inhibitor]]s are not very stable compounds. Therefore, many researchers focus on enhancing the stability for cyanopyrrolidines. The most widespread technique to improve chemical stability is to incorporate a [[steric bulk]]. The two cyanopyrrolidines that have been most pronounced, [[vildagliptin]] and [[saxagliptin]], were created in this manner. K579 is a [[DPP-4 inhibitor]] discovered by researchers at Kyowa Hakko Kyogo. It had improved not only chemical stability but also a longer-lasting action. That long-lasting action was most likely due to slow dissociation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex and an active [[oxide]] [[metabolite]] that undergoes enterohepatic circulation. The discovery of the active [[oxide]] was in fact a big breakthrough as it led to the development of [[vildagliptin]] and [[saxagliptin]]. One major problem in [[DPP-4 inhibitor]] stability is [[intramolecular]] cyclization. The precondition for the [[intramolecular]] cyclization is the conversion of the ''trans''-[[rotamer]], which is the DPP-4 binding [[rotamer]] (''Figure 5''). Thus, preventing this conversion will increase stability. This prevention was successful when incorporating an amide group into a ring, creating a compound that kept the DPP-4 inhibitory activity that, did not undergo the [[intramolecular]] cyclization and was even more selective over different DPP enzymes. It has also been reported that a cyanoazetidine in the P1 position and a \u03b2-amino acid in the P2 position increased stability.<ref name=\"Peters_2007\" \/>\n\n=====Vildagliptin=====\n\n[[Vildagliptin]] (Galvus)(''Figure 6'') was first synthesized in May 1998 and was named after Edwin B. Villhauer.  It was discovered when researchers at [[Novartis]] examined adamantyl [[derivative]]s that had proven to be very [[potency (pharmacology)|potent]].  The [[adamantyl]] group worked as a [[steric bulk]] and slowed [[intramolecular]] cyclization while increasing chemical stability.  Furthermore, the primary [[metabolite]]s were highly active. To avoid additional [[Chiral (chemistry)|chiral]] center a [[hydroxylation]] at the [[adamantyl]] ring was carried out (''Figure 6''). The product, [[vildagliptin]], was even more stable, undergoing [[intramolecular]] cyclization 30-times slower, and having high [[DPP-4 inhibitor]]y activity and longer-lasting [[pharmacodynamic]] effect.<ref name=\"Peters_2007\" \/>\n\n=====Saxagliptin=====\n\n[[File:Structure of cyanopyrrolidine DPP-4 inhibitors.svg|thumb|450px|'''Fig.6:''' The basic structure of cyanopyrrolidines compared with vildagliptin, saxagliptin, and denagliptin]]\nResearchers at [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] found that increased [[steric bulk]] of the ''N''-terminal [[amino acid]] [[Side chain|side-chain]] led to increased stability. To additionally increase stability the ''trans''-[[rotamer]] was stabilized with a ''cis''-4,5-methano substitution of the [[pyrrolidine]] ring, resulting in an [[intramolecular]] [[van der Waals force|van-der-Waals]] interaction, thus preventing [[intramolecular]] cyclisation. Because of that increased stability, the researchers continued their investigation on ''cis''-4,5-methano cyanopyrrolidines and came across with a new [[adamantyl]] [[derivative]], which showed extraordinary ''ex vivo'' DPP-4 inhibition in rat plasma. Also noted, high [[microsomal]] turnover rate which indicated that the derivative was quickly converted to an active [[metabolite]]. After [[hydroxylation]] on the [[adamantyl]] group they had a product with better [[microsomal]] stability and improved chemical stability. That product was named [[saxagliptin]] (Onglyza) (''Figure 6'').<ref name=\"Peters_2007\" \/> In June 2008 [[AstraZeneca]] and [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] submitted a new drug application for Onglyza in the [[United States]] and a marketing authorization application in [[Europe]].<ref>{{Citation |url=http:\/\/www.astrazeneca-us.com\/search\/?itemId=3310018 |title=AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb submit New Drug Application in the United States and Marketing Authorization Application in Europe for ONGLYZA\u2122 (saxagliptin) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110707182217\/http:\/\/www.astrazeneca-us.com\/search\/?itemId=3310018 |archivedate=2011-07-07 |accessdate=29 July 2013}}<\/ref> Approval was granted in the [[United States]] by the FDA in July 2009 for Onglyza 5&nbsp;mg and Onglyza 2.5&nbsp;mg.

When they started internal screening and [[medicinal chemistry]] program, two [[DPP-4 inhibitor]]s were already in [[clinical trials]], isoleucyl thiazolidide (P32\/38) and NVP-DPP728 from [[Novartis]].  [[Merck & Co.|Merck]] in-licensed L-''threo''-isoleucyl [[thiazolidine|thiazolidide]] and its ''allo'' [[stereoisomer]].  In animal studies, they found that both [[isomers]] had similar affinity for DPP-4, similar ''in vivo'' efficacy, similar [[pharmacokinetic]] and metabolic profiles.  Nevertheless, the ''allo'' isomer was 10-fold more [[toxic]].  The researchers found out that this difference in [[toxicity]] was due to the ''allo'' isomer's greater inhibition of [[DPP8|DPP-8]] and [[DPP9|DPP-9]] but not because of selective DPP-4 inhibition.  More research also supported that DPP-4 inhibition would not cause compromised immune function.  Once this link between affinity for DPP-8\/DPP-9 and [[toxicity]] was discovered, [[Merck & Co.|Merck]] decided on identifying an inhibitor with more than a thousandfold affinity for DPP-4 over the other dipeptidases.  For this purpose, they used [[positional scanning libraries]].  From scanning these libraries, the researchers discovered that both DPP-4 and [[DPP8|DPP-8]] showed a strong preference for breaking down [[peptide]]s with a [[proline]] at the P1 position but they found a great difference at the P2 site; i.e., they found that acidic functionality at the P2 position could provide a greater affinity for DPP-4 over [[DPP8|DPP-8]].  [[Merck & Co.|Merck]] kept up doing even more research and screening.  They stopped working on compounds from the \u03b1-amino acid series related to isoleucyl [[thiazolidine|thiazolidide]] due to lack of selectivity but instead they discovered a very selective \u03b2-[[amino acid]] [[piperazine]] series through [[structure-activity relationship|SAR]] studies on two screening leads. When trying to stabilize the [[piperazine]] [[moiety (chemistry)|moiety]], a group of [[bicyclic]] derivatives were made, which led to the identification of a [[potency (pharmacology)|potent]] and selective triazolopiperazine series.  Most of these [[Structural analog|analogs]] showed excellent [[pharmacokinetic]] properties in [[preclinical]] species. Optimization of these compounds finally led to the discovery of [[sitagliptin]].<ref name=Thornberry_2007>{{Citation | doi = 10.2174\/156802607780091028 | last = Thornberry | first = Nancy A. | author-link = | last2 = Weber | first2 = Ann E. |title = Discovery of JANUVIA<sup>TM<\/sup> (Sitagliptin), a Selective Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV Inhibitor for the Treatment of Type2 Diabetes | journal = Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 7 | pages = 557\u2013568 | date = March 2007  |url=http:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/content\/ben\/ctmc\/2007\/00000007\/00000006\/art00003 | pmid = 17352677 | issue = 6 |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 July 2013}}<\/ref>\n\n====Sitagliptin====\n\n[[File:Sitagliptin.svg|thumb|250px|right|'''Fig.7:''' The structure of sitagliptin]]\n[[Sitagliptin]] (Januvia) has a novel structure with \u03b2-amino amide [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]] (''Figure 7'').

[[Quinazolinone]] based compounds interacted effectively with the DPP-4 complex, but suffered from low metabolic [[half-life]].  It was found that when replacing the [[quinazolinone]] with a pyrimidinedione, the metabolic stability was increased and the result was a [[Potency (pharmacology)|potent]], selective, [[bioavailable]] [[DPP-4 inhibitor]] named [[alogliptin]]. The quinazoline based compounds showed potent inhibition and excellent selectivity over related [[protease]], [[DPP8|DPP-8]]. However, short [[metabolic]] [[half-life]] due to [[oxidation]] of the A-ring [[phenyl]] group was problematic.  At first, the researchers tried to make a [[fluorinated]] derivative. The derivative showed improved metabolic stability and excellent inhibition of the DPP-4 enzyme.  However, it was also found to inhibit [[CYP 450]] 3A4 and block the [[hERG]] channel. The solution to this problem was to replace the [[quinazolinone]] with other [[heterocycle]]s, but the [[quinazolinone]] could be replaced without any loss of DPP-4 inhibition. [[Alogliptin]] was discovered when quinazolinone was replaced with a [[pyrimidinedione]]. [[Alogliptin]] has shown excellent inhibition of DPP-4 and extraordinary selectivity, greater than 10.000 fold over the closely related serine proteases [[DPP8|DPP-8]] and [[DPP9|DPP-9]].  Also, it does not inhibit the [[CYP 450]] enzymes nor block the [[hERG]] channel at concentration up to 30\u00b5M.

Located in the neighborhood of [[Long Island City]], in the borough of [[Queens]], the studio complex has been operating since 1983 in the former Silvercup Bakery building. It is owned and operated by brothers Alan and Stuart Suna.\n\n== History ==\nDuring its early years the facility was used mostly for the filming of music videos and commercials, although occasionally scenes for motion pictures were shot there, including ''[[Highlander (film)|Highlander]]'' and ''[[Garbo Talks]]''. Norman Leigh, well known among New York City filmmakers for his electrical\/gaffing work on the 1969 film ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'', oversaw the studio during its first few years.\n\nOver the years, use of the studio's space has shifted toward the production of television series.\n\n==Productions==\nSilvercup was the primary shooting facility for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Hope & Faith]]'', and HBO's ''[[Sex and the City]]'' and ''[[The Sopranos]]''.

Her work there was a crash course in art jewelry, and she eventually was hired by AJF for certain writings (usually donation requests and things of that nature). Most of the actual content AJF publishes is written by art historians, curators, professors, and makers. Art jewelry (or jewellery for the europeans) certainly is an incredibly small field that has clung to analog ways for far too long (probably due in part because EVERYTHING about our field is so physical). Personally, as someone who was trained both as a metalsmith and art historian, I am acutely aware of the problems that our field now faces. I am personally invested in helping digitize the field in order to help preserve it for the future. I started with AJF because I felt like they had one of the strongest cases; they are an incredibly respected and influential non profit in our field. The content they publish both online and in print only has a few competitors (friends?), mainly Metalsmith Magazine, American Crafts, and Current Obsession. As someone who teaches both metalsmithing studio classes and design history at a University level, I know how important these publications are to not only myself, but to my students education. AJF publications are widely used in academia. I am starting to become really frustrated that there is such a gap between what we as a field know, and what I can prove to Wikipedia.....

The deletion review hasn't been closed yet (it has to be closed by an administrator) so the note shouldn't be removed. The disputed neutrality notice is perhaps due to you being seen as connected with the CDDG- i.e. you will have a conflict of interest between serving the interests of the organisation and writing an article about them on Wikipedia. The article is then seen as promotion or advertising. Also bear in mind that the article should be explanatory- you've listed various projects, but the CDDG members are not the ones funding the projects, or physically working on them (as far as I know). '''But''' explanatory using reliable secondary sources (what someone not a member of the organisation and who is a reliable narrator has written about the CDDG). I've posted on Drmies' page asking for other editors to give their input so hopefully you'll have some further opinions on the matter. [[User:Xanthomelanoussprog|Xanthomelanoussprog]] ([[User talk:Xanthomelanoussprog#top|talk]]) 08:01, 16 September 2015 (UTC)\n\n== CDDG Page ==\n\nDear Xanthomelanoussprog,\n\nI read your comments with the other editor about our page and about our organization.  Yes, we are a small organization with 21 members and not 12 and I am the president who is actively involved in the wikipedia page.  I never mentioned in the table that we funded the projects but rather I am mentioning the funding sources.  I believe Dremeis is taking the issue personally since my last edits on Samir Geagea page and how I challenged a sentence that is not true there.  What more citations do anyone need for our projects. I am citing each and every project and using Google translate or any other translation program, one can easily see our involvement as technical assistance in the projects.  we are an NGO that supports technical assistance of projects given by major donors.  <small><span class=\"autosigned\">\u2014&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Wissamraji|Wissamraji]] ([[User talk:Wissamraji|talk]] \u2022 [[Special:Contributions\/Wissamraji|contribs]]) 12:50, 17 September 2015 (UTC)<\/span><\/small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\n\n*Dear Wissam Raji\n\nI apologise for the tone of my comments- the problem is not with your organisation but that all articles must be derived (in the main) from reliable secondary sources. Otherwise it would be easy for a commercial organisation or for an individual (such as a writer or artist) to use Wikipedia for their own promotion. For example [[Lebanese Forces]] had a section on its navy, which had a strong element of propaganda (I tried to rectify this). Drmies has to deal with a lot of these types of promotion, so he has a jaundiced view! I don't know about the Samir Geagea page- I have had a look at the source. It says \"Asiri also praised Geagea for holding a news conference in which he defended statements by the Saudi Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul Aziz bin Abdullah al-Sheikh, who said it was religiously legitimate to destroy churches in Kuwait because the Arab Peninsula should not see a \"meeting of two religions.\u201d\" There's two parts to this: Asiri wrote a letter in which he praised Geagea for defending statements by the Mufti. Secondly the Mufti said it was religiously legitimate to destroy churches. It doesn't follow that Geagea defended ''that'' statement- it would be better to go to a report of the news conference. I can't see that the ambassador would include that in his letter. p.s. don't forget to \"sign\" your messages with four tildes \"~\". It will automatically generate a signature.

[[User:Xanthomelanoussprog|Xanthomelanoussprog]] ([[User talk:Xanthomelanoussprog#top|talk]]) 17:37, 9 November 2015 (UTC)\n\n::Hi, it does look like a press release and I agree with your reservations about the research! I will keep looking for an article. I have found a resource which I think would be perfect but it's part of an online magazine so doesn't have a direct URL. Would this suffice?

In the end (and this is off the top of my head as it were!) it's just a matter of helping the reader to find the original source- thus \"it came from such-and-such magazine, issue XX, page YY. Try the various citation templates, which are in a drop-down menu at the top of the editing window- you have a sandbox which can be used for experimenting. I can't see a problem myself with using CVS press releases, as it's probably not an area where there's going to be a lot written about the subject by third parties.

That's why we instructed CVS to see if they could reduce our rates bills, to ensure our customers would not suffer with inflated pricing.\") It's also unclear- the article says that CVS was instructed by ProCook to reduce rates across their chain of 32 shops, but the assessor only studied one shop. CVS reduced the rates bill by \u00a330,000 per year; at a guess that's across the whole chain. ProCook's turnover is about \u00a312 million a year- so if they pass that saving on to their customers, they can drop their prices by 0.25%. Hmmm\u2026 Also curious is that ProCook's turnover equates to \u00a3375,000 per shop. A local charity bookshop near to me has a turnover in excess of \u00a3100,000- sell your shares in ProCook now {{smiley}} [[User:Xanthomelanoussprog|Xanthomelanoussprog]] ([[User talk:Xanthomelanoussprog#top|talk]]) 08:12, 11 November 2015 (UTC)\n\nHi, thanks for the feedback.

I've been going through the references, and the Bristol Post one was written by CVS_Surveyors (which presumably is CVS) and reads like an advert. According to the ''Telegraph'' article, ''This 'secret' and 'scandalous' business rates shake-up will cost small firms millions'', appeals made in April 2015 and after are only backdated to April 2015. Mark Rigby's quoted as saying that there were 206,000 properties whose rates had not been appealed, with the possibility of \u00a31.72 billion in refunds being lost due to the change. I don't know whether that deadline came into force- it must have affected CVS' business. [[User:Xanthomelanoussprog|Xanthomelanoussprog]] ([[User talk:Xanthomelanoussprog#top|talk]]) 16:44, 16 November 2015 (UTC)\n\nHi, thanks for having a look over and improving some of the sources. I imagine the Bristol Post allowed CVS to upload the article, or maybe they did it like a guest blog and that's why 'CVS Surveyors' is the author. I have found this link which is better: http:\/\/www.egi.co.uk\/news\/eg-awards-2014-the-winners\/. I can't find any links (apart from CVS owned) which illustrates CVS' client base to go with the Aston Martin reference. I'm not sure about the deadline, I think it did come into force. Any more thoughts? I will make the above amends. [[User:Sirdreamer|Sirdreamer]] ([[User talk:Sirdreamer|talk]]) 17:02, 17 November 2015 (UTC)\n\nHi, as per above. I have amended the sources with two new ones which are completely independent. I have also taken out the reference to Aston Martin as I can't find anything online. Thanks for your help.

You could submit the article- if it gets declined I'll have a go at adding to it to try and make the case for notability. I'm a bit busy with RL at the moment (it reduces my \"thinking capacity\"!).

There seems to be evidence that Reddy does exist and that he does run a business- however the article seems to me to be intended to give credence to certain untruths, and was possibly more damaging than the normal promotional article. What your actions did was to delay the deletion of the article- I tried to tag the second creation with A7 after you removed my tag but the Wiki software prevented it from being tagged- how the other editor managed to tag it I don't know.

The movie is an adaption of [[Ernest Claes]]' novel [[De Witte (novel)|De Witte]]. It stars [[Eric Clerckx]], [[Willy Vandermeulen]], [[Blanka Heirman]], [[Paul S Jongers]], [[Luc Philips]] and [[Paul-Emile Van Royen]]. It is the second adaption of the book. The other movie was released in 1934 as [[De Witte (film)|De Witte]].\n\nThe title ''Whitey'' refers to the nickname of the main character: Louis Verheyden, a blond naughty boy of eleven year.\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie is set in and around [[Zichem|Sichem]] in 1901. Louis Verheyden, 11 years old, lives with his parents and two brothers on a farm. His mother is a complaining woman. Father works at the farm of landowner Coene. He is mostly only home during dinner. He is a rather aggressive man and beats Louis frequently. Furthermore Louis is bullied by his brothers Nis and Heinke.\n\nLouis hates school. This is mostly caused as their teacher is a very hard man who likes to punish his pupils. Corporal punishment was not yet forbidden those days and the children are cuffed on the ears or put into the choal chamber by the teachers.\n\nLouis is a naughty boy. He gives others incorrect directions, tries to haggle of money from his brothers, ties up persons to their chairs during church service, steals smoking materials from Coene, gives his family members instructions to put salt onto the potatoes (resulting they are salted three times), chases off the horses of Coene, ... Louis is almost caught every time which results in another punishment. His most humiliated punishment was when he went swimming in river [[Demer]] although this was forbidden by his parents. When his mother arrived at the river, Louis hid and his friends tried to deceive mother by telling they did not see Louis. However, mother found his clothes and took them away. As a result, Louis had to go naked to home.\n\nLouis is sent by Coene to [[Averbode Abbey]] to deliver a package. There he is impressed by the beautiful interior, the Gregorian singing, the garden full of flowers and the printing establishment.\n\nOne day, Louis is again punished by his teacher and put on the cellar. There he finds some books written by [[Hendrik Conscience]]. His attention goes to the book [[De Leeuw van Vlaanderen (novel)|De Leeuw van Vlaanderen]] ''(translated as 'The Lion of Flanders')'' and handles about the [[Battle of the Golden Spurs]]. The story fascinates him and he needles up his friends to replay a fight scene. Some injured children run to their home. Their mothers and the local priest come to the battle. Louis, wholly engrossed in his role as warrior [[Jan Breydel]], is even not aware he just started a \"sword battle\" with the priest.\n\nDesperated, mother sends Louis and Heinke on pilgrimage hoping the Lord will turn Louis into a well-behaving boy. They end up in a street fight between the police and supporters of the socialism and have to flee into a pub. However, the pub seems to be owned by socialists. Heinke, a catholic, tries to impress the female bartender by telling he also supports the socialism. Louis thinks this is blasphemy and threatens Heinke he will inform his girlfriend Liza.\n\nIt's the annual fair and Louis deceives his brother by telling him his mother has promised to give 15 Belgian Cents. At the fair, Louis meets his mother. Louis complains he has no money, resulting he gets some more pocket money. Of course, mother finds out Louis was given money twice. His father is furious and demands his son must work for Coene to retrieve the money or must be sent to a community home. Meanwhile two incidents happen: Louis tries to commit suicide in river Demer whilst Liza ends her relationship with Heinke. Last action ends up in a fight in a [[spiegeltent]] where the funfair ball takes place.\n\nThe movie is then set to 1980 where a blond student, resembling to Louis ''(it is actually actor Eric Clerckx with another haircut''), is working in the printing establishment of Averbode Abbay. When he drops a box, he is scolded by his boss. In the box is the 117th reprint of novel \"Whitey\".\n\n==Reception==\nThe movie was received with mixed feelings. It has a score 6.6\/10 on IMDB.COM whereas it got a 4.5\/5 on rotten tomatoes.\n\n==Differences from the novel==\nThere are some differences from the novel. The love story between Heinke and Liza is not in the original story neither Louis' suicide attempt. Louis does not go with his brother on pilgrimage. Instead, he goes with his father to the city to buy a cap for his [[holy communion]]. At the end of the book, it is also clear Louis applied with success for a job at the printing establishment of Averbode Abbay but the time is of course still set at the beginning of 1900 whereas the film ends up in 1980.\n\n==Awards==\n*1980: The movie both won the award of the jury and the public's favorite at the journ\u00e9es cin\u00e9matographiques d'Orleans.<ref name=\"trailer\">[http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?gl=BE&v=mh1Unw8mKP4 Trailler De Witte van Sichem]<\/ref>\n*1981: Grande Premio \"Janela de Prat\" Tomar<ref name=\"trailer\"\/>\n*1982: Award of the Jury, the media at the youth international film festival Caen<ref name=\"trailer\"\/>\n*1982: Golden Award Festival Internationale del Cinema Giffoni<ref name=\"trailer\"\/>\n\n==Nominated==\nNominated at the film festivals of Montreal, Dublin, Berlin, Miami, New Delhi, Moskou, Tel-Aviv and Mannheim.<ref name=\"trailer\"\/>\n\n==External links==\n*[http:\/\/www.rottentomatoes.com\/m\/de-witte\/ Whithey at Rotten Tomatoes]\n*[http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0081765\/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 Whithey at IMDB.COM]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Belgian films]]\n[[Category:Dutch-language films]]\n[[Category:1980 films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Belgium]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Ernest Claes]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1900s]]\n[[Category:Child characters in film]]","timestamp":"20160410104433","user-timestamp":"20150410104433"},{"title":"User talk:92.20.81.241","content":"== March 2013 ==\n[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Hello, I'm [[User:Charlesdrakew|Charlesdrakew]].

Although there are lots of factors which have to address before considering power generation form hydrogen like, hydrogen power economy and safety associated with accidental explosion. Lots of analytic studies of combustion process (ignition) above crossover temperature are studied [1, 2], however in this report we have investigated hydrogen-oxygen reaction phenomena that comprises deflagration, flame balls, diffusion flames and ignition (spontaneous and forced). Hydrogen-oxygen combustion at steady state is easier than the oxidation of other fuel due to it requires fewer species and fewer elementary steps  for ignition [3].\n'''1.1\tBrief Introduction'''''Italic text''\nChemical kinetics  is the study of the speed (rate) where chemical reaction takes place and the speed which is affected by the factors. Three Step Reaction is step by step of elementary reaction process till the third steps that occurs on a molecular level in chemical reactions. In the elementary reaction process, more than one or more molecules are changing their geometry and\/or disturbing molecules by eliminating or adding another reactant molecule that consist of multiple elementary processes. However, there are different factors which has to keep in mind while determining the rate of reaction such as concentration, surface area, temperature, and catalysts [4].\nThree-Step Mechanism\n2 A + 2 B \uf0e0 C + D\nStep 1:  A + A \uf0e0 X           \t\t(fast) \nStep 2:  X + B\uf0e0  C + Y   \t\t(slow) \nStep 3:  Y + B\uf0e0 D        \t\t(fast)\n\n''1.2\tObjective of three step chemical kinetics studies'''''Bold text'''\n-\tAnalysis of the overall reaction sequence of elementary steps.\nFor example: The Steady-State Approximation\n-\tDetermination of absolute rate of reaction and its individual elementary steps.\nAccording to discussion given in [3, 5] suggested that   at steady state assumption is a reasonable approximation for three step than other steps (four) chemistry when the homogeneous ignition of hydrogen-oxygen mixture under the crossover temperature and pressure at initial condition. In the reduction mechanism, includes , ,    and  , design by using skeletal mechanism of eight elementary step under the steady state condition [5]. \nHO2 consumption through  occurs fast to take place this intermediate at required low temperature, thus further reducing into two global steps  and . This processes compiled with effective temperature sensitivity of corresponding overall rates that assists the activation energy  asymptotics is used to explain the resulted thermal runaway, and ignition time for different initial temperature, pressure, and composition. \n\n''2\tReduced three step mechanism for autoignitio'''''Bold text'''n \nFrom many discussion given in [5, 6], ignition processes explained by the overall reaction  with ignition time   increase linearly. The chain termination via  becomes significant at low temperature (M is third body as an energy carriers [7]), increases induction time [8], the reaction rate parameter is included in table called San-Diego mechanism [9]. Most interesting things is to be noticed that chain termination via.  includes in chain branching at temperatures at below crossover [5] and other hand alternative branched chain path enables to ignite via  ,  therefore eight elementary reactions is needed for low temperature description which is shown in Table 1 [5], for the numerical validation H atom will be removed rapidly through  , at steady state ignition below crossover condition and final result can be adduced as three steps [10].\n \n \n \nIn the numerical integrations of adiabatic, isobaric homogeneous reactors, the result found using three step mechanism which are plotted and compared in Fig. 1.\n\n \nFigure 1: solid line indicates ignition time with 21-step detailed chemistry and dashed curve indicates three step reduced mechanism [5].\nFrom the discussion given in [5], activation energies and Arrhenius rate constant (k8) are very large and the results shown in Figure 2 corresponding to hydrogen and air combustion  at different pressure. And resulted equivalence ratios within flammability condition range changes form very lean to very rich mixtures, where we have noticed that temperature and error at very lean mixtures has directly proportional relationship.\n\n \nFigure 2: Below crossover temperature of hydrogen-oxygen ignition. Left-hand-side indicates variation of ignition time with equivalence ratio and right-hand-side indicates by dashed line experimentally determined explosion limits of hydrogen-oxygen and solid line representing analytic prediction developed by third explosion [8].\n3\tConclusion \nFrom the many studies, the chemical kinetics of hydrogen-air combustion below crossover, ignition delay varies inversely with pressure and directly with temperature. The studies found that the tested ignition delay has been used to foresee accurate ignition time that are 20 % better than wide range of pressures, temperature and compositions. \n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1]\tR.

INAUGURACI\u00d3N TRAYECTO FERROCARRIL DE ALGECIRAS A JIMENA DE LA FRONTERA]<\/ref> Es una infraestructura de car\u00e1cter radial que permite comunicar la ciudad con el interior.\n\nEl Ayuntamiento de [[Ronda (M\u00e1laga)|Ronda]] propuso, para el desarrollo de la ciudad y la comarca de la [[Serran\u00eda de Ronda]], que el trazado entre Algeciras y el interior de la pen\u00ednsula tuviese una estaci\u00f3n en Ronda, en detrimento de la opci\u00f3n litoral entre [[M\u00e1laga]] y [[Algeciras (Espa\u00f1a)|Algeciras]]. A d\u00eda de hoy no hay [[Corredor de la Costa del Sol|conexi\u00f3n ferroviaria]] directa entre estas dos \u00faltimas ciudades, aunque est\u00e1 en fase de proyecto su construcci\u00f3n.\n\nSe eligi\u00f3, a partir de Ronda, un trazado que sigue el valle del [[R\u00edo Guadiaro]], hasta [[San Pablo de Buceite]]. El resto del trayecto es llano hasta Algeciras.\n\n== Situaci\u00f3n actual ==\nActualmente esta v\u00eda es \u00fanica y sin electrificar, lo que supone, junto a su trazado, unas velocidades de trayecto bajas. Sin embargo, es muy utilizado para los viajes entre Algeciras y los destinos que ofrece, al ser competitivo con respecto al [[autob\u00fas|transporte p\u00fablico terrestre]].\n\nEl principal objetivo de esta v\u00eda f\u00e9rrea es comunicar el centro de la Pen\u00ednsula con el principal puerto del pa\u00eds, el [[Puerto Bah\u00eda de Algeciras]]. Por lo tanto es habitual el paso de trenes de mercanc\u00edas por esta v\u00eda.\n\n[[Renfe Operadora|Renfe]] ofrece servicios de pasajeros entre [[Madrid]] y Algeciras, donde esperan ferrys con destino a [[Ceuta]] y [[T\u00e1nger]], al otro lado del [[Estrecho de Gibraltar]]. Estos trenes entran a Andaluc\u00eda por el [[NAFA]] y realizan parada en [[Ciudad Real]], [[Puertollano]], [[C\u00f3rdoba (Espa\u00f1a)|C\u00f3rdoba]], [[Antequera-Santa Ana]] y [[Ronda (M\u00e1laga)|Ronda]] en su trayecto, que dura 5 horas y 27 minutos.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, por esta v\u00eda circulan diariamente trenes de media distancia que comunican Algeciras con [[Granada]] pasando por Bobadilla y Antequera. Este servicio realiza parada en todas las estaciones activas del esquema. El tiempo m\u00ednimo empleado por este tren es de 4 horas y 20 minutos.\n\n== Modernizaci\u00f3n ==\nEn el Plan de Estrat\u00e9gico de Infraestructuras y Transporte figura el Ferrocarril Bobadilla-Algeciras como uno de los elementos a modernizar, para adaptarlo a la [[alta velocidad]]. El proyecto se ha dividido en dos fases:\n\n=== Antequera-Ronda ===\nEntre la estaci\u00f3n de alta velocidad [[Antequera-Santa Ana]] y Ronda se construir\u00e1n dos nuevas v\u00edas en ancho internacional de 70 km de longitud, con velocidad de 300 km\/h y sin estaciones intermedias.\n\nEn el t\u00e9rmino municipal de Ronda se construir\u00e1 una variante que evitar\u00e1 la actual traves\u00eda en forma de \"Z\". La [[Estaci\u00f3n de Ronda-La Indiana]], actualmente fuera de servicio, ser\u00e1 recuperada para funcionar como estaci\u00f3n de alta velocidad de Ronda.\n\nPor la v\u00eda de alta velocidad, un [[tren de alta velocidad]] tardar\u00e1 20 minutos entre Antequera-Santa Ana y Ronda, frente a los 62 actuales.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Ante la imposibilidad de buscar una v\u00eda alternativa por la dif\u00edcil orograf\u00eda del terreno, se ha optado finalmente por adaptar la v\u00eda existente a la alta velocidad. La velocidad de proyecto para estos tramos es de 160 km\/h.\n\nEn el tramo entre Ronda y [[San Pablo de Buceite]], La v\u00eda ha sido totalmente renovada, con un tercer ra\u00edl que permitir\u00e1 tanto el paso de trenes UIC como de ancho ib\u00e9rico, de forma similar a lo realizado en la [[LAV Zaragoza-Huesca]]. Los 14 t\u00faneles del tramo han sido adaptados, impermeabilizados y protegidos contra da\u00f1os derivados de desprendimientos. Se han construido dos nuevos viaductos y cuatro falsos t\u00faneles entre Cortes de la Frontera y Gauc\u00edn.

As a former member of the team (1979-1980), I could not help but laugh at those players you felt warranted mention in this article. Chemba Lanuaza???? What a stiff!!! And Papote Agosto and Papirito Leon?? These guys you consider reknowned?? What about the person who their arena is named after, Mr. Pachin Vicens himself? He was only the greatest point guard in Puerto Rican history. And his nephew, Michael Vicens, who made a name for himself playing at Boston University? Then there's Joe Hatton, whose son Bobby Joe now plays on the National team. There are others: Angel \"Conejo\" Garcia, Cesar Bocachica Sr.(how can you mention his son and not him?), Richie Hernandez, Josean Baez, et al. None of those players you mention could hold a candle next to these guys, much less compete with them.\nIf you're going to make the effort to create an information source such as this, you'd be doing all your readers a better service by doing some extra homework and knowing more about your subject matter. \nPedro Acevedo\nWestbury, NY\n\n:Even though I'm not the author of the article... as a resident of Ponce, and therefore a fan of the team since my childhood (I live two blocks away from the Auditorium) I agree with you on most of your case. However, your mention of Papote Agosto stands out to me, as I consider him to be a great player in his time and a focal part of what was then known as \"Los Cuatro Jinetes del Apocalipsis\" (with To\u00f1ito, Bobby, and Charlie.) Also, since I agree with you about Pach\u00edn, and I also consider the lack of mentioning his name in the article to be a crass mistake, I was trying to come up with some facts about him on the net, but (sadly!) I couldn't find any. Anyway, since I just came up to this article, I will try to work with it and improve its quality. I already added the logo and cleaned some links and added others, to make the article more readable. Anyway, feel free to leave here or in [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User_talk:Thief12 my Talk Page] any suggestions for the article. Thanks!

Part of [[Hisar division]], it lies {{convert|12|km}} north of the district headquarters Bhiwani and {{convert|249|km}} form the  state capital [[Chandigarh]]. {{As of|2011|alt=As of the [[2011 Census of India]]}}, the village had 1,448 households with a total population of 7,434 of which 4,002 were male and 3,432 female.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pur  village|url=http:\/\/www.censusindia.gov.in\/pca\/SearchDetails.aspx?Id=62775|publisher=[[Census of India]]|accessdate=31 July 2015}}<\/ref>\n\n==Archaeological site==\nThe nearby archeological site dates to the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] (7,500\u20132,600 BCE). It was excavated in 1968 by the archaeologist, [[Suraj Bhan (archaeologist)|Suraj Bhan]].<ref name=\"frontline\">{{cite web | url=http:\/\/www.frontline.in\/static\/html\/fl2717\/stories\/20100827271712700.htm | title=People's historian | publisher=Frontline | date=14 August 2010 | accessdate=24 November 2014 | author=Habib, Irfan | authorlink=Irfan Habib}}<\/ref>\n\nMitathal is situated on the alluvial plain near a channel between the [[Chautang]] and the [[Yamuna]] Rivers and is {{convert|25|to|30|km}} from the hilly outcrops of Kaliana and Tosham, which are rich in quartzite and meta-volcanic rocks respectively. The site lies approximately {{convert|120|km}} west-northwest of New Delhi, {{convert|10|km}} northeast of the district headquarters [[Bhiwani]] and {{convert|1.5|km}} northwest of Mitathal village\n\n===Historical significance===\nMitathal is an important site for scholars investigating what Possehl (1992) has called the \"Eastern Domain\" of the Indus Valley or [[Harappa]]n Civilization. A brief surface reconnaissance was undertaken during a visit to the site by the authors of this paper on 11{{nbsp}}March 2007. The geologic provenance of several\nartefact types, including the first and only steatite seal yet recovered at Mitathal, was also assessed. These new studies have provided a fresh glimpse into this ancient settlement and the surrounding region during the later part of what is commonly termed the Mature Harappan period (ca. 2600-1900 B.C) of the Indus Valley Civilization.\n\n===Location and past research===\npre-Mature [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappan]]\n\nMature Harappan\n\nPeriod I -c. 2000-1900 B.C.\n\nPeriod II- c. 1900-1500 B.C. \n\nPrior to excavation conducted by [[Kurukshetra University]] in 1968, under the direction of Suraj Bhan (Bhan 1969, 1975), copper artefacts, Indus-style pottery, beads and faience bangles were discovered at Mitathal. Bhan\u2019s excavations, although small in scale, revealed much about the site and the region. Firstly, a pre-Mature Harappan phase related to the Kalibangan I and \u2018pre-defense\u2019 (Kot Diji Phase) at the site of Harappa, which in Haryana has been called the Late Siswal culture, was identified. This was followed by a continuous sequence through a Late Harappan phase. Bhan defined a Period I and Period II \u2013 c. 2000-1900 B.C. and c. 1900-1500 B.C., respectively. The classical phase of the Indus Civilization (Mature Harappan) was indicated at the site by the presence of well-planned mud-brick structures, beads of carnelian, faience, steatite and terracotta, toy-cart wheels, wheeled toys, sling balls, discs with tapering ends, marbles and triangular cakes of terracotta as well as stone objects such as balls, hammer stones, saddle querns and mullers, and cubical stone weights. The uppermost level (IIB) was designated the \u201cMitathal\u201d culture (Late Harappan). Some Siswal\/ Kalibangan ceramic traditions survived and important finds from this phase include a celt, a ''parasu'' or axe, copper harpoon and a copper ring, which are known as Copper Hoards.<ref>[http:\/\/www.revenueharyana.gov.in\/html\/gazeteers\/hrygazI\/Hr-Gaz-Ch-2.htm Haryana State Gazeteer]<\/ref> Bhan suggested that Indus culture transformed into the OCP and hinted that the possible genesis of the OCP lay in the Siswal phase (Bhan 1975: 3). Mitathal\u2019s twin mounds were christened as 1 and 2 by Suraj Bhan. He recorded Mound 1 as being 150 x 130 m in area and 5 m in height, while Mound 2 was 300 x 175 m in area and 3 m above the agricultural fields. The two mounds whose northern periphery was demarcated by a modern irrigation canal (the Dang Minor) were 10 m apart.\n\n===Surface reconnaissance===\n{{original research section|date=July 2015}}\nIt was evident, both from visits to Mitathal and from an examination of recent Google Earth satellite imagery (ca. December 2005), that large portions of the mounds have been destroyed since the time of Bhan\u2019s excavation due to agricultural activities. Mound 1 has been reduced greatly on its south and to a little extent on its north.\n\nOn the south, the mound was levelled for nearly {{convert|40|m}} and a section of nearly {{convert|1|m}} is exposed. Mound 2 has likewise suffered extensive damage. A huge chunk measuring roughly {{convert|50|x|50|m}} has been lost on its eastern side just in the past few years. Although this ongoing destruction is lamentable, it has provided a wealth of fresh archaeological materials for surface investigation. When walking across Mitathal one is struck by the large number of blue-green faience bangle fragments visible on the site\u2019s surface. Most are so fragmentary that their complete forms are difficult to judge. Nine examples worthy of shape determination are documented in Figure 2. Bangle 1 has a triangular section and is without any decoration, while Bangles 2 and 4 are incised with diagonal lines with triangular and ovular sections respectively. Bangles 5 and 6 have spiked triangular sections and small pinched spike motifs. Bangles 3, 7, 8 and 9 have broadly similar horizontal banding and rectangular sections. \n\nIf we take these surface decorations into account, parallels are found for Bangle types 2 and 4 in the Harappa Phase (Period 3) levels at Harappa (Kenoyer 1992: 87, Fig. 3), while Bangle 5 and 6 have parallels in some terracotta bangles from the same site and period. The horizontal incised designs are not described among the major faience bangle styles from Harappa. Further analysis of faience bangles from Harappa and other Indus Civilization settlements like Mitathal may reveal evolutionary patterns and regional variations, if any. Ash pits and kilns of considerable size were observed on the northwestern and eastern peripheries of the site. One among these was a feature that is suspected to be a series of faience kilns. \nThe surface evidence indicates an elliptical spread of furnaces in an east-west direction. The furnace walls exhibit vitrification indicative of extremely high temperature craft activities. In his discussion of Indus faience production Kenoyer mentions (1994: 37) the discovery of white rocky quartz at the site of Harappa,which might have been the raw material crushed to make the silica powder. Our exploration of Mitathal also yielded examples of white rocky quartz. Its presence along with the kilns and the unusually large numbers of faience antiquities (both from the past excavation and from this surface reconnaissance) suggests that Mitathal might have been a major faience production centre. Other common surface finds were non-diagnostic bits of copper and identifiable copper-alloy objects such as bangle fragments (Fig. 4). Likewise abundant were non-diagnostic fragments (Fig. 5), broken pieces and a few complete examples (see Shinde et al. 2008, Fig. 87) of stone querns and mullers. The large majority of these stone artefacts were composed of a reddish-coloured quartzite with distinctive thin black seams.\n\n===Harappan Seal===\nThe most significant find by our team was of a broken steatite seal. It was found on the southern slope of Mound 2 not far from the canal. Suraj Bhan\u2019s excavation report makes note of a seal (Bhan 1975: 82, Fig. 16) collected from the surface of Rakhi Shahpur ([[Rakhigarhi]]), but no seal or sealing had previously been reported from Mitathal itself. The seal recovered is rectangular in shape, trapezoidal in section and inscribed on one side. The surviving portion measures 15.50 x 14.51&nbsp;mm. The section of the top and bottom suggests that it was, when complete, convex backed with a perforated hole through the width. Seals of this type were used at the site of Harappa only during Period 3C (Meadow and Kenoyer 2001: 27) and this surface is dated  to ca. 2100-1900 BC or the later part of what is commonly called the Mature Harappan Phase of the Indus Valley Civilization composed of seven vertical strokes\/bars \u2013 having four strokes in the first row and three in the second. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the first sign was performed at the Department of Materials and Metallurgical Engineering, IIT, Kanpur and suggested that the seal\u2019s deeply incised characters were created with a sharp-edged metal tool.\n\n==See also==\nThe Ancient Indus Valley : New Perspectrives, by Jane McIntosh (2008).ABC-CLIO,Santa Barbara, California.

Flight 1 was a regularly scheduled TWA [[Sun Racer]] flight from [[Newark, New Jersey]] to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] with almost a dozen intermediate stops between. Approaching the flight's second stop, [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]'s [[Allegheny County Airport]], pilot Otto Ferguson lost contact with the airport's [[radio navigation]] signal, and tracked several miles in a southwestern line off course.  Fearing icing conditions, he descended in an attempt to find visual landmarks for navigation. Thick fog hindered him, and his descent continued until Flight 1 hit ice-covered trees atop [[Cheat Mountain]], about {{convert|40|mi|km}} south of Pittsburgh on the [[West Virginia]] line and near [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania]].  When the plane crashed it was aiming in a northern flight direction indicating that the pilot finally realized he had tracked south of his flightplan and may have been trying to correct it (the flight should have been aimed due west not north or hours prior south-southwest).<ref>http:\/\/www.time.com\/time\/magazine\/article\/0,9171,848531,00.html<\/ref>\n\nThe plane's two pilots were killed instantly, as were several passengers.

The [[Bureau of Air Commerce]], predecessor to the modern [[Federal Aviation Administration]], was put in charge of the investigation, but TWA sent independent investigators as well. Bad weather was pointed to as an early suspect,<ref name=\"crash story\"\/> and TWA backed the idea that a faulty radio beacon was to blame,<ref>\"TWA leans to view beam was faulty\", ''The New York Times''. April 9, 1936. Page 2.<\/ref> resuming an argument that had begun in February, when TWA's president testified to the U.S. Congress that airplane radio beacons were being poorly maintained.<ref name=\"Time\"\/>\n\nAt the crash scene, investigators measured the plane's slide and found the DC-2 had cut a swath more than {{convert|200|ft|m}} long, indicating the plane had been going at a fast pace rather than a landing speed.<ref name=\"crash story\"\/> Interviews with Nellie Granger established the plane had not been readied for landing, indicating pilot Ferguson did not believe he was in a final descent.<ref name=\"inquiry\"\/> Government tests revealed the landing beam was not faulty, but TWA refused to accept those results and was persuaded only when independent testing confirmed the results.<ref name=\"Time\"\/>\n\nMajor R. W. Schroeder of the Department of Commerce said, \"In my opinion the cause of this catastrophe will never be known,\"<ref name=\"Time\"\/> but investigators gradually uncovered the truth through interviews with people who had seen the plane's course diverge from schedule. In the end, the Bureau of Air Commerce concluded pilot Ferguson was at fault and demonstrated \"poor judgment\" by descending to a dangerous altitude in an attempt to navigate visually. By the time he realized his mistake, ice buildup on the plane's wings prevented it from gaining enough altitude to avoid the mountain.<ref name=\"government report\"\/><ref name=\"Time\"\/><ref name=\"story\">[http:\/\/select.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=F50F10F73C59167B93C1A91782D85F428385F9&scp=1 \"Air pilot blamed in crash killing 12\"], ''The New York Times''. September 3, 1936. Page 14.<\/ref> TWA disagreed with the report's conclusions but did not offer an alternative explanation.<ref name=\"story\"\/>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nIn 1935, the Bureau of Air Commerce encouraged a group of airlines to establish the first three centers for providing air traffic control along the airways. Following the crash, the Bureau itself took over the centers and began to expand the network, leading to the development of the modern [[air traffic control]] system.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nFor her efforts, flight attendant Nellie Granger from nearby [[Dravosburg, Pennsylvania]] was acclaimed as a hero. She was profiled by the ''[[New York Times]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'', and TWA promoted her to the top position among its flight attendants.<ref name=\"promotion\">[http:\/\/select.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=FA0C17FE3F5A107A93C3A8178FD85F428385F9&scp=1 \"Airline promotes heroine of crash\"], ''The New York Times''.

Genuine biographies are cross checked and verified.  You do not just write down what the person tells you that they are.  Moret is a master of self-promotion, she is not a whistleblower, she was not the Berkeley Environmental Commissioner (she was one of nine citizen members of the Community Environmental Advisory Commission and I am glad to see that minutes of that Commission have now been posted in the bio, she is not a Geoscientist (she was the President of the fledgling Association of Women Geoscientist, which has formally cautioned her to not use their name as an endorsement of Moret's false claims about depleted uranium and atmospheric nuclear testing ( I expect that they would also demand no association with the false claims about High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) [www.haarp.alaska.edu], tectonic warfare, Fukushima, etc.  Moret has had a tendency to use \"me too\" and follow claims made by Rosalie Bertell or Christopher Busby and then add embellishments.  Her claim about the late Nobel Laureate Dr Glenn T. Seaborg having been so obsessed with the discovery of Plutonium (she adds by his assistants and his just taking the credit) that he carried a piece of Plutonium in his pocket and constantly fingered it turning his hands to claws should all by itself be grounds for Moret to be consigned to the conspiracy nut file.  She has co-authorship of three geologic research papers, all of whom were derived from the doctoral research of colleagues.  She was given the co-authorship because her skilled used of the new Differential Scanning Calorimeter instrument was critical to their research.  She has not authored any scientific papers herself and only has one actual published paper in World Affairs, The Journal of International Issues, an obscure Indian journal that is carried in a number of college libraries.  It is quite clear that the article, Depleted Uranium: The Trojan Horse of Nuclear War\u201d, July 1, 2004, never was critically reviewed by anyone with any scientific knowledge.  I invite you to watch the video of her presentation at the 9\/11 Truth Conference in Vancouver, British Columbia.  She claims that a worldwide epidemic of diabetes is caused by the depleted uranium cloud that comes from the DU use in the Gulf War and in Iraq and Afghanistan (DU was most likely never used in Afghanistan, that atmospheric testing caused reduced SAT scores, and later on has the claim about Dr Glenn T Seaborg (she starts with a news clip that is totally false) http:\/\/video.google.com\/videoplay?docid=-5145492019596709070# [[User:Rhotel1|Rhotel1]] ([[User talk:Rhotel1|talk]]) 23:07, 28 March 2012 (UTC)\n\n:Dear Roger, I'm not quite sure what the purpose of your message is. You say she is a conspiracy theorist, and the article says that, too. You say that she makes strange claims about many things, and the article says that, too. You say she is not a credible scientist. The article does not say that because Wikipedians take reliable sources for constructing articles, and this claim has never been made in reliable sources. Your inside information cannot be used for the article on [[Leuren Moret]] because our [[WP:OR|original research policy]] forbids that.\n:I had taken my eyes off this article last year because I am here to write an encyclopedia, not to endlessly argue about some biography of very little importance and prominence.

However, many of the students are attached to their school, their village, and want to write articles on them. \n:We have a lot of unreferenced submissions and frankly, I do not know what else to do. In the lecture I point it out, the study guide has a fifteen-page chapter on Wikipedia and what it takes to have own content accepted, the tutors are supposed to address it again. Some students get most things right and deliver work like [[Nico Kaiyamo|this]], others ([[User:Emilly212022318|example]]) get just about everything wrong.

Before you write down a fact in an article, you should have a source for it, otherwise it's no good adding it. I agree populated places are Notable by default if they can be proven to exist, but in many cases we can't prove much at all beyond simple existence, a set of grid coordinates, what district it's in, etc. Though, if folks are insistent on doing their own villages, maybe they can at least add a good photograph of the village itself? But probably best no more than one lest it turn into some odd Facebook page. \n::I don't know about Namibia, but India has a great gadget in its infobox that automatically makes a map of the location of a town\/village if you plug in its coordinates, so even some of the lowest-skill articles have great maps, see for example [[Nakoda]]. Just a suggestion, though I do agree that it's hard to stay objective writing about one's own home-town. [[User:MatthewVanitas|MatthewVanitas]] ([[User talk:MatthewVanitas|talk]]) 22:44, 12 October 2012 (UTC)\n:::My personal minimum is one credible source and some information where exactly it is situated. I do take my own GPS coordinates if I have nothing else, but that is of course Original Research. It is still principally verifiable, that's why I have a clear conscience ;)  We do have a push pin map for Namibia, see e.g. [[Onderombapa]] for an example. There are always two possible strategies: Wait until you have enough sources to write a decent article, or put something online with the hope that some day, someone comes along to improve it. The latter path is actually not as opportunistic as it sounds: the next source to be published maybe does not say where the settlement is situated, so it cannot really be used stand-alone. However, if there already is a stub containing the exact location, new info can just be added. --[[User:Pgallert|Pgallert]] ([[User talk:Pgallert\/Archive2012 1#top|talk]]) 10:30, 13 October 2012 (UTC)\n\n==DYK nomination?==\nHi, Pgallert!

An example of a good group is [[Wikipedia:School and university projects\/Polytechnic of Namibia\/Information Competence, September 2012\/Geo-Information Technology]], even if most submissions still need to be wikified. On the other side we have our distance students at [[Wikipedia:School and university projects\/Polytechnic of Namibia\/Information Competence, September 2012\/Distance students (COLL)]] where I haven't seen much useful content yet. Even the tutor cannot leave his signature on the page... Of course, with almost a thousand participants we will always have 5 or 10 that get themselves blocked.

Your tutors seriously need to work on getting this information across to their charges. I and presumably other editors are having to spend excessive amounts of time clearing up after students who are, in effect, breaking the law, and given the hundreds of students and thousands of contributions involved, this is no easy task. I've now looked at the contributions of perhaps twenty to thirty of these students - ''not once'' have I encountered anything that would make a noteable improvement to Wikipedia, and in most the cases I've seen, they have violated either at least one of the [[WP:CCPOL|core content policies]] or the site's [[WP:COPYRIGHT|copyright terms]]. I'm not trying to lay blame at your door, just expressing my frustration at the fact that so much time is being invested (by the students and by Wikipedia editors and administrators) for so very negligable a result.\n\nIn other news, I've not found a better way of dealing with content copying than that outlined in the discussion we had on my talkpage recently; if students attribute content with their first edit summary, that will suffice - just - to skirt the copyright issue.

I noted the huge influx of Namibia articles so figured there must be an outreach there, and tracked down your project and page. Of the AFC submissions, I've approved a good 10 or so Namibia articles that were at least \"minimal threshold\" for publication as-is, and hopefully those students will continue to improve them in their coursework. I've found a few that simply weren't sourced well, or were opinion pieces vice informative articles, but seeing the frustrations on your talk page I just wanted to note that some of your students are doing a really proper job.\n\nI don't recall exactly which ones I've approved ([[Caves of Namibia]] is a great first try), but if you like I can drop you a running tally as I run across more publish-worthy (though all still requiring further improvement) Namibia articles.

One of the toughest topics to get through to my students is [[WP:ENC]]. Believe it or not, if I ask a class of 380 who ever has seen or touched or used an encyclopedia, or knows someone who owns one (including Encarta), zero hands go up, unless I happen to have an exchange student from America or Europe. Most students do not even know the word. It is difficult for them to understand why [[Pastor rapes three children]] is unencyclopedic while [[2012 Namibia church scandal]] is not. I'm still looking fo a clever way to introduce this topic. --[[User:Pgallert|Pgallert]] ([[User talk:Pgallert\/Archive2012 1#top|talk]]) 10:43, 13 October 2012 (UTC)\n\n===Topic choices===\nI'll do some pondering on it, but for future iterations it may ''really'' help to make topic proposal and approval a significant phase, with tutors willing to make a clear call as to suitability. I'm seeing some of the following:\n*Topics that already exist: if it's a world-famous celebrity, car, tourist site in France, etc. there's probably already an article about it\n*Redundant student topics: there appear to be five or more students trying to write on [[Olufuko festival]], about as many trying some version of \"Baby dumping in Namibia\" with varying levels of success, and a few duplicates for various schools and villages, where there is no Wikipedia article yet, but the way things are heading one student article will pass AFC and the others will end up being declined as \"already exists\" if they aren't the first one.\n*Some opinion pieces of basically blog entries: several articles about \"how I feel about being a twin\", \"whether compulsory voting is a good idea\", etc.\n\nSo as you note, some clarity on [[WP:EC]] and [[WP:NOT]] might be a good initial focus, lest students waste weeks trying to develop something that can never be an article, that already exists, or fighting with other students for who gets published first on the same topic. [[User:MatthewVanitas|MatthewVanitas]] ([[User talk:MatthewVanitas|talk]]) 23:09, 13 October 2012 (UTC)\n:Prevention of duplications is not really feasible, I fear. It is not just the task of coordinating 900 student submissions across 40 different groups, but also the 2000-odd already existing articles, just about Namibian topics.\n:But that might not be necessary at all. The minimum requirement for the assignment, as it is now, is the addition of one statement in proper English and encyclopedic tone, neutrally worded, formatted according to Wikipedia's custom, and backed by one reliable, independent source. Article creation is thus not necessary, and if I have 5 submissions on Olukonda, then their combined content and sourcing will perhaps give the material for a decent stub on it.\n: All those essay-type submissions stem from  the situation that their course, Information Competence, starts off with an essay. Students want to re-use it. In future, we will have to stress more clearly that no essay from assignment 1 can ever be used for assignment 3 (WP). --[[User:Pgallert|Pgallert]] ([[User talk:Pgallert\/Archive2012 1#top|talk]]) 08:34, 14 October 2012 (UTC)\n\n== Hello, from another ambassador ==\n\nHi there!<br>\nIt looks like you've got a lot of work in your in-tray at the moment.

A ten minute or quarter hour session flicking through there might give them a better idea of what an encyclopaedia is. At CSD we get a lot of people who, I'm quite sure, don't know what an encyclopaedia is (but who can find their way round Facebook and Twitter far better than I could). I might write a little essay about what an encyclopaedia is and does. In the meantime, have you seen [[WP:PRIMER]]? This was set up as an intro for beginners, and is excellent. There again, it may not be so for students who have never seen an encyclopaedia. I've worked with kids of assorted abilities, including an eight year old cousin who was delighted to receive a grown-up dictionary for her birthday (\"It's got a THEEZ-orus in it! I NEED one of them!\") and a fourteen year old inner city kid who had to do something to a fairy tale for English homework, and who didn't know any fairy tales (and she and her two street-wise mates were crying at my sad telling of ''The Ugly Duckling''). Let me know what you think - and what sort of approach might work best. [[User:Peridon|Peridon]] ([[User talk:Peridon|talk]]) 15:25, 14 October 2012 (UTC)\n:That's an interesting idea. I tend to get articles at [[Special:Random]] that I wasn't looking for. If I want to show how much can still be improved at Wikipedia, I get five MILHIST A-class warships in a row, if I want to show what a range of topics WP covers I get one Indian village after another. But that's maybe Murphy's Law. \n:The gist of all WP introduction is to spend considerable time reading before submitting articles. That is unfortunately something most students cannot, or do not want to, do. They have other assignments, and once the Wikipedia stuff is coming their way, they look for an easy way to get it off their list. If I knew how to change this, I could solve quite a variety of other educational problems. --[[User:Pgallert|Pgallert]] ([[User talk:Pgallert\/Archive2012 1#top|talk]]) 13:08, 15 October 2012 (UTC)\n\n== Slow connections ==\n\nI sympathise with your problems of slow connections as described on your user page.

Another one had three words to say in motivation of her oppose, despite the fact that I spent some 30K of virtual ink on explaining why \"not an administrator\" can actually be a feature rather than a bug.\n:Wikipedia isn't ready yet for a non-admin in ArbCom. That is a bit sad, too, as it reinforces the uber-editor position of administrators, with all its negative byproducts like a hostile RfA atmosphere, cabal and caste accusations. There are by far not enough protest voters, which I consider the only vehicle to make this happen one day. Alas, I left a number of respected administrators behind me, I got a few encouraging comments, and I will contribute as I have before. I never really expected to become elected, and [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Namibia]] will be better off with me as editor. --[[User:Pgallert|Pgallert]] ([[User talk:Pgallert#top|talk]]) 14:08, 19 December 2012 (UTC)\n::I don't think that's entirely fair: the guide writers tend to mirror the community rather than influence them, I think, and I'm sure that \"not an admin\" is viewed as an unsurmountable hurdle by most.  The problem is that &mdash; despite all of RFA's flaws &mdash; the process ''is'' a reasonably accurate assessment of \"has been around a while, understands policy, and isn't obviously batshit insane\".  It may not be the only way to demonstrate those qualities (or even the best), but it's one most people recognize and agree upon.  &mdash;&nbsp;[[User:Coren|Coren]]&nbsp;<sup>[[User Talk:Coren|(talk)]]<\/sup> 17:17, 19 December 2012 (UTC)\n:::Page view statistics show that voters' guides have double the readership than candidate question pages. This does suggest to me that voters rely more on secondary sources than candidates' own statements, and that puts quite some responsibility on the writers of such guides. I don't bemoan my also-ran result. I might be happier without that burden. But I wish that AGF were applied more generally, and that editors with 10K contributions, no blocks, no warnings, and 4.5 years' tenure, shouldn't need to prove that they are sane.\n:::There is one aspect in which guide writers represent the community rather well: That is the paradoxical situation that the majority of them wishes for a revolution but at the same time make recommendations that at best represent evolution. How often did I read \"ArbCom had it all wrong in 20XX\", and yet the same editors, or at least the same types of editors, long-serving, non-controversial admins, get support recommendations all the time, and get the popular vote. Had I understood this earlier, I would not have bothered to run. It is quite clear that I am not as well established. But again, it is not sour grapes at all, and I have to thank new and \"old\" sitting Arbs for their dedication to the project. --[[User:Pgallert|Pgallert]] ([[User talk:Pgallert#top|talk]]) 11:53, 20 December 2012 (UTC)\n::::I think the driving sentiment here is \"the evil you know\"; you see the same thing in (Western world) real world elections time and time again: people gripe and moan, but they see the system as working ''mostly'' right and fear that in upsetting it too much they'd end up with something worse.  &mdash;&nbsp;[[User:Coren|Coren]]&nbsp;<sup>[[User Talk:Coren|(talk)]]<\/sup> 13:05, 20 December 2012 (UTC)\n::::And ''please'' don't regret running.

Commins.  Here statues of prominent citizens, an avenue of stately mausoleums and a collection of headstones tell the story of Akron\u2019s past.  Originally known as Akron Rural Cemetery, Commins modeled the design of the cemetery after Boston\u2019s Mount Auburn Cemetery, which he visited in 1838. \n\nGlendale is a picturesque romantic landscape with its curving roads, use of promontories to create vistas and a variety of architectural styles that draw upon ancient building forms. Mausoleums are modeled after Egyptian, Greek and Roman temples or Gothic churches. Nineteenth-century accounts described Glendale as \u201cbeautifully laid out in romantic drives and walks\u201d and note its role as an area park and tourist destination.\n\nOriginally, the cemetery had a stream and two bodies of water\u2014Willow and Swan Lakes. Due to the increased development surrounding the cemetery during the late 19th century, the natural spring that fed the lakes dried up. The superintendent of the cemetery at that time proposed running a pipe to the Ohio and Erie Canal to re-water the lakes, but this was never realized. Today the open space or Great Meadow recalls the scale of Swan Lake and several mausoleums have small foot bridges that once crossed over the stream fronting them. \n\nDistinct sections of the cemetery are devoted to the Masons, Akron\u2019s Jewish community and infants and children. The Civil War is prominently commemorated in Glendale Cemetery. The Buckley Post of the Union Army has a large memorial marker surrounded by 50 headstones located on the northern plateau. The 1876 Gothic Revival style Memorial Chapel was constructed by the Buckley Post and has been recently restored.\nhttp:\/\/www.nps.gov\/history\/Nr\/travel\/ohioeriecanal\/gle.htm","timestamp":"20160410104504","user-timestamp":0},{"title":"User talk:86.177.16.83","content":"\n\n== May 2009 ==\n[[Image:Information.svg|25px]] Welcome to Wikipedia.

The paper was founded in 1939 by Kenneth McCaleb, a student at what was then Joplin Junior College. The newspaper is printed weekly during the fall and spring semesters, for a total of 24 issues a year, and is written, edited and graphically designed by Missouri Southern students.\n\n== Structure ==\nThe newspaper falls under the university's department of communications and offers credit hours, along with hands-on experience, to students on its staff. Though owned by and receiving partial operations funding from Missouri Southern, ''The Chart's'' editorial content is selected, written and edited entirely by student staff. A majority of the students who serve on ''The Chart'' staff are communications majors, though the staff is open to students of all majors if they fulfill a set of prerequisites as prescribed by the newspaper's adviser. Students majoring in English, history, art, business and various other fields have all served in various capacities on ''The Chart''. The positions a student might have the opportunity to hold on the staff include editor, staff writer, copyeditor, graphic designer, cartoonist, advertising staff and photographer.\n\nEditors, writers and photographers write and produce the 12- to 14-page broadsheet newspaper. The newsroom contains some of the area\u2019s most up-to-date hardware and software to help prepare students for the professional arena. Students can advance quickly through the ranks of ''The Chart''. Editors qualify for performing aid awards (scholarships) and student help funding as well as other scholarships designed to encourage students to pursue careers in print journalism.\n\n''The Chart'' primarily focuses on campus news, sports, events, people and issues, but coverage also branches out to community, state, national and international stories. Until 2011, ''The Chart'' stationed a student editor at the Missouri State Capitol each spring during the General Assembly. Many state legislators and college and university presidents read the newspaper in the 1980s and 1990s for the latest information on Missouri s higher education. Upper-level editors have taken their knowledge and experience around the globe. Past editors traveled to China, Latin America, Germany, France, Japan, Cuba and Russia, and upon their return, have produced award-winning news supplements and magazines.\n\n== History ==\nAs a student at Missouri Southern\u2019s predecessor Joplin Junior College, Kenneth McCaleb (1920-2002) saw a need for a student newspaper. In the fall of 1939, the first issue of The Chart appeared on the school\u2019s campus. McCaleb had chosen the name ''The Chart'' to serve as a scale to measure the school\u2019s success, having only been founded in 1937.\n\nIn its early years, ''The Chart'' had numerous faculty members serve as advisers to it and it fell under the jurisdiction of the English department. In 1948, Cleetis Headlee (1911-2000), professor of English and journalism, took the position as faculty adviser of the newspaper. It was during her tenure that the publication went on to win its first statewide awards. Headlee, known as being a stickler for accuracy, served in that role for 19 years, before stepping down in 1967, though she continued serving as an English professor at the college until retiring in 1976.\n\nAfter Headlee\u2019s departure as adviser, the quality and funding for ''The Chart'' degraded significantly. But the 1972 arrival of Richard Massa (1932-) to serve as adviser brought the newspaper new life. Massa used his early time as adviser to rebuild the staff and work on securing adequate funding. Through his leadership, the student staff was bringing in major awards within just a few years. Massa used the success of ''The Chart'' as seed for a new college department and in 1980 the department of communications was created, with Massa serving as director, a title he held until his retirement in 1999.  \n\nAs Massa\u2019s duties increased with the new department, he hired a former ''Chart'' editor-in-chief to replace him as adviser. Chad Stebbins (1960-), who graduated from Missouri Southern in 1982, took on the role as adviser in 1984 and continued the legacy of success that had been instilled by Headlee and Massa before him. Under his watch, ''The Chart'' twice won the [[Society of Professional Journalists]]\u2019 best in the nation award for a non-daily college newspaper. In 1999, the [[College Media Advisers]] named Stebbins the National Newspaper Adviser of the Year. Stebbins' close watch of ''The Chart'' continued until 1999, when he was promoted to be director of the university's Institute of International Studies. Since that time, the role of publications manager (a professional staff position) has handled most of the day-to-day management of the student staff. T.R. Hanrahan (1964-), another former ''Chart'' editor-in-chief, served as publications manager from 2006 until 2011. Olive Sullivan (1960-) was named faculty adviser to ''The Chart'' in August 2011.\n\n== The McCaleb Initiative for Peace ==\nIn 1998, ''Chart'' founder Kenneth McCaleb and his wife, Margaret Baughman McCaleb established the McCaleb Initiative for Peace at Missouri Southern State University for the purpose of examining the causes of war and discussing ways by which war can be prevented.\nMcCaleb, who had been a prisoner of war in Germany during [[World War II]], directed that the focus of the Initiative be on Missouri Southern student journalists who, on assignments for ''The Chart'', will, during the lifetime of the Initiative, visit sites of former wars and perhaps present conflicts. They will visit monuments to past victories and defeats and visit with survivors of wars, and they will write and publish their observations. These reporters will compile memories of veterans of battles, of prisoner of war camps, of concentration camps, of resettlement camps, of refugee centers, and of those who worked or officiated at such centers. They will detail in their reporting the devastation wreaked by war. They will visit institutes where the study of war and the promotion of peace are principal concerns, and they shall report upon their findings.\nIn so doing, ''The Chart'' will strive to become an instrument for peace and create for its readers, particularly for the students of Missouri Southern State University, vivid notions of the horrors of war.\n\n== Awards ==\nThe Missouri College Media Association named ''The Chart'' Best in State six times in 11 years: 1994, 1996, 1997, 2001, 2003 and 2004. ''The Chart'' has won multiple Associated Collegiate Press Pacemakers, both at the regional and national level. For 1995 and 1996, ''The Chart'' was named the best non-daily college newspaper in the nation by the Society of Professional Journalists.\n\n== Hall of Fame ==\n''The Chart'' inducted McCaleb, Headlee, Jack Brannan, and Massa into its first Hall of Fame class in 2012. Additional members will be inducted every five years. In November 2014, ''The Chart'' dedicated a Hall of Fame area on the third floor of Webster Hall with members of the MSSU Board of Regents in attendance. The Hall of Fame includes McCaleb's original typewriter, pictures of the four inductees, and other artifacts.\n\n== Notable ''Chart'' Alumni ==\nRon Martin \u2014 Retired Editor, ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]''\n\nJack Brannan \u2014 Retired, [[United Press International]], [[New York Stock Exchange]], ''[[Tulsa World]]''\n\nPam Johnson \u2014 Executive Director, Donald W.

The following is task 3: (loading the page now)\nAlright, we've covered fixing minor things, and citing sources, so let's start making some major improvements to articles. Though there are many different things, we'll just go to [[Wikipedia:Cleanup]], which is a big list of articles needing cleanup. You'll also want to find an article that could use more information, a [[WP:STUB|stub]] would be the best for this, as they are already short, and could always use more complete information. Now, on to the assignment. \n===Assignment:===\nNOTE: For this step, I'm a bit vague, because this is just putting all the stuff you've learned together, and just telling you to add some information. BUT if you need any help, just leave me a message on my [[User talk:HAL2008|talk page]]. \n<s>First, find an article that needs cleanup on that list, and figure out what's wrong with it. Try to avoid using articles that need sources for this assignment, but by all means add sources to those anyway. Try to do things that need to cooperate with [[WP:STYLE|style guidelines]], or articles that have large amounts of incorrect information, etc. Remember to site any new information that you add. You don't have to fix the WHOLE article, if it's short, then go for it, if it's long, only do a section. If you WANT to fix the whole thing, by all means, do it!<\/s>\n##UPDATE: Excellent job! You added a lot of information, and fixed the article up a lot. I personally think it's a few minor things away from coming off the cleanup list, but don't worry, you just concentrate on the stub, I'll take care of that article.\n#Now, find an article that needs more information, like a [[WP:STUB|stub]] article, or even an established article that lacks some information. Add some information, properly reference it, and save the page. \n#Send me the diff, and we'll move on!\n'''NOTE!'''

Get it? Illustrations? Lack of unnecessary quote marks (\"\"tessen\"\", \"\"gunsen\"\" - see, HERE I'm actually quoting - quoting you, so I am using quote marks to show you your stupid quote marks!) and repeating how everything is \"Japanese (samurai)\"? Properly made references, with italics in the titles, and capital letters in the titles (instead of in \"By\"), and spaces after references? Without repeating the whole references repeatedly? Everything else? Christ, I mean, it's crazy I even have to tell you this. It's just... so obvious, and elementary! Now, MAKE THE COMMONS CATEGORIES OR PAGES, so you will then use [[Template:Commons]] - and that's all! Sorry, I couldn't explain it tou any in any MORE simple way than this. --[[User:Asperchu|Asperchu]] ([[User talk:Asperchu#top|talk]]) 07:47, 24 November 2010 (UTC)\nAnyone can edit...wiki is about providing information and when you remove pictures and the information they contain you are removing information. Galleries are used on wiki to provide additional information. There are many types of war fans and jutte, pictures of the different types and styles are helpful to people who are actually trying to find information. You do not seem to have any real knowledge on either war fans or jutte when it comes to the actual historical items.  Why dont you read some of the books that are referenced and actually learn something so you can contribute.  If your interest is just in the popular culture then contribute to that and leave the historical aspect alone as you do not seem to know what people are looking for when they come to wiki for information. If you had bothered to even look you would see that the pictures are already stored on commons. You think that editing wars contribute to the article?  How would you like it if I start to edit your articles that interest you even though I do not have enough knowledge on the subject?  Most of the articles I contribute to have litte or no references and it takes a lot of time and effort to find reliable references the validate the information, ANYONE can edit but most people can not do some research and find worth while references. You probably do not even know why some jutte are samurai and others are not. The way you go about editing and the way you talk to people does nothing to help..stop thinking you are such an expert, maybe you will get alone with other people if you are not so confrontational.  <small><span class=\"autosigned\">\u2014Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Samuraiantiqueworld|Samuraiantiqueworld]] ([[User talk:Samuraiantiqueworld|talk]] \u2022 [[Special:Contributions\/Samuraiantiqueworld|contribs]]) 11:44, 25 November 2010 (UTC)<\/span><\/small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\n:However, appearently \"anyone\" can not even sign their comments.

Your friend, [[User:Hodja Nasreddin|Biophys]] ([[User talk:Hodja Nasreddin|talk]]) 14:26, 7 December 2010 (UTC)\n\nOh, hi. I just mailed Alex, explaing myself and stuff to come clean about at last. If he won't reply, I'll just post it here, and well, probably move. And I mean, I'll move on... to another account, and we'll continue our silly game. Except it may end anyway, because now I'll probably do something like just get a dynamic IP address and whenever I'll need an account I'll get a new account every time too :). I mean, no biggie. If I'll quit Wikipedia when I decide so, and no would even notice this too, it fits me just fine. I'm honest about this, because I don't care, I have nothing to hide right now. Maybe I can be restored as a normal user, maybe not, either way I'll be ok. Also I'm sure I almost always make good work here, almost because everyone makes some mistakes (sometimes I even keep correcting my various mistakes I did here years ago, and yet no one did anything about them in the meantime). I like when an article is well done and even looking good, that what counts for me, I don't really need anything else. You know how the superheroes almost always hide their actual identitity? Something like that :). It's not like I'd be paid for this here anyway. Maybe I'd be paid for it somewhere else, but... ok, suddenly I'm now less cheerful about it, so scratch that.\n\nBtw, I don't know if there's a good will and actual neutrality on his side, though, and I'm especially curious why a guy I didn't know (Offliner): 1. knew about me in first place (among, um, millions of the other users), 2. knew about me SO MUCH, 3. knew perfectly well where to go with this, how strange. But whatever, right now I'm \"assuming good faith\". Also, I'm cool about it, not even really annoyed, much more interested about several Russian users' motivation and what they think about me (like, maybe I'm perceived as a threat or some kind?), maybe I should actually remember Alex and Offliner too, but I just forgot (never forget). I'd really like to know, this might be amusing. Or maybe I'm just paranoid? who knows :). --[[User:Asperchu|Asperchu]] ([[User talk:Asperchu#top|talk]]) 15:36, 7 December 2010 (UTC)\n\n:We talked before about [[Wikipedia:Standard offer]]. Other than that, I am not going to comment, but strongly advise you not to mail anything to anyone because this can be regarded as harassment. If you want to discuss your ban, this should be done through official channels, such as mailing list of Arbcom.[[User:Hodja Nasreddin|Biophys]] ([[User talk:Hodja Nasreddin|talk]]) 17:49, 7 December 2010 (UTC)\n\n::Oh, I think these were rather friendly e-mails. Besides being honest, but nothing abusive, I'm pretty chilled about this you know. If I don't get an answer I publish here, so you'll see (I guess I'm going to wait 2 days or something). I just wonder, should I know Alex but I forgot? All this name is only telling me is he's blocking me every time :). But I hardly remember almost anyone I interact here with, so it's possible (I don't think I could name even 10 users now). And I don't even know what is the Arbcom, I was never interested in such things. If you want to mail me personally about this or anything, you can do this by clicking now. Won't be no harassment :). --[[User:Asperchu|Asperchu]] ([[User talk:Asperchu#top|talk]]) 18:29, 7 December 2010 (UTC)\n\nAnyeway ok, I won't be sending any more of these e-mails unless I get a reply. --[[User:Asperchu|Asperchu]] ([[User talk:Asperchu#top|talk]]) 18:37, 7 December 2010 (UTC)\n:Yes, Arbcom would not help because you was banned by a community decision. So, the \"standard offer\" might be your only option. But I tell you this. You contributed a lot to the project. This is great. But there are certain [[Wikipedia:Sock puppetry|RULES]]. By showing disrespect to the rules you show a disrespect to the project and its participants. This is not the way. However sad, you must accept it. There are many other things to do with your life. If the community does not want to see you here (however wrong they might be about you), why should you insist? There is Russian saying: \"An uninvited guest is worse than a [[Batu Khan|tartar]]\". We are guests here, so let's behave. Sorry if it sounds crude.[[User:Hodja Nasreddin|Biophys]] ([[User talk:Hodja Nasreddin|talk]]) 19:29, 7 December 2010 (UTC)\n\n::Oh, yeah. And the one of these guys who decided about this was a sock-pupped of a banned user too :). I mean, [[User_talk:Rudie_M.|seriously]]. But, I'm actually not saying the initial ban was wrong. I freaked-out major time and appaearently even demanded to be banned or something, it's quite emberassing to look at so I'd rather not. Also, Tatars can be okay if treated right. [[Polish Tatars]] are some of the finest soldiers we have for a very long time. They were also the largest Muslim community here until recently (it is Chechens now), because they eventually almost all assimilated and lost their national identity. Also I just love writing about stuff on Wikipedia. I can't help it. And on the various Wikipedia-like websites (various user names), like the Wikias, or Encyclopedia Dramatica, even CWCki where I actually did more edits this year than I did on Wikipedia, but if you don't know what CWCki is, I guess it's just better for you, and I mean it :). --[[User:Asperchu|Asperchu]] ([[User talk:Asperchu#top|talk]]) 19:42, 7 December 2010 (UTC)\n:::Do not waste your time.

Unlike you, administrators must follow the rules. Almost any administrator will tell you that he can not undo the community decision. But if you or anyone else places a new ANI request asking to modify your ban right now, this will not have a chance for approval because you just was caught socking.\n\nYou ask to modify your ban, but you tell that you are not going to abide by the rules at the same time. You tell you improved, but you have a recent block for incivility.\n\nSadly enough, you are a highly knowledgeable and surprisingly neutral content contributor, but you have problems interacting with others. When someone suddenly reverts you in an article (and that is how all your and my conflicts started), you suppose do the following: (a) do not revert him back; (b) assume [[WP:AGF]] on his part and explain him (without any sarcasm!) your edit; this usually works when another editor is acting in a good faith but does not have a clue  about the subject; (c) leave article to others if you can not come to an agreement.

Anyway no matter what I will probably simply continue to edit, unless I decide otherwise. This is the first and the last time I'm trying to straight up it this way. I was never interested in any administrative stuff, or any social stuff on Wikipedia, I'm just interested in good editing in every meaning of this, this the thing I'm doing practically non-stop since about 2004 I and will probably keep on for many years to come still, this way or another. Yes I'm pretty much addicted to this stuff.\n\nRegarding my edits, you can for example ask Subzerosmokerain. He and I used to have a major argument, really disagreed with reverting each other and what not, however: 1. it turned out I was right, 2. I think we're pretty much bros now since whet it was cleared out. The thing is he's a really huge MK fan, as even his name indicates, and in the last months I also completely rewrote most of the related articles of all kinds. You can ask him for an expert opinion about the quality of these \"new\" articles now, or you can take a look at some of them (Category:Mortal Kombat) yourself. I also did a similar thing with most Resident Evil articles at the roughly the same time too, and much more (lots of stuff). I didn't finish doing this yet, too. I recently got access to almost literally tons of old magazines and I keep researching in them, and I already got a plenty of references that I didn't use yet.\n\nSo, my proposal is to let me  back on some kind of probation, even indefinite. I'd like to show you, and myself, I can behave like some  model citizen of Wikiville after all when properly motivated. The details would be for discussion, but for example I can promise I'd make no use of a fake account to go around this like for example to attack someone (I never did something like that, just saying), and the point is: if I do anything bad again anyway (from a list of stuff I can't do, and what I should do instead, so I will know), you'd be just ban me again, this time for good... and then I'll just quietly revert to my normal ways (but this time with a dynamic IP so there would be no further disruptions). Sorry, I'm sicere here. But I'd just prefer it this way, legally. I guess it would be better for everyone. It would be easier for me, and for everyone else. It would be also much more satysfying.\n\nI'd like to also indicate I'm just so completely honest about everything here, and everyone too for that matter. It's just how it is. I just edited-out some of my thoughts regarding Alex's possible motivations that now appear to be unfounded, so I won't throw it around. I also won't cite his responses here, if he wants he can say whatever he wants himself.\n\n===1===\n\nHello!\n\nYeah yeah, it was me. Again, yes. Hi. Guess this time I'll write to you and try to talk to you. (Am I talking to you for the first time now? Frankly, I just don't remember.) So here we go.\n\nIt was you who banned me in first place, right? And keep banning me since then? Okay, I'll now assume you're doing it with no hidden agenda whatsoever, and you're doing this just to make Wikipedia a better encyclopedia and keep the vandals out. So now I'm going explain myself and to show you why it's better to have me around by showcasing of the good work I do (and I do lots, as my longest account was once at 300-something place for edits among the all users there at the time).\n\nHere, there is some of the recent work that I'm proud of (there was of course much much more and it's just examples as I said - I took a look at my recent edits and chose some of them):\n\n[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Battle_of_Iwo_Jima&oldid=399893086] -> [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Battle_of_Iwo_Jima&oldid=400806147] (general cleanup + restoring long-lost content (the text was actually cut-in mid-sentence), also some work in the related articles, like as a cleanup on [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/320_mm_Type_98_mortar] and such)\n\n[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=The_Samurai_(TV_series)&oldid=391626653] -> [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=The_Samurai_(TV_series)&oldid=400851339] (general cleanup\/rewrite, also merged the 2 very old character articles that just needed to be merged)\n\n[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Kirigakure_Saiz%C5%8D&oldid=313422524] -> [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Kirigakure_Saiz\u014d&oldid=400838862] (here, it's MAJOR!

Because that's simply what I think I am. It's 5-6 (I don't remember) years of continued experience, tens (hundreds now?) of thousands of edits and untold thousands of hours spent on them, also a LOT of knowledge on a number of subjects and morever I know how to research stuff (this is not an obvious skill), etc. I'm always concerned that the article should be NPOV, sourced, as complete as possible but without doubling the stuff elsewhere, properly written in every sense AND easy to read, even visually pleasing. Actually I'm even obsessive over such things like outdated internal links (leading to redirects), this is a very minor thing but I'm often  checking  all of them and updating anyway, in short I'm trying the best I can and I think I succeed. Maybe it's strange for a \"rogue\" user, I don't care.\n\nOK, that's all. That is, assuming that your concern as an administrator is only in the quality of Wikipedia, and not anything else. I know nothing about you and drankly I'm not at all interested (as well as in everyone else on Wikipedia). Myself, I just believe I'm doing a good job and valuable contributions here, and I will continue doing it unless I decide (and then bring myself) to stop editing, or the life matters will force me (which actually is quite probable, stuff happens). Now stopping editing would be actually a good for me, but this is up to me, only, not you. And you probably already know this. You can now decide to quit the game we two are playing, or just explain to me your reasons. Let's discuss this any way, shall we?\n\n===3===\nRegarding my original ban. I just checked out, and it wasn't you (sorry, I didn't remember any of this at all). It was by someone who since then has since left Wikipedia. Maybe more importantely, actually the person who I appareantly had a beef with which sparked all of this (I think it started with an edit war with him), later turned out to be...a sock puppet of a banned user, which I guess is super-ironic. (I never had anyone banned after I was banned, or before this too as far as I remember.) It would mean I was totally right in this dispute to begin with, before it went totally out of control from my side. You can check this out, maybe it changes much. Also, when I've seen it, I freely admit I behaved stupid. I was way too angry and I was actually vulgar too (against an admin?) maybe drunk, I don't know, it's certainly very embarrassing when I look at it now. Appearently I had some kind of fit and actively wanted to be banned. Obviously I changed my mind on this since then. Also, almost 3 years passed. I did a LOT of good work since then, and never had any drama like that.\n\nAbout the guy I mentioned, he said: \"I think we've been very patient with him for a long time. If he can't learn to be polite, then there's no place for him on Wikipedia.\" - and, wow: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User_talk:Rudie_M.]. I didn't even know this until now, but i think it's crazy someone like this was taking part in administrative proceedings (regarding me). As I said, it's so ironic. The guy who actually banned me (\"being highly productive does not give one the right to be uncivil.\", now I can say he was right) is gone: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Rlevse], but I'm still around and since then i grew up. And due to more experience, even my editing became much better. Sometimes I even find my old articles and I cleanup after myself. An example (a quick cleanup of a bad case of overlink from the time when I've been linking everything like crazy, and \"See also\" should be for thing not mentioned in the article - encountered it again recently): [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Grozny_OMON_fratricide_incident&action=historysubmit&diff=398875377&oldid=391725382]. Yes it's the subject which you'd be interested in, but I think it has an article on the Russian wikipedia or just I couldn't find one. A similar cleanup of an overlink, this time not mine and more important, I wanted to do today at the Battle of Little Bighorn, including a plenty of simply wrong links in the one-word Indian names in the sections \"Indian leaders and warriors in the battle\" and \"Notable scouts\/interpreters in the battle\" (I already did the general cleanup for this article before: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Battle_of_the_Little_Bighorn&action=historysubmit&diff=396481470&oldid=396081216], but didn't realized this one until I've seen it again - there's planty of simple links on the names like Goose, linking obviously to the article on goose the animal species, and such - I'd remove all of them and also the red links too).\n\n[ommited part]\n\n--[[User:Asperchu|Asperchu]] ([[User talk:Asperchu#top|talk]]) 11:37, 8 December 2010 (UTC)","timestamp":"20160410104511","user-timestamp":"20150410104511"},{"title":"Mykhaylo Sokolovsky","content":"{{Infobox football biography\n| name = Mykhaylo Sokolovsky\n| fullname = Mykhaylo Ivanovich Sokolovsky\n| image = Mykhaylo Sokolovsky.jpeg\n| image_size = 200\n| birth_date = {{birth date and age|1951|11|15}} \n| birth_place = [[Sloviansk]], [[Soviet Union]]\n| height = {{height|m=1.73}}\n| currentclub = [[FC Metalurh Donetsk|Metalurh D]] (scout)\n| clubnumber = \n| position = [[Midfielder]]\/[[Striker (association football)|Striker]]\n| youthyears1 = \n| youthclubs1 = \n| years1 = 1970 \n| years2 = 1971 \n| years3 = 1972 \n| years4 = 1973 \n| years5 = 1974\u20131987 \n| years6 = 1988\n| clubs1 = Avanhard \n| clubs2 = [[SKA Kyiv]] \n| clubs3 = [[SKA Kyiv|Chernihiv]] \n| clubs4 = [[FC Metalurh Zaporizhya|Metalurh Z]] \n| clubs5 = [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar]] \n| clubs6 = [[FC Krystal Kherson|Krystal]]\n| caps1 = 40  \n| caps2 = 9  \n| caps3 = 35  \n| caps4 = 38  \n| caps5 = 400  \n| caps6 = 45  \n| goals1 = 1  \n| goals2 = 1  \n| goals3 = 11  \n| goals4 = 5  \n| goals5 = 87  \n| goals6 = 3 \n| nationalyears1 = \n| nationalteam1 = \n| nationalcaps1 = \n| nationalgoals1 = \n| manageryears1 = 1995-1996 \n| manageryears2 = 1999\n| managerclubs1 = [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar]] (assistant)\n| managerclubs2 = [[FC Metalurh Donetsk|Metalurh D]]\n| pcupdate = \n| ntupdate =\n}}\n'''Mykhaylo Ivanovich Sokolovsky''' ({{lang-uk|\u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0439\u043b\u043e \u0406\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0421\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439}}; {{lang-ru|\u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0421\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439}}; born November 15, 1951) is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] professional [[Association football|football]] coach and a former player.

Some statements are more important than others; for instance a lot of the stuff in the characteristics section we can get away with because of the samples and the many artists we've referenced as being part of the genre. Also some parts like the opening sentences of the 2006 bit are spoken for by the rest of the section, as that reads like \"make a few statements, then give your reasoning\" prose. I know this is advised against in some cases (let the facts speak for themselves, says [[WP:NPOV]]) but this seems pretty harmless and just makes the article read better, which is crucial for an FA.

I did block him in the past, but he was unblocked rather quickly. Ben received a large number of warnings and a lot of advice, but he failed to heed the warnings and, for the most part, ignored the advice. Basically, he wore the patience of many editors thin. You can read more about the different justifications for the block on his talk page. You should also note that, until he posted attempting to vilify me, I was offering him advice on what to do to get unblocked and even trying to defend his actions. If you look at the whole thing objectively, you'll see I was very supportive of him, and was actually very lenient in the early block in an attempt to give him the message that the way he was behaving was not appropriate. As you can see from [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=block&page=User:Bjaco18 his block log], he was then blocked by several other admins for various different things, and finally blocked indefinitely by Gwernol. After this, he continued to ignore my advice, and even claimed that I had not let him get over his first block\/failed to help him out, which is patent nonsense. As I say, if you want a more in-depth discussion about why he was blocked, you should go and read his talk page, but, basically, Bjaco continued to be disruptive and behave in a way that was completely inappropriate and caused a lot of work for others, despite much advice and guidance (which he ignored) and many warnings, which he did not heed, from many different admins and other experienced users. He has also shown a level of immaturity. If you genuinely feel that Bjaco should not have been blocked after you have looked into his actions and read the discussion, you are welcome to discuss the matter with me on my talk page.

The article seems similar in structure to other articles about comics\/TV shows\/movies\/etc., so I'm not sure precisely what improvement is being requested.

I can do additional searching to improve the article, if you point me in the right direction. :)\n\nIs article text available during DRv? How?\n\n[[User:Sim|Sim]] ([[User talk:Sim|talk]]) 14:35, 29 November 2010 (UTC)\n*While I don't have a really good example to show you was a model, I can say that I would be looking at the number of independent sources that are not the comic itself, as well as the prominence of the sources cited, and the range of sources they came from (i.e. having 5 different articles from 5 different newspapers is better than having 5 articles from the same newspaper). For example, the [[Xkcd]] article deals with a notable webcomic and cites, among other sources, this [http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2008\/05\/26\/business\/media\/26link.html?_r=1 New York Times article]. That's a great source for establishing notability, but I don't expect all webcomics to be able to establish notability through a New York Times article. And, conversely, the 50 or so citations to Xkcd.com itself in the [[Xkcd]] article don't do anything to establish notability. I am not looking so much for more footnotes describing the sources for all the plot material at this time, because first I would be looking for footnotes establishing that this comic is one I should pay attention to at all. Only after that has been established would I suggest going into detail about the plot. For further guidance, see [[WP:WEB]].

This was an Associated Press article, widely republished, from late winter of 2006.\n\nThe Associated Press had submitted various FOIA requests for information about the Guantanamo captives.  The DoD did not comply with those FOIA requests.  They declined, but not under a national security claim, which probably would have succeeded.  They declined, claiming they were withholding the information to protect the captives' privacy.  US District Court Judge Jed Rakoff ruled against the DoD, ordering them to publish all the information by 6pm 2006-3-3.\nThe DoD only partially complied.  They released the transcripts, which were only identified by an ID number.  But they withheld all their lists which matched the ID numbers to the captives' names.  That list wasn't published for another six weeks.\n\nA couple of dozen captives, including Wali Mohammed, had their name uttered during the course of their Tribunals, and so those couple of dozen captives could be identified by name.\nThe Associated Press published a long article that devoted a couple of paragraphs summarizing what the Tribunal transcript said about the captives who could be identified by name.  \n\nBack in 2006 I didn't expect WTOP to go 404.  A year or two ago, after it went 404, I spent some time searching for other publications that reprinted the AP profiles.  Unfortunately, different publications often retitle AP stories.  And, in this particular instance, publications generally left ''some'' captives out, to make the stories fit in the space they had available.  I just looked for the alternate publications.  In the time I had available I didn't find any.  With more effort I think I could find one, or a couple.  \n\nHold the presses, I [http:\/\/hosted.ap.org\/dynamic\/external\/onlinenews.ap.org\/gtmo\/results.php?pageNum_rs_gitmo=2&totalRows_rs_gitmo=50&Submit=Submit&SITE=DCSAS&country=Afghanistan found a copy].  \n{{quotation|Wali Mohammad said he was handed over to the Americans by Pakistani intelligence agents because he would not pay a bribe. He sold clothing, exchanged currency and had other businesses but owed $1.1 million to 40 people when he was arrested Jan. 24, 2002. He denied that he was in business with the Taliban, smuggled gold for al-Qaida or facilitated transfers from accounts controlled by bin Laden to buy surface-to-air missiles. One witness, who said he had been Afghanistan's transportation minister, said Wali Mohammad borrowed $1.5 million from the Central Bank in 1997-98 but lost it in the foreign exchange market.}}\nReading it now it is clear that Wali Mohammed was not the Transport Minister.  He was a senior financier.  The witness the AP story refers to -- he would have been the Transport Minister.  AP is reporting that the bad debt Wali Mohammed incurred  was discussed at the Taliban's cabinet level.  I think that is notable.  IIRC the debt was Taliban regime funds that Wali Mohammed, a trusted financier,  had access to for one purpose, but which he used for unauthorized currency speculation in the foreign funds market.  I think this would make him the closest thing Taliban era Afghanistan had to a Bernie Madoff.

Right now I'm not sure exactly what you should do to improve the article. --[[User:Metropolitan90|Metropolitan90]] [[User talk:Metropolitan90|(talk)]] 02:37, 12 December 2010 (UTC)\n\n== Thanks ==\n\nI've come here to thank you.\nAs I [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Fences_and_windows&diff=402167272&oldid=401979787 wrote here], it has been my experience that practically no one who has disagreed with me over whether the OARDEC memos should be regarded as [[WP:RS]] was prepared to spare the time to read my counter-arguments, and offer a civil and courteous reply.  \n\nYou were a rare exception.  I am trying to remember whether anyone else at all took that step.\n\nLet me thank you for that.  I appreciated it at the time.  And I have remembered your collegiality in other discussions.  Thanks!\n\nIt is possible if I were to reread your rebuttal I would be convinced today.  I am sorry to tell you that I can't remember when you offered your rebuttal, or where you offered your rebuttal.\n\nThe key point in the note in the diff I offered above is my suggestion that there should be an [[WP:RFC]] on the question of whether the OARDEC memos should be considered [[WP:RS]].  I have never initiated an RFC. Do you have any advice for me?\n\nThanks for your earlier collegiality and fairness.  And thanks in advance for considering offering further advice.\n\nCheers!

But it seems I have done so.\nOur policies are complicated, and are growing more so.  Some of those pages have recently triggered other contributors concerns.  I see myself as a good faith contributor, and I am prepared to fix those userspace pages I where I inadvertently lapsed from policy.  If they can't be fixed I would prefer to delete them myself, so I can do so in an orderly fashion, cannibalizing and re-using the non-problematic portions.\n\nUnfortunately I seem to have attracted the scrutiny of some contributors who aren't prepared to grant me the leeway [[WP:User pages]] recommends.\n\nI have several concerns over this scrutiny.  But I will ask you here about one aspect, since I saw you had already commented on timelimits, and staledrafts.  You offered the opinion that a userspace page shouldn't really be considered abandoned until that person who started it had left the project, and had been gone a year.  \n\nMy view is much closer to yours.  I presumed your comment implied some obvious provisos.  I presume your comment did not apply to userified formerly deleted material.  The consensus seems to be that previously deleted material can only be kept in userspace for a limited time, like six months.  The consensus seems to be that even previously deleted material that is being actively worked on has to go after six months.\n\nFrom your comment it seemed to me that you would agree that this six month limit should not apply to drafts of new articles.  Have I got that right?\n\nWould you agree that a userspace page, that started as an article, that was userified, after deletion, could be retained if useful elements, were retained, after removing the elements that triggered the deletion concern were removed, and it was altered so it no longer looked like an article?\n\nThanks!  [[User:Geo Swan|Geo Swan]] ([[User talk:Geo Swan|talk]]) 18:32, 13 December 2010 (UTC)\n*When I recommended allowing userspace drafts to be kept as long as the editor had not abandoned Wikipedia for a full year, I was only thinking about drafts of new articles, not content that had previously been deleted. [[WP:UP#COPIES]] says, \"Userspace is not a free web host and should not be used to indefinitely host ... deleted content .... Short term hosting of potentially valid articles and other reasonable content under development or in active use is usually acceptable (the template {{tl|userspace draft}} can be added to the top of the page to identify these).\" Whether I would recommend (at [[WP:MFD]]) keeping or deleting a userspace draft of a once-deleted article would depend, in part, on how actively the user seemed to be trying to get the article in condition to return to the mainspace. Of course, I can't speak for everyone. --[[User:Metropolitan90|Metropolitan90]] [[User talk:Metropolitan90|(talk)]] 19:44, 13 December 2010 (UTC)\n\n== Errigo deletion ==\nThanks for the heads-up on Errigo.

It was based on the [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]] [[WB-66D]] airframe, with the wing-mounted engines moved to the rear fuselage and making space for air compressors. The aircraft first flew on 18 April 1963 with [[NASA]] test pilot Jack Wells at the controls.<ref>[http:\/\/history.nasa.gov\/monograph31.pdf American X-Vehicles: An Inventory, June 2003.] Retrieved: 13 February 2007..<\/ref> Although useful testing was accomplished, the extensive maintenance of the intricate laminar-flow system caused the end of the program.\n\n==Design and development==\nLaminar-flow control is a technology that offers the potential for significant improvement in [[drag coefficient]] which would provide improvements in aircraft fuel usage, range or endurance that far exceed any known single aeronautical technology. In principle, if 80 percent of wing is laminar, then overall [[Drag (physics)|drag]] could be reduced by 25 percent. The frictional force between the air and the aircraft surface, known as viscous drag, is much larger in a turbulent [[boundary layer]] than in a laminar one. The principal type of active laminar-flow control is removal of a small amount of the boundary-layer air by suction through porous materials, multiple narrow surface slots, or small perforations ([[boundary layer suction]]).\n\nTwo major modifications were required, the first involving the standard underwing podded [[Allison J71]] engines being removed and replaced by a pair of {{convert|9490|lb-f|kN|0|abbr=on}} static thrust [[General Electric J79|General Electric XJ79-GE-13]] non-afterburning turbojets mounted in pods attached to the rear of the fuselage sides. Bleed air from the J79 engines was fed into a pair of underwing fairings, each of which housed a \"bleed-burn\" turbine which sucked the boundary layer air out through the wing slots.\n\nThe X-21A test vehicles  (''55-0408'' and ''55-0410'') also incorporated sophisticated laminar flow control systems built into a completely new wing of increased span and area, with a sweep reduced from 35\u00b0 to 30\u00b0. The wing had a multiple series of span-wise slots (800,000 in total <ref name=\"winchester\">Winchester 2005 p. 297.<\/ref>) through which turbulent boundary-layer was \"sucked in,\" resulting in a smoother laminar flow. Theoretically, reduced drag, better fuel economy and longer range could be achieved.<ref name=\"baugher\">Baugher, Joe. [http:\/\/home.att.net\/~jbaugher2\/b66_6.html Northrop X-21A]  Retrieved: 14 February 2007.<\/ref>\n\nThe forward cockpit carried a pilot and two flight engineers  while two additional flight test engineers were housed in a central fuselage bay underneath the wing.\n\n==Testing==\n[[File:X21.jpg|thumb|X-21A in testing]]\nIn initial testing there were significant problems with the porous materials and surface slots getting plugged with debris, bugs, even rain.  In certain conditions, ice crystals would form due to the rapid cooling of air over those laminar surfaces abruptly disrupting laminar flow, causing rapid melting and rapid transition back to turbulent flow.  Maximum achievement of 95 percent laminar flow over those areas was desired.<ref name=\"winchester\" \/>  However, the design effort was canceled due to the plugging problems.\n\nNevertheless, pioneering data was obtained in the X-21 flight program, including the effects of surface irregularities, boundary-layer turbulence induced by three-dimensional span-wise flow effects in the boundary layer (referred to as span-wise contamination) and degrading environmental effects such as ice crystals in the atmosphere.<ref name=\"grail\">Chambers, Joseph R.

The bonsais they had on display reminded me of little soldiers. I saw them springing to life at any minute and scampering away on those tiny, delicate roots.\nI concocted the story as I drove home but as with many good intentions it took a back seat as life took over and two children, one divorce and a change of career later meant I was too distracted to start writing.\nThat was until my family asked me what I had done with the bonsai story that I had mentioned all those years ago. I felt guilty so I made the time to put these wonderful characters down on paper. That is why the book is dedicated to my family because without their encouragement, the story would still not exist in written form.\nI hope you all enjoy reading the book as much as I enjoyed writing it.\nLet\u2019s hope that someday science can truly come up with such a miracle to help us get out of the environmental mess we find ourselves in today.\n\nTHE WORLD NEEDS A SUPERHERO WHO CAN ACTUALLY SAVE THE DAY and guess what?    We've found them!\n\nHaving trouble getting your kids to read?   Tired of reading about vampires and wizards?   Look no further! \n\nBonsai Warriors is a rollicking eco-adventure that is guaranteed to keep torches glowing under bedcovers for years to come! And yes parents, it will appeal to you too!\n\nHere's the blurb (what it's all about):\n\nWhen Henry Lewis locked himself away from the world to invent a cure for global warming even he could not have predicted the bizarre chain of events that would follow. \n\nSuddenly unable to protect his inventions, the fate of humanity and the planet itself falls onto the small shoulders of Toby, his ten year old grandson, who must protect Henry's inventions from falling into the wrong hands.\n\nBonsai Warriors is a rollicking suspense story guaranteed to keep flashlights glowing under bed covers for years to come.\n\nSo what are you waiting for?\n\nLet's get out there and make a difference!\n\nDID YOU KNOW: that Bonsai Warriors is 100% Australian made and manufactured? \nEverything to do with this book has remained on Ozzie soil so the carbon footprint is much smaller than books that are written here but printed overseas then shipped back via carbon belching vessels.\n\nSee for yourself why Bonsai Warriors is the biggest thing since Harry Potter. Here is chapter 1\n\nSomething was moving in the dark, its steps were short but fast; the breathing choppy and erratic.\nAs it brushed past shrubs with ever increasing speed, it was apparent there were more right behind it. The things scurried off into the darkness, too quick to identify. \nThey moved quickly through the grass and forested area. They seemed to know exactly where they were going and what they were doing.\nThe front gate loomed ahead, big, white and angled toward the ground. The things leapt over it without hesitation. They had done this before.\nOne of the things stopped at the edge of the roadway, looked around then whistled for the others to follow. As they crossed, they separated, each moving to a different house.\nOne of them ducked down the side of a modest looking home. It scrambled up the side of the wall and pulled itself up onto a window ledge.\nThrough the glass it saw a ten year old boy getting into bed. He struggled for breath as his mother fussed over him, handing him a Ventolin inhaler and plugging in a large machine right next to his bed. The boy took two squirts of the inhaler then lay down. His mother kissed him goodnight and turned off the bedside lamp.\nWithin seconds, the thing could hear snoring; the boy had fallen asleep. It silently pulled the boy\u2019s window open and landed softly on the carpet. It moved to the machine and watched curiously as it beeped ever so softly to indicate oxygen levels in the room. With a swift flick of a finger, the thing switched the machine off. It fell silent.\nThe boy let out a short, sharp grunt.\n\n\n\u2018He can\u2019t breathe. He can\u2019t breathe. Someone! Help me!\u2019 \nThe doors of the Reflection Bay Hospital emergency department swung open as a stretcher carrying the same ten year old boy was wheeled into the busy room already crowded with patients, doctors and nurses. His mother was right behind him looking panicked. \nThe emergency room registrar and two nurses raced to the boy and fixed an oxygen mask to his face.\n\u2018Is that you Toby?\u2019 the registrar asked.\n\u2018Hello, Dr. Nigel.\u2019 Toby mouthed through his mask.\n\u2018I\u2019m surprised to see you back here so soon! Isn\u2019t the oxygen machine working, Polly?\u2019 Dr Nigel asked Toby\u2019s mother.\n\u2018Yes. He\u2019s been doing so well lately. He wakes up and he\u2019s so healthy. I can\u2019t understand this,\u2019 Polly sobbed.\nDr Nigel placed a comforting hand on Toby\u2019s shoulders. \u2018Why don\u2019t you tell me what happened.\u201d\n\u2018I was walking to school and I dropped my ball in the bushes. I went in to get it and then I couldn\u2019t breathe again.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t understand. What could have caused this?\u2019 Polly wasn\u2019t masking her panic very well. \nDr. Nigel rubbed his chin. \u2018Half the city\u2019s sick with some sort of breathing complaint. I\u2019d say this was some sort of reaction to a tree or a bush. I\u2019d keep him away from any sort of new vegetation for a while.\u2019\n\u2018Did you hear that Toby?\u2019 Polly took Toby\u2019s hand. \u2018No trees and no bushes! And I\u2019m driving you to school from now on!\u2019\nToby nodded and mumbled through the oxygen mask, \u2018Yes mum!\u2019\nDr. Nigel squeezed his hand. \u2018Keep using that oxygen machine at night, you hear?\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir!\u2019\n\nToby\u2019s father was waiting anxiously in the family\u2019s sedan, tapping the steering wheel. He exhaled a sigh of relief as he saw Toby and Polly leaving through the sliding doors. \n\u2018What took so long? I was getting worried,\u2019 he said as he jumped out of the car and enveloped them in a bear hug. \n\u2018Oh Brian, Dr. Nigel thinks it might have been a plant,\u2019 Polly explained. \u2018We have to keep him away from trees and bushes.\u2019\n\u2018With the rate they\u2019re cutting them down in Reflection Bay, that won\u2019t be a problem at all,\u2019 Brian laughed. \u2018Hey Toby, did you tell the Doc we got here in world record time?\u2019\n\u2018Sorry dad. I forgot.\u2019\n\u2018Nigel might actually be impressed if we hadn\u2019t had so much practice!\u2019 Polly teased.\nAs they drove home, Toby stared at the passing scenery. The city skyline jutted through a thick layer of orange haze like dirty black fingers. A huge bill poster advertised Reflection Bay as the tourist destination of the year as voted by the residents of Reflection Bay. The pollution was so dense Toby couldn\u2019t see much more.\nHe looked out the other window and through the dim light, could just make out a large hill in the middle of the city. A dome of clear, clean air covered the thick forest growing there.\nBrian turned the family car into a street that ran along the boundary of the hill. Toby\u2019s house was one of the modest three bedroom dwellings that backed onto its perimeter. \nAs Brian pulled into the driveway, Toby focused on the high metal fence separating their backyard from the vast expanse of the forest. He had no idea why, but he felt a strange connection to the place. He\u2019d wanted to go exploring around it for as long as he could remember but there were rumors of a crazy old scientist who lived there who ate little kids who strayed onto his property. What\u2019s more, a boy at school told him that the crazy old man had a dog who chewed on the bones once the old man was done.\nToby shivered in his seat. Exploration would have to wait.\n\n\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== www.bonsaiwarriors.com ==\n* [http:\/\/www.example.com\/ example.com]\n\n<!--- Categories --->\n[[Category:Articles created via the Article Wizard]]","timestamp":"20160410104534","user-timestamp":"20150410104534"},{"title":"User:Daev","content":"==About Me==\n[[Image:Waterloo_crest.png|My school crest|thumb|100px]]\n[[Image:Flag of Canada.svg|My home country|thumb|100px]]\n\n* I am a Software Engineering student at the [[University of Waterloo]].\n* I started using Wikipedia in 2004, began editing in early 2005, and registered serveral months later.\n* I like beef stew.\n\n==Editing Habits==\n* Most of my edits are minor corrections and vandal removal.\n\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"25%\" style=\"right; margin-left:1em; margin-bottom:0,5em; background:none;\"\n|-\n|<center>Language skill box with [[Meta:Babel templates|Babel templates]]: <\/center>\n|-\n|{{User en}}{{User fr-1}}\n|-\n|}\n\n==Licenses==\n* Although I don't contribute much, I figure putting these licence agreements makes it look like I contribute more : )\n{{MultiLicenseMinorPD}}\n{{MultiLicenseWithCC-BySA-Any}}\n{{WikimediaTextLicensing}}","timestamp":"20160410104535","user-timestamp":"20150410104535"},{"title":"User talk:142.30.141.160","content":"\n\n== May 2008 ==\n[[Image:Information.svg|left|25px]] Welcome to Wikipedia.

Could this be listed in uncredited appearances or would that be speculation?[[User:JeffStickney|JeffStickney]] ([[User talk:JeffStickney|talk]]) 19:19, 19 February 2008 (UTC)\n\nIMDb isn't considered reliable. I'd say write a graph for the guest stars section with those other two refs and state that some reviewers thought the role was Munch but that HBO didn't confirm this and cite the ep summary.--[[User:Opark 77|Opark 77]] ([[User talk:Opark 77|talk]]) 19:47, 19 February 2008 (UTC)\n\n:HBO didn't credit him as anything. The show does not list character names in the closing credits. Opark probably listed him as \"bar patron\" because we can't say for sure that he's supposed to be Munch. How about a \"production\" section where the Belzer cameo is noted with the NPR and USA Today refs? \"I used to run bar.\" is an obvious reference to Munch as he owned a bar on Homicide. But until he or David Simon confirm that it is Munch, we can't definitely say.

His older brothers were [[Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon]] and [[George Hastings, 4th Earl of Huntingdon]].\n\nHe sat as [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Leicestershire (UK Parliament constituency)|Leicestershire]] (1571, 1584\u201387 and 1597\u201398), [[Somerset (UK Parliament constituency)|Somerset]] (1588\u201393 and 1604\u201311) and [[Bridgwater (UK Parliament constituency)|Bridgwater]] (1601). He also served as [[High Sheriff of Leicestershire]] in 1572 and 1581. He was knighted around 1589.\n\nHe built [[North Cadbury Court]] in North Cadbury, Somerset in 1581, where he died in 1610. He had married in 1569 Lady Maud Vernon (n\u00e9e Longford), daughter of Sir Ralph Longford and widow of Sir George Vernon. After her death he had married Mary Watkins.\n\nHe wrote a number of religious pamphlets in the Puritan cause.\n\n==References==\n* ''Concise Dictionary of National Biography'' (1930) <!-- pages?? -->\n* [[J.

[[Wikipedia:Verifiability|Verifiability]] is an important tool to achieve accuracy, so it is strongly recommended to check facts. However, don't be too keen to remove unverified information at the cost of completeness.\n\n====''Levels''====\n''[[Primary source]]s'': \n\n: \"''Piece of information or evidence that was created by someone who witnessed first hand or was part of the historical events that are being described''\".\n\nThese are sources which, usually, are recorded by someone who participated in, witnessed, or lived through the event. These are also usually authoritative and fundamental documents concerning the subject under consideration. This includes published original accounts, published original works, or published original research. Physical objects can be primary sources. \n\nWikipedia would not ordinarily be considered a primary source (see [[Wikipedia:No original research]]). Over time, however, this situation may change as researchers may use, for example, analyses of Wikipedia edits and reversions as evidence of shifts and changes in attitudes and approaches.\n\n''[[Secondary source]]s'':\n\n: \"''Piece of writings which were not penned contemporaneously with the events in question''\".\n\nThese are sources which, usually, are accounts, works, or research that analyze, assimilate, evaluate, interpret, and\/or synthesize primary sources. These are not as authoritative and are supplemental documents concerning the subject under consideration. This includes published accounts, published works, or published research.\n\nWikipedia would be considered a secondary source on some occasions.\n\n''[[Tertiary source]]s'':\n\nThese are sources which, on average, do not fall into the above two levels. They consist of generalized research of a specific subject under consideration. Tertiary sources are analyzed, assimilated, evaluated, interpreted, and\/or synthesized from secondary sources, also. These are not authoritative and are just supplemental documents concerning the subject under consideration. \n\nWikipedia would be considered a tertiary source on some occasions.\n\n===''Types''===\n: [todo] various types of sources\n\n<table width=\"100%\"><tr><td valign=top><small>\n* Published [[Document]]s\n** [[Map]]s\n** [[Literature]]\n*** [[Autobiography|Autobiographies]] <small>''(P)''<\/small>\n*** [[Biography|Biographies]] <small>''(S)''<\/small>\n*** [[Poem]]s\n*** [[Book]]s\n*** [[Magazine]]s <small>''(T)''<\/small>\n*** [[Newspaper]] articles <small>''(S)''<\/small>\n*** [[Pamphlet]]s <small>''(T)''<\/small>\n*** [[Poster]]s <small>''(P)''<\/small>\n** [[Advertisement]]s <small>''(P)''<\/small>\n** [[Research]] <small>''(P)''<\/small>\n*** [[Peer review|Peer Journal]]s <small>''(S)''<\/small>\n* Non-government documents\n** [[Organization]] papers <small>''(P)''<\/small>\n* Government documents <small>''(P)''<\/small>\n** [[public domain|Public record]]s <small>''(P)''<\/small>\n** [[Voter]] lists \n** [[Police]] records \n** [[Court]] records \n** Court hearings \n** Court proceedings \n** [[Tax]] accounts\n** [[Census]] data and records <small>''(P)''<\/small>\n** [[Classified information|Classified document]]s <small>''(P)''<\/small>\n** [[Law]]s <small>''(P)''<\/small>\n** [[Treaty|Treaties]] <small>''(P)''<\/small>\n** Court decisions <small>''(P)''<\/small>\n* Audio data\n** [[Oral history|Oral histories]] <small>''(P)''<\/small>\n** Oral traditions <small>''(S)''<\/small>\n** [[Spoken word]] <small>''(T)''<\/small>\n\n<\/small><\/td><td valign=top><small>\n* Unpublished Documents\n** Personal papers <small>''(P)''<\/small>\n*** [[Letter]]s <small>''(P)''<\/small>\n*** [[Diary|Diaries]] <small>''(P)''<\/small>\n*** [[Journal]]s <small>''(P)''<\/small>\n*** [[Will]]s <small>''(P)''<\/small>\n** Research\n*** [[Survey]]s\n*** Fieldwork\n** [[Report]]s\n** [[Speech]]es\n** [[Interview]]s\n** Membership records\n** Meeting transcripts\n** [[Finance|Financial accounts]]\n* Visual Documents\n** [[Art]]work\n** [[Statue]]s\n** [[Photograph]]s\n** [[Film]]s\n** [[Painting]]s\n* [[Artifact (archaeology)|Artifact]]s <small>''(P)''<\/small>\n** [[Coin]]s <small>''(P)''<\/small>\n** [[Inscription]]s <small>''(P)''<\/small>\n** [[Tool]]s <small>''(P)''<\/small>\n** [[Pottery]] <small>''(P)''<\/small>\n** Personal effects <small>''(P)''<\/small>\n*** [[Clothing]] <small>''(P)''<\/small>\n*** [[Jewelry]] <small>''(P)''<\/small>\n** [[Building]]s <small>''(P)''<\/small>\n** [[Furniture]] <small>''(P)''<\/small>\n<\/small><\/td><\/tr><\/table>\n\nThe letters after an item describes ''generally'' the type it is (though this can vary pending the exact source). ''P'' is for Primary sources, ''S'' is for Secondary sources, and ''T'' is for Tertiary sources.\n\n===Sourceberg===\nSee '''[http:\/\/sources.wikipedia.org\/ Wikisource]''' for original text (or primary sources). [[Wikisource]] (i.e., \"''Sourceberg''\") is a repository of source texts in any language which are either in the public domain, or are released under the GFDL.\n\n''See also'' : [[Wikipedia:Informative]], [[Wikipedia:Verifiability]], [[Wikipedia:Public domain resources]], [[Wikipedia:Don't include copies of primary sources]]\n\n== Style issues for history ==\n''Main article'': [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style]] (general style issues)\n\nIn historical articles, the '''past tense''' is strongly preferred. While history can be written in the present tense, the general audience of Wikipedia will usually expect the past tense on historical subjects and events that occurred in the past. The present tense in English is only correctly used to describe past events in a work of fiction. This is referred to as the \"historical past tense\".\n\nRemain objective as possible. The point and ideal of Wikipedia is to create an encyclopedic neutral body of knowledge. Avoid using the first-person point of view (emphasising the facts; not the editor). Explain the evidence (from the links and references) and explain the reasons of any conclusions.\n\n=== Article names ===\n''See'': [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Chinese)]], [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)]]\n\n'''Convention''': Use the form '''most familiar to English speakers'''. Name pages in English and place the native transliteration on the first line of the article unless the native form is more commonly used in English than the anglicized form.\n\n=== Infoboxes ===\nA number of infoboxes can be used for History related articles. These include {{tl|Infobox revolution biography}} and {{tl|Infobox Military Person}}.\n\n===Biography===\n''See:'' [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (biographies)]]\n\n=== Names and titles ===\nFor naming articles ''See'': [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (names and titles)]], for use in article content See [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (biographies)]]\n\n=== Dates ===\n''See:'' [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)]]\n\nThe [[Gregorian calendar]] is the calendar currently used in the [[Western world]].

(as a linked seperate entry)\n*List of weapons, with descriptions? (as a linked seperate entry)\n\nNot sure if those last two would be going overboard.\n\n[[User:Some guy|Some guy]] 21:20, 7 September 2005 (UTC)\n\nWhy do people keep double linking Mark Hamill? He's already linked, a paragraph above...\n\n:I think the Hercs and tanks should be in a seperate article, but I can add them with my trusty big packet.

I've removed tags for Ernesto Navarre, Bek Storm, Lobita Blanca, and the Turkhazakistan Debacle. These elements of the game are too minor to warrant their own articles. We can't go cluttering up Wikipedia with numerous articles about the game (see [[Wikipedia:fancruft|fancruft]]). I changed \"best HERC pilots in the solar system\" back to \"in the Empire\", because there is no evidence that they are necessarily better than all of the Cybrids, nor that there are any HERC pilots ''out'' of the solar system. Obviously there is no need for POV interjections such as \", surprisingly\" after the fact that Hamill voices Caanon. The comment about Holy Hand Grenades is questionable but I left it in. [[User:Some guy|Some guy]] 00:15, 28 October 2005 (UTC)\n\n==Minor Change, 7 February 2006==\nFirstly, my compliments on this article.  I've been a longtime fan of the Metaltech universe, and happened upon this entry as a result of curiosity--it's nice to see that Starsiege has recieved some credit.\n\nI only made one VERY minor change, and that was the the maximum allowable weapons on a tank is in fact THREE, not two as was stated.  While the vast majority of tanks could only mount two, there was the notable exception of the cybrid \"Recluse\" tank which featured three weapon mounts.\n[[User:69.6.103.104|69.6.103.104]] 02:17, 8 February 2006 (UTC)\n:Thanks for the correction. I forgot about the Recluse. That's a pretty simple change. In the future, don't worry about adding a bit to the discussion page over a single word edit, just put it in your edit summary.[[User:Some guy|Some guy]] 05:24, 8 February 2006 (UTC)\n\n==The use of IT==\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but isn't the capitalised form of it \"It\"? We don't around calling God HE, do we? No we, use He instead. So why should it be different for Prometheus? I'm confused...\n:It's spelled IT in the Compendium and probably in the game as well.

If only to find the feellow who wrote\/performed mechsoul (track 6\/7)\n\n== Minor Change: April 2, 2006 ==\nBarak:\n\nI made a minor change to the wording in, \"The Future\" to reflect the fact that the game IS still actually played.\n\nI also reorder the links to reflect the sites that are actively used by Starsiege players, as well as adding links to The JunkYard and SSplayers.\n\nOkay why exactly were the changes I made removed?  After reading over the page I decided it made Starsiege sound completely dead, and 2845 as the only hope for the future.  I found the minor wording changes didn't take away from the article at all.\n\nAs it stands the article makes Starsiege sound completely unplayable do to bugs, which isn't true at all.\n\n== Unnecessary removal of peoples' contributions: please knock it off. ==\n\nNo one owns the Starsiege Wikipedia entry and it is no one's place to edit correct, factual information out of it.  Do us all a favor and leave it the hell alone unless you're adding something or making an actual correction of faulty data, which has not been the case for the vast majority of past or present edits.  Thanks y'all.  (No, it's not my edits that got removed, but someone else in the community who doesn't use this forum and I'm posting on his behalf.)\n:Most recent edits have been for typos or by bots fixing minor problems. Are you referring to my recent removal of the \"amazing\" comment? [[User:Some guy|Some guy]] 01:55, 3 April 2006 (UTC)\n\n==Zeitgeist?==\nI don't remember this term. I'd guess it's from a German version of Starsiege or something like that. Can anyone confirm? [[User:Some guy|Some guy]] 02:12, 3 April 2006 (UTC)\n\nZeitgeist was a Metagen\/\/heretic unit which was destroyed by the player in the Cybrid campaign (mission Heresy\/\/Dissonance).\n-Maestro\n\n== Amazing line ==\n\nActually he was referring to that.  Though you may not believe this, most Starsiege players don't frequent the 2845 site.  \n\nThe section of the article that refers to a rift between the people that use VuGames forums and the 2845 ones is slightly bogus.  Neither set of people on EITHER site actually actively play STARSIEGE which the article was written about.  The VuGames forums actually has no Starsiege content at all, and is more of a social hangout for players that played between 4 and 6 years ago than an active forum.  The SS2845 Site has minimal actual Starsiege content and is more setup to be used as a sounding board for SS2845.\n\nThe main site that still supports Starsiege players is www.sunandshadows.com, with the www.ss2845.com site and www.starsiegeplayers.com having the same amount of activity from Starsiege players, basically being almost none at all.\n\nI'd suggest if an article is needed to be written to support SS2845, that the article in question be written ABOUT SS2845.\n:Okay. So, he thinks it's amazing that people still play Starsiege. That's an opinion. I don't think it's amazing. Check out [[WP:NPOV|Wikipedia's policy on neutral point of view]] Also, it should have been in the Community section, not the Future section. I'm not sure how it relates to the number of people who play, but I don't visit the 2845 site. I won't argue that the VU forums never discuss SS, but that doesn't mean this should become a S&S ad either. Anyway, I don't care if people edit the article, as long as it stays encyclopedic.

I can do it all myself, u sure u dont want it? it might give other ppl some more knowledge of SS, plus there are many great houses and alliences though they do not have a direct impact in the game story, they still have some role in the universe (SS has a very complicated history, I know this because I still have both the original Starsiege booklet)\n\n::and yes many ppl are interested in the SS story, I had 4 classmates who ask about the SS universe.  But it's all up to u, I'm not here to dominate\n\n::by:[[User:AWP_Lizard|AWP_Lizard]]\n\n:::Realisitically, not very many people will care about Starsiege, probably very few outside of those who play or have played the game. Anyone who really cared could look up the information, but I seriously doubt anyone without the game will have any interest in the squadmates. The squadmates' backgrounds, the different houses, the metrozones, a vast majority of the details aren't nearly important enough to be included on Wikipedia. You might want to check pages on [[WP:NOTABILITY]] and [[Wikipedia:Fancruft|Fancruft]]. I have the Compendium and other sources and I know a lot of the background, but again it's not important enough to be notable here.

Considering how much resentment I have towards the Clancore team for putting the nail in the coffin as far as anyone else getting rights to use the Starsiege franchise IP, I think it would be better if you wrote it.  -- Barak\n\n\nI fail to see any relevance whatsoever, to Starsiege or this article, in advertising what the Clancore Development Group is doing at the moment. Their new project has nothing to do with the future of Starsiege, and they have taken great pains to completely disassociate themselves from the game. The phrase \"Immediatley(sic) following the cancelation(sic) of 2845, some of the developers had partnered with a small group known as SSMods.com to create a new mech combat game akin to the starsiege universe. The game is currently underdevelopment(sic) and updates can be viewed at SSMods.com\" has absolutely nothing to do with, and has no bearing on, Starsiege. \n\nPerhaps when Clancore has actually finished production on even a single new video game project then they, and it, might earn their own article elsewhere in Wikipedia, but this looks like an attempt at free publicity by trying to link their new, non-Starsiege, project to the Starsiege game and ride its coattails. Spelling errors aside, they should also have been respectful enough to capitalize 'Starsiege'. Phrase removed. \n\nPublicity again seems to be the reason for the two external links to CCDG's web site within 5 words of each other in just one sentence, this line: \"... begun in April 2003, by Clancore Design Group called Starsiege: 2845, was officially allowed...) Both links take you to the exact same CCDG page dealing with their non-Starsiege project, and neither link belongs in this article.

I was hoping people could be mature, but that is obviously not the case. From this point, do not add any links to any squad sites on the page, as they violate Wikipedia rules and guidelines from [[Wikipedia:External links]], and will be removed. \n\nYou disgrace the game and the community.

Rowing historians indicate that sliding seats were first used during the Fours racing at Oxford in 1872 by PCBC and that ''\u201cthe new system of sliding seats was first used in Oxford by Lesley\u2019s crew and also by the College (Pembroke) Eight at Henley \u201c''.<ref>W E Sherwood, p.<\/ref> Pembroke were the first known crew to use seats with wheels.<ref>Burnell, Swing Together, Thoughts on Rowing, OUP, Oxford, 1952<\/ref> In the club minutes it is recorded that the Pembroke crew were the pioneers of the sliding seat at Oxford, using it in the Fours before they left for Henley, and of the seat with wheels for the first time worldwide.<ref>It would seem that the Pembroke College Boat Club Minutes provide reliable original source evidence of the truth of the statement<\/ref>\n\nDodd<ref>Henley Royal Regatta, 1981<\/ref> states that [[London Rowing Club]] and Pembroke were the first to use the sliding seat at Henley. Pembroke\u2019s win of the Visitors\u2019 Cup at Henley has been described as \"one of the best races of the whole Regatta\".<ref>Jackson\u2019s Oxford Journal, 1872<\/ref> Pembroke won by approximately half a length from [[University College Dublin]], who were using fixed seats. The Dublin crew were regarded as one of the best ever sent to Henley. What is also significant is that Pembroke were using wheels, which were soon discarded by boat builders in favour of greased glass or steel grooves or tubes, but wheels were to return to favour again in 1885. Pembroke then, were not only early adopters of the sliding seat, ahead of others in Oxford, but also pioneers in terms of the materials being used, as they anticipated the later wheeled models of sliding seats which did not become current until 1885 and remain until the modern day.\n\n===Modern day===\nIn 2003, Pembroke achieved a historic victory in the Oxford [[Summer Eights]] competition by becoming the first college to win the 'Double Headship' - having both men's and women's first boats end the week at the 'Head of the River'.  Double Headship has yet to be repeated by any college in the Summer Eights competition, although the competitive years since 2003 has seen both men's and women's boats remain within striking distance of the Head of the River. Consistent ambition to go Head has been the goal: the Men's First Summer Eight (M1) has remained within the top 5 since 1992<ref>http:\/\/www.atm.ox.ac.uk\/rowing\/bumps\/pemb\/pemb_me.html<\/ref> and within the top 3 during that time in all years except 2008. In 2013, the 1st VIII bumped Oriel to regain the Head of the River whilst the First Torpid also retained the [[Torpids]] Headship.\n\nPCBC is supported by the Friends of PCBC who strive to support rowers at all levels, particularly through their scholarship programme.<ref>{{cite web|title=PCBC|url=http:\/\/www.usrowers.com\/pcbc\/contents.php?page=grants|accessdate=16 March 2013}}<\/ref>  PCBC has also has a strong current record in external regattas: M1 placed 42nd in the [[Head of the River Race|HORR]] in 2012 and competed in the [[Temple Challenge Cup]] at [[Henley Royal Regatta]] in 2006 and 2012.\n\n===Rivalries===\nAlthough tension began to ease off as of 2006, Pembroke and [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]], historically two of the best performing crews of the past 30 years, have had a strong and at times heated rivalry. In 2009, Pembroke's Eights M1 achieved a particularly emphatic bump on Oriel, further fuelling the rivalry. The rivalry remains fierce, including childish edits of Wikipedia pages.\n\n[[St Edmund Hall Boat Club]], whose boat house is adjacent to that of Pembroke, are also rivals, particularly on the women's side. The traditional Pembroke rivalry with [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] permeates to rowing as well. Recent strong performances at the Fairbairn's Cup in Cambridge and the Oxford vs Cambridge College race at [[Henley Boat Races]] has led to new rivalries with some Cambridge colleges such as [[First and Third Trinity Boat Club]] and [[Caius Boat Club]]. Pembroke became the first male Oxford college crew to win the Fairbairn Cup in 2014, an achievement they repeated in 2015.\n\n==Facilities==\n\n===Equipment===\nThe club has a reputation for good equipment and coaching. The men's side of the club has three [[Empacher]] VIIIs (2008, 2003, 1994), two [[Janousek]]s (2000, 1990) and a Sims. The top women had a Stampfli VIII (2005) which was written off at the [[Women's Eights Head of the River Race]] 2007 after being crashed into Putney Bridge. This has now been replaced and was used by the Women's 1st VIII to gain blades from the bottom of Division I in Torpids 2008. They also have an Eton Phoenix (1996), a Janousek and an [[Aylings]]. In small boats the club maintains a fleet of one Empacher coxless four (2008), three Janousek coxed-fours, a Janousek coxless-pair and a single scull. In addition there are two Eton coaching launches for the men's and women's 1st VIIIs. In general the top boats are replaced every four years, with purchases alternating between men and women every two years.\n\nPembroke has a gymnasium at the boat house and is one of a very limited number of clubs to possess a fleet of 10 Concept D ergos (2008) which are situated adjacent to the weights gymnasium.\n\n===Coaching===\nRecent coaches have included Ben Lewis, current [[Thames Rowing Club]] coach; GB coach Rob Dauncey and GB lightweights [[Chris Bartley (rower)|Chris Bartley]]<ref>{{cite web|title=GB Rowing: Chris Bartley|url=http:\/\/www.britishrowing.org\/gb\/biographies\/chris-bartley|accessdate=16 March 2013}}<\/ref>  and [[Simon Jones (rower)|Simon Jones]], and John Gearing (former-South African international and Master in Charge of Rowing at [[Radley College]]).\n\nThe college has also recently created one of the only permanent college coaching staff positions in Oxford to further increase the quality of its training system. The first coach to take this position on was Barrie-Jon Mulder, from 2011-2014. He was succeeded by Rory Copus for the 2014\/2015 season, whilst the current coach is Justin Sutherland, shared with Upper Thames Rowing Club.\n\n===Training locations===\nNovice and development crews train on the local Isis river by the boathouse but senior crews train further afield. In recent years both the men and women's senior squads have trained at [[Radley College]]'s boat house. In the past, senior crews have trained at [[St Edward's School, Oxford|St Edward's]] boathouse, [[Abingdon School]]'s boat house and [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]].\n\n==Results==\n[[File:PCBC VIIIs 2007.JPG|thumb|Pembroke College Boat House on the [[River Thames|Isis]] during [[Summer Eights|VIIIs Week]] 2007.]]\n\nIn 2013, for the first time since 1903, the M1 Torpid maintained its Headship with female double Olympic gold medallist [[Caryn Davies]] at stroke.  The Women's First Eight was the first to gain Headship from a mixed college in 2000 and held that position for four straight years;<ref>http:\/\/www.atm.ox.ac.uk\/rowing\/bumps\/pemb\/pemb_we.html<\/ref> they are Head of the River again in 2012. In 2015 the Women's 1st VIII bumped up from 4th to 2nd on the river and was clearly the fastest boat on the river, closing down on [[Wadham College Boat Club|Wadham]] on the Friday and Saturday to gain the Headship, but eventually missed out by less than half of a length.\n\nLower down in the club, Pembroke's development program is one of the most successful in Oxford College Rowing, and has produced more [[Oxford University Boat Club|Blues]] in the last 10 years than any other college.
